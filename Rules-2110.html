<br>SUBCHAPTER III—MISCELLANEOUS
<br>§57531. Construction and charter of vessels for unsuccessful routes
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—If the Secretary of Transportation finds that a trade route determined to be essential under section 50103 of this title cannot be successfully developed and maintained and the Secretary's replacement program cannot be achieved under private operation of the trade route by a citizen of the United States with vessels documented under chapter 121 of this title, without further aid by the United States Government in addition to the financial aid authorized under title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, the Secretary, without advertisement or competition, may—
<br>
<br>(1) have constructed, in private shipyards or in navy yards, vessels of the types necessary for the trade route; and
<br>
<br>(2) demise charter those new vessels to the operator of vessels of the United States established on the trade route.
<br>
<br>(b) Amount of Charter Hire.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The annual charter hire under subsection (a) shall be at least 4 percent of the price (referred to in this section as the "foreign cost") at which the vessel would be sold if constructed under title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, plus—
<br>
<br>(A) a percentage of the depreciated foreign cost computed annually determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the term of the charter, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth percent; and
<br>
<br>(B) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs.
<br>
<br>(2) Depreciation.—Depreciation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be based on—
<br>
<br>(A) a 25-year life for dry-cargo and passenger vessels; and
<br>
<br>(B) a 20-year life for tankers and other bulk liquid carrier vessels.
<br>
<br>(c) Option To Purchase.—The charter may contain an option to the charterer to purchase the vessels from the Secretary of Transportation within 5 years after delivery under the charter, on the same terms and conditions as provided in title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, for the purchase of new vessels from the Secretary. However—
<br>
<br>(1) the purchase price shall be the foreign cost less depreciation to the date of purchase based on the useful life specified in subsection (b)(2);
<br>
<br>(2) the required cash payment payable at the time of the purchase shall be 25 percent of the purchase price;
<br>
<br>(3) the charter may provide that any part of the charter hire paid in excess of the minimum charter hire provided for in this section may be credited against the cash payment payable at the time of the purchase;
<br>
<br>(4) the balance of the purchase price shall be paid within the remaining years of useful life (as specified in subsection (b)(2)) after the date of delivery of the vessel under the charter and in approximately equal annual installments, except that the first installment, which shall be payable on the next ensuing anniversary date of the delivery under the charter, shall be a proportionate part of the annual installment; and
<br>
<br>(5) interest shall be payable on the unpaid balances from the date of purchase, at a rate not less than—
<br>
<br>(A) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of the loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth percent; plus
<br>
<br>(B) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs.
<br>
<br>(d) Operation of Vessel.—
<br>
<br>(1) Permissible voyages.—The charter shall provide for operation of the vessel exclusively—
<br>
<br>(A) in foreign trade;
<br>
<br>(B) on a round-the-world voyage;
<br>
<br>(C) on a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port that includes an intercoastal port of the United States;
<br>
<br>(D) on a round voyage from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Orient that includes an intercoastal port of the United States; or
<br>
<br>(E) on a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at Hawaii or an island territory or possession of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Domestic trade.—The charter shall provide if the vessel is operated in domestic trade on any of the services specified in paragraph (1), the charterer will pay annually to the Secretary of Transportation that proportion of 1/25 of the difference between the domestic and foreign cost of the vessel as the gross revenue derived from the domestic trade bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyages completed during the preceding year.

<br>        
<br>§58101. Operating in domestic intercoastal or coastwise service
<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition.—A subsidy may not be awarded or paid to a contractor under the operating-differential subsidy program, and a vessel may not be chartered to a person under chapter 575 of this title, if the contractor or charterer, or a holding company, subsidiary, affiliate, or associate of the contractor or charterer, or an officer, director, agent, or executive thereof, directly or indirectly—
<br>
<br>(1) owns, charters, or operates a vessel engaged in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service; or
<br>
<br>(2) owns a pecuniary interest in a person that owns, charters, or operates a vessel in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service.
<br>
<br>(b) Waiver.—A person may apply to the Secretary of Transportation for a waiver of subsection (a). Before deciding on the waiver, the Secretary shall give the applicant and other interested persons an opportunity for a hearing. The Secretary may not grant the waiver if the Secretary finds it would—
<br>
<br>(1) result in unfair competition to a person operating exclusively in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service; or
<br>
<br>(2) be prejudicial to the objectives and policy of this subtitle.
<br>
<br>(c) Continuous Operation Since 1935.—The Secretary shall grant an application under subsection (b) without requiring further proof that the public interest and convenience will be served and without further proceedings as to the competition in the route or trade, if the contractor or other person, or a predecessor in interest, was in bona-fide operation as a common carrier by water in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise trade in 1935 over the route or in the trade for which the application is made and has so operated since that time or, if engaged in furnishing seasonal service only, was in bona-fide operation in 1935 during the season ordinarily covered by its operation, except in either event as to interruptions of service over which the applicant or its predecessor in interest had no control.
<br>
<br>(d) Diversion Into Intercoastal or Coastwise Operations.—If an application under subsection (b) is approved, a person referred to in this section may not divert, directly or indirectly, money, property, or any other thing of value, used in a foreign-trade operation for which a subsidy is paid by the United States Government, into intercoastal or coastwise operations.

<br>
<br>In this chapter, references to the "operating-differential subsidy program" are substituted for references to "part A of subchapter VI of this chapter", meaning 46 App. U.S.C. 1171–1185a, because part A of subchapter VI contains the operating-differential subsidy program and under 46 App. U.S.C. 1185a that program is being phased out. Consequently, part A is being omitted from the revised title and will instead appear as a note under section 53101, except for 46 App. U.S.C. 1177 and 1177–l which are restated in chapter 535. References to "chapter 575 of this title" are substituted for references to "subchapter VII of this chapter", meaning 46 App. U.S.C. 1191–1205, because those sections are restated in chapter 575.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "A person may apply to the Secretary of Transportation for a waiver of subsection (a). Before deciding on the waiver, the Secretary shall give the applicant and other interested persons an opportunity for a hearing." are substituted for "without the written permission of the Secretary of Transportation. Every person, firm, or corporation having any interest in such application shall be permitted to intervene and the Secretary of Transportation shall give a hearing to the applicant and the intervenors." for clarity.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "domestic intercoastal or coastwise trade" are substituted for "domestic, intercoastal, or coastwise trade" for consistency in the section.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "and whosoever shall violate this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor" are omitted because section 3559 of title 18 provides for the classification of offenses. See the revision notes for section 58109 of the revised title.
<br>§58102. Default on payment or maintenance of reserves
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Transportation may supervise the number and compensation of all officers and employees of a contractor under the operating-differential subsidy program or a charterer under chapter 575 of this title, receiving an operating-differential subsidy, if the contractor or charterer—
<br>
<br>(1) is in default on a mortgage, note, purchase contract, or other obligation to the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(2) has not maintained, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, all of the reserves provided for in this subtitle.

<br>§58103. Employing another person as managing or operating agent
<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition.—Except with the written consent of the Secretary of Transportation, a contractor holding a contract under the operating-differential subsidy program or under chapter 575 of this title may not—
<br>
<br>(1) employ another person as the managing or operating agent of the operator; or
<br>
<br>(2) charter a vessel, on which an operating-differential subsidy is to be paid, for operation by another person.
<br>
<br>(b) Applicability of Provisions to Charterer.—If a charter prohibited by this section is made, the person operating the chartered vessel is subject to all the provisions of this subtitle and the operating-differential subsidy program, including limitations of profits and salaries.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "United States Government" are substituted for "United States or any agency of the United States" for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "bring a civil action" are substituted for "sue" for consistency in the revised title. The words "without respect to the amount in controversy" are omitted because section 1331 of title 28 no longer contains a requirement of any particular amount in controversy for jurisdiction of civil actions arising under the laws of the United States. The words "If the person prevails" are added for clarity.
<br>§58107. Discrimination at ports by water common carriers
<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition.—A common carrier by water may not, directly or indirectly, through an agreement, conference, association, understanding, or otherwise, prevent or attempt to prevent any other common carrier by water from serving any port described in subsection (b) at the same rates the first carrier charges at the nearest port already regularly served by it.
<br>
<br>(b) Ports.—A port referred to in subsection (a) is one that is—
<br>
<br>(1) designed for the accommodation of ocean-going vessels;
<br>
<br>(2) located on an improvement project authorized by law or by a Federal agency; and
<br>
<br>(3) located within the continental limits of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) Other Authority Not Limited.—This section does not limit the authority otherwise vested in the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Maritime Commission.

<br>§58108. Charges for transportation subject to subtitle IV of title 49
<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition.—A carrier may not charge, collect, or receive for transportation subject to subtitle IV of title 49 of persons or property, under any joint rate, fare, or charge, or under any export, import, or other proportional rate, fare, or charge, that is based in whole or in part on the fact that the persons or property affected are to be transported to, or have been transported from, a port in a territory or possession of the United States or in a foreign country, by a carrier by water in foreign commerce, any lower rate, fare, or charge than the carrier charges, collects, or receives for the transportation of persons or similar property for the same distance, in the same direction, and over the same route, in commerce wholly within the United States, unless the vessel used for the transportation is or was at the time of the transportation documented under the laws of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Suspension of Prohibition.—Whenever the Secretary of Transportation believes that adequate shipping facilities to or from any port in a territory or possession of the United States or a foreign country are not being provided by vessels documented under the laws of the United States, the Secretary shall certify this fact to the Surface Transportation Board. On receiving the certification, the Board may by order suspend the operation of subsection (a) with respect to the rates, fares, and charges for the transportation by rail of persons and property transported from or to be transported to those ports, for such time and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify in the order or in any supplemental order.
<br>
<br>(c) Termination of Suspension.—Whenever the Secretary believes that adequate shipping facilities are being provided to those ports by vessels documented under the laws of the United States, and certifies that fact to the Board, the Board may order the termination of the suspension.

<br>In subsection (a), the word "individual" is substituted for "natural person" for consistency in the revised title. The words "convicted of violating section 58101(d), 58103, or 58105 of this title" are substituted for "found guilty of any act or acts declared in this chapter to constitute a misdemeanor" because the sections referred to restate the provisions which declare certain acts to be misdemeanors and because the restatement of those provisions does not use the word "misdemeanor". The words "in any district court of the United States" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for at least one year but not more than five years, or both" are substituted for "shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not less than one year or more than five years, or by both fine and imprisonment" because of chapter 227 of title 18. See 18 U.S.C. 3559 (which classifies offenses based on the maximum term of imprisonment) and 3571 (which establishes fines based on those classifications).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the word "organization" is substituted for "corporation" to reflect the probable intent that the penalty should apply to other organizations in addition to corporations. The words "convicted of committing an act prohibited by this subtitle" are substituted for "found guilty of any act or acts declared in this chapter to be unlawful" for clarity and consistency. The words "shall be fined under title 18" are substituted for "shall be punished by a fine of not more than $25,000" for consistency with subsection (a).

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security is substituted for the Commissioner of Customs because the functions of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the Commissioner of Customs previously were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury under section 321(c) of title 31. For prior related transfers of functions, see the transfer of functions note under 46 App. U.S.C. 163. The word "shall" is substituted for "is authorized and directed to" for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "port" is substituted for "seaports" for consistency in the revised title. The word "secured" is substituted for "placed in security" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "from time to time", "properly", and "and for that purpose to employ any of the officers of the United States Customs Service" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 6 months, or both" are substituted for "subject to a penalty of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both" because of chapter 227 of title 18. The words "in the discretion of the court" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "section 2279 of title 18" are substituted for "section forty-six hundred and six of the Revised Statutes" in the Act of Mar. 31, 1900, because R.S. §4606 (formerly classified to 46 U.S.C. 708 (1946 ed.)) was replaced by 18 U.S.C. 2279 in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683). The words "section 9 of act August 2, 1882 (22 Stat. 189)" are omitted because that law was repealed by section 4(b) of Public Law 98–89 (Aug. 26, 1983, 97 Stat. 600).
<br>§60102. Production of certificate on entry
<br>
<br>On entry of a vessel documented under chapter 121 of this title, the master or other individual in charge of the vessel shall produce the certificate of documentation to the customs officer at the place where the vessel is entered. If the certificate is not produced, the vessel is not entitled to the privileges of a documented vessel.

The words "in charge" are substituted for "having the command or charge" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "customs officer" are substituted for "collector of the district" because the office of collector of customs was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965. For additional requirements relating to entry of vessels, see 19 U.S.C. 1434.
<br>§60103. Oath of ownership on entry
<br>
<br>(a) Required Statement.—On entry of a vessel of the United States from a foreign port, the individual designated under subsection (b) shall state under oath that—
<br>
<br>(1) the vessel's certificate of documentation contains the names of all the owners of the vessel; or
<br>
<br>(2) part of the ownership has been transferred since the certificate was issued and, to the best of the individual's knowledge and belief, the vessel is still owned only by citizens of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Person To Make Statement.—The statement under subsection (a) shall be made by—
<br>
<br>(1) an owner if one resides at the port of entry; or
<br>
<br>(2) the master if an owner does not reside at the port of entry.
<br>
<br>(c) Consequence of Not Making Statement.—If the appropriate individual does not make the statement required by this section, the vessel is not entitled to the privileges of a vessel of the United States.

<br>§60104. Depositing certificates of documentation with consular officers
<br>
<br>(a) Requirement of Master.—When a vessel owned by citizens of the United States, on a voyage from a port in the United States, arrives at a foreign port, the master of the vessel shall deposit the vessel's certificate of documentation with a consular officer at the foreign port if there is a consular officer at that port.
<br>
<br>(b) Return of Certificate.—When the master produces a clearance from the appropriate officer of the foreign port, the consular officer shall return the certificate of documentation to the master if the master has complied with the provisions of law related to the discharge of seamen in a foreign country and the payment of fees of consular officers.
<br>
<br>(c) Civil Penalty and Collection.—The master of a vessel failing to deposit the certificate of documentation as required by subsection (a) is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $500.

<br>
<br>(2) permit clearance to be obtained before all requirements for clearance are complied with, but only if the owner or operator of the vessel files a bond in an amount set by the Secretary conditioned on the compliance by the owner or operator with all specified requirements for clearance within a time period (not exceeding 4 business days) established by the Secretary; and
<br>

<br>§60302. Special tonnage taxes

<br>
<br>(1) 30 cents per ton on a vessel built in the United States but owned in any part by a subject of a foreign country.
<br>
<br>(2) 50 cents per ton on other vessels not of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) 50 cents per ton on a vessel of the United States having an officer who is not a citizen of the United States.
<br>

<br>
<br>(b) Vessels Not of the United States Transporting Property Between Districts.—Regardless of whether a tax is imposed under section 60301 of this title, a tax of 50 cents per ton is imposed on a vessel not of the United States at each entry in one customs district from another district when transporting goods loaded in one district to be delivered in another district.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(3), the words "vessel of the United States" are substituted for "vessel" for clarity.

A codification note which first appeared in the 1958 edition of the United States Code for 46 U.S.C. 121 says that the words apparently were omitted as superseded and repealed by section 14 of the Act of June 26, 1884 (ch. 121, 23 Stat. 57), as amended by section 11 of the Act of June 19, 1886 (ch. 421, 24 Stat. 81), and section 1 of the Act of April 4, 1888 (ch. 61, 25 Stat. 80).

<br>
<br>(B) on entry of the vessel from a foreign port, the individual designated under paragraph (2) states under oath that—
<br>
<br>(i) the document contains the names of all the owners of the vessel; or
<br>
<br>(ii) part of the ownership has been transferred since the document was issued and, to the best of that individual's knowledge and belief, the vessel is still owned only by citizens of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Person to make statement.—The statement under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made by—
<br>
<br>(A) an owner if one resides at the port of entry; or
<br>
<br>(B) the master if an owner does not reside at the port of entry.
<br>
<br>(c) Exception for Vessels Becoming Documented.—Subsection (a) does not apply to a vessel that—
<br>

<br>Subsection (d) is substituted for "All goods, wares, or merchandise imported contrary to this section or section 128 of this title, and the vessel wherein the same shall be imported, together with her cargo, tackle, apparel, and furniture, shall be forfeited to the United States; and such goods, wares, or merchandise, ship, or vessel, and cargo shall be liable to be seized, prosecuted, and condemned in like manner, and under the same regulations, restrictions, and provisions as have been heretofore established for the recovery, collection, distribution, and remission of forfeitures to the United States by the several revenue laws" to eliminate unnecessary words.

<br>
<br>(a) Imposition of Duty.—A discriminating duty of 10 percent ad valorem (in addition to other duties imposed by law) is imposed on goods—
<br>
<br>(1) imported in a vessel not of the United States unless the vessel—
<br>
<br>(A) is entitled by law or treaty to enter the ports of the United States on payment of the same duties as are payable on goods imported in a vessel of the United States; or
<br>
<br>(B)(i) is owned only by citizens of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) after entering a port of the United States, becomes documented as a vessel of the United States before leaving that port; or
<br>
<br>(2) produced or manufactured in a foreign country not contiguous to the United States and imported from a country contiguous to the United States, unless imported in the usual course of strictly retail trade.
<br>
<br>(b) Seizure and Forfeiture.—If goods are imported without payment of the duty required by this section, the goods and the vessel in which they are imported may be seized by, and forfeited to, the United States Government.

<br>
<br>(b) Effective and Expiration Dates.—A suspension under this section takes effect retroactively from the date the President received the proof from the foreign government, and expires when that government stops granting the reciprocal suspension.

<br>
<br>When the President is satisfied that yachts owned by residents of the United States and used only for pleasure are allowed to arrive at, depart from, and cruise in the waters of a foreign port without entering, clearing, or paying any duties or fees (including cruising license fees), the Secretary of Homeland Security may allow yachts from that foreign port used only for pleasure to arrive at and depart from the ports of the United States and to cruise in the waters of the United States without paying any duties or fees. However, the Secretary may require foreign yachts to obtain a license to cruise in the waters of the United States. The license shall be in the form prescribed by the Secretary and contain limitations about length of time, direction, place of cruising and action, and other matters the Secretary considers appropriate. The license shall be issued without cost to the yacht.
