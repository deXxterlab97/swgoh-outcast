<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§246, 247, 252, 661, 662c, 753i, 910 (R.S. §5277; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§141, 143, 35 Stat. 1114; May 14, 1930, ch. 274, §10, 46 Stat. 327; May 27, 1930, ch. 339, §10, 46 Stat. 390; Mar. 22, 1934, ch. 73, §2, 48 Stat. 455; May 18, 1934, ch. 303, §1, 48 Stat. 782).
<br>
<br>Section consolidated escape and rescue provisions of sections 246, 247, 252, 661, 662c, 753i, and 910 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Remaining provisions of those sections are in sections 1071, 1072, 1502, 1792, 3183, and 3195 of this title.
<br>
<br>No two sections provided the same punishment. Every section except said section 252 made the offense a misdemeanor by providing for fines varying from $500 to $1,000 and terms of imprisonment varying from 6 months to 1 year. Said section 252, representing the latest expression by Congress, provided for 10 years' imprisonment.
<br>
<br>The punishment provision was adopted from section 751 of this title, which makes it unlawful for a prisoner to escape from his place of confinement. Thus the same punishment would apply to the person aiding in an escape as to the person escaping.
<br>
<br>The language of this section reconciles the conflict by adopting a penalty which is a compromise between the varying provisions.
<br>
<br>Reference to "extradition" was inserted to avoid ambiguity and to harmonize section with section 751 of this title.
<br>
<br>References to "force" were omitted as well as those to "officer" or "custody." See definition of "Rescue," Black's Law Dictionary, citing 4 Bl. Comm. 131.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>
<br>Sections 244, 662e and 665 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. The two latter sections merely extended application of the former. This section has been greatly condensed by changes in phraseology which do not affect the substance.
<br>
<br>Enumeration of "marshal, deputy marshal, ministerial officer, or other person," was omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>Provision making section applicable to cases of prisoners in custody pending extradition or removal proceedings as well as prisoners convicted of offenses against the United States was likewise omitted as unnecessary.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Short Title of 1982 Amendment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 97–351, §1, Oct. 18, 1982, 96 Stat. 1663, provided that: "This Act [enacting this section and amending section 1116 of this title] may be cited as the 'Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material Implementation Act of 1982'."
<br>Findings and Purpose of Title V of Pub. L. 104–132 Relating to Nuclear Materials
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 104–132, title V, §501, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1281, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can be used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as substantial damage to property and to the environment;
<br>
<br>"(2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the United States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for their offenses;
<br>
<br>"(4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the legislation that implemented the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of title 18, United States Code;
<br>
<br>"(5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, thereby decreasing the security of such materials by increasing the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;
<br>
<br>"(6) the trafficking in the relatively more common, commercially available, and usable nuclear and byproduct materials creates the potential for significant loss of life and environmental damage;
<br>
<br>"(7) report trafficking incidents in the early 1990's suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking in these materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently conducted their black market sales of these materials within the Federal Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, the former Soviet Union, Central Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Middle European countries;
<br>
<br>"(8) the international community has become increasingly concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials;
<br>
<br>"(9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a significant threat that the United States must use all lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such materials;
<br>
<br>"(10) the United States has an interest in encouraging United States corporations to do business in the countries that comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other developing democracies;
<br>
<br>"(11) protection of such United States corporations from threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is important to the success of the effort to encourage business ventures in these countries, and to further the foreign relations and commerce of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may affect the health, environment, and property of United States nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal activity occur outside the territory of the United States, and are primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and
<br>
<br>"(13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that provides adequate protection to United States interests from nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held for other than peaceful purposes.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this title [enacting section 2332c of this title, amending this section and sections 175, 177, 178, and 2332a of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under section 262 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, and section 1522 of Title 50, War and National Defense] is to provide Federal law enforcement agencies with the necessary means and the maximum authority permissible under the Constitution to combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation that may result from the illegal possession and use of radioactive materials."
<br>§832. Participation in nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats to the United States
<br>
<br>(a) Whoever, within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, willfully participates in or knowingly provides material support or resources (as defined in section 2339A) to a nuclear weapons program or other weapons of mass destruction program of a foreign terrorist power, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years.
<br>
<br>(b) There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.
<br>
<br>(c) Whoever without lawful authority develops, possesses, or attempts or conspires to develop or possess a radiological weapon, or threatens to use or uses a radiological weapon against any person within the United States, or a national of the United States while such national is outside of the United States or against any property that is owned, leased, funded, or used by the United States, whether that property is within or outside of the United States, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
<br>
<br>(d) As used in this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "nuclear weapons program" means a program or plan for the development, acquisition, or production of any nuclear weapon or weapons;
<br>
<br>(2) "weapons of mass destruction program" means a program or plan for the development, acquisition, or production of any weapon or weapons of mass destruction (as defined in section 2332a(c));
<br>
<br>(3) "foreign terrorist power" means a terrorist organization designated under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or a state sponsor of terrorism designated under section 6(j) 1 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; and
<br>
<br>(4) "nuclear weapon" means any weapon that contains or uses nuclear material as defined in section 831(f)(1).1
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 108–458, title VI, §6803(c)(2), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3768.)
