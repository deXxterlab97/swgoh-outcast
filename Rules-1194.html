<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–94, div. J, title VI, §602, Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 3069, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Wildlife trafficking is a major transnational crime that is estimated to generate over $10 billion a year in illegal profits and which is increasingly perpetrated by organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises, including known terrorist organizations.
<br>
<br>"(2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens endangered species worldwide, but also jeopardizes local security, spreads disease, undermines rule of law, fuels corruption, and damages economic development.
<br>
<br>"(3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires a coordinated and sustained approach at the global, regional, national, and local levels.
<br>
<br>"(4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 [16 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.] that it is the policy of the United States to take immediate actions to stop the illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products and associated transnational organized crime.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool in combating sophisticated international crime and that the Department of State and Federal law enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that target wildlife traffickers."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 115–141, div. R, §2, Mar. 23, 2018, 132 Stat. 1123, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Trafficking in persons is a major transnational crime, as recognized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.; division A of Public Law 106–386).
<br>
<br>"(2) Trafficking in persons is increasingly perpetrated by organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises.
<br>
<br>"(3) Combating trafficking in persons requires a global approach to identifying and apprehending the world's worst human trafficking rings.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool in combating sophisticated international crime and that the Department of State and Federal law enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that target human traffickers who prey on the most vulnerable people around the world."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–283, §2, Jan. 15, 2013, 126 Stat. 2492, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Department of State's existing rewards programs permit the payment of reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of—
<br>
<br>"(A) individuals who have committed, or attempted or conspired to commit, certain acts of international terrorism;
<br>
<br>"(B) individuals who have committed, or attempted or conspired to commit, certain narcotics-related offenses; and
<br>
<br>"(C) individuals who have been indicted by certain international criminal tribunals.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Department of State considers the rewards program to be 'one of the most valuable assets the U.S. Government has in the fight against international terrorism'. Since the program's inception in 1984, the United States Government has rewarded over 60 people who provided actionable information that, according to the Department of State, prevented international terrorist attacks or helped convict individuals involved in terrorist attacks.
<br>
<br>"(3) The program has been credited with providing information in several high-profile cases, including the arrest of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein, who United States military forces located and killed in Iraq after receiving information about their locations, and the arrests or deaths of several members of the Abu Sayyaf group, believed to be responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of United States citizens and Filipinos in the Philippines.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the rewards program of the Department of State should be expanded in order to—
<br>
<br>"(1) address the growing threat to important United States interests from transnational criminal activity, such as intellectual property rights piracy, money laundering, trafficking in persons, arms trafficking, and cybercrime; and
<br>
<br>"(2) target other individuals indicted by international, hybrid, or mixed tribunals for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity."

<br>
<br>(F) upon the expiration of the one-year period beginning on the date of death (or after such additional period as may be required for final settlement of the estate), if no claimant shall have appeared, after reasonable public notice and notice to such next of kin as can be ascertained with reasonable diligence, sell or dispose of the residue of the personal estate, except as provided in subparagraph (G), in the same manner as United States Government-owned foreign excess property;

<br>(B) Disposition as surplus United States property
<br>
<br>If, upon the expiration of a period of 5 fiscal years beginning on October 1 after a consular officer takes possession of a personal estate under subsection (a), no legal claimant for such estate has appeared, title to the estate shall be conveyed to the United States, the property in the estate shall be under the custody of the Department of State, and the Secretary shall dispose of the estate in the same manner as surplus United States Government-owned property is disposed or by such means as may be appropriate in light of the nature and value of the property involved. The expenses of sales shall be paid from the estate, and any lawful claim received thereafter shall be payable to the extent of the value of the net proceeds of the estate as a refund from the appropriate Treasury appropriations account.

<br>(B) Treatment as gift
<br>
<br>In the event that the Department requires such property, the Secretary of State shall treat such property as if it were an unconditional gift accepted on behalf of the Department of State under section 2697 of this title and section 300(a)(3) of this title.
