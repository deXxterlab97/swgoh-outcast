<br>§1144a. Clarification of church welfare plan status under State insurance law
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under provisions of a State insurance law described in subsection (b), such a church plan (and any trust under such plan) shall be deemed to be a plan sponsored by a single employer that reimburses costs from general church assets, or purchases insurance coverage with general church assets, or both.
<br>(b) State insurance law
<br>
<br>A State insurance law described in this subsection is a law that—
<br>
<br>(1) requires a church plan, or an organization described in section 414(e)(3)(A) of title 26 and section 1002(33)(C)(i) of this title to the extent that it is administering or funding such a plan, to be licensed; or
<br>
<br>(2) relates solely to the solvency or insolvency of a church plan (including participation in State guaranty funds and associations).
<br>(c) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>(1) Church plan
<br>
<br>The term "church plan" has the meaning given such term by section 414(e) of title 26 and section 1002(33) of this title.
<br>(2) Reimburses costs from general church assets
<br>
<br>The term "reimburses costs from general church assets" means engaging in an activity that is not the spreading of risk solely for the purposes of the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b).
<br>(3) Welfare plan
<br>
<br>The term "welfare plan"—
<br>
<br>(A) means any church plan to the extent that such plan provides medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services; and
<br>
<br>(B) does not include any entity, such as a health insurance issuer described in section 9832(b)(2) of title 26 or a health maintenance organization described in section 9832(b)(3) of title 26, or any other organization that does business with the church plan or organization sponsoring or maintaining such a plan.
<br>(d) Enforcement authority
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for purposes of enforcing provisions of State insurance laws that apply to a church plan that is a welfare plan, the church plan shall be subject to State enforcement as if the church plan were an insurer licensed by the State.
<br>(e) Application of section
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (d), the application of this section is limited to determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b). This section shall not otherwise be construed to recharacterize the status, or modify or affect the rights, of any plan participant or beneficiary, including participants or beneficiaries who make plan contributions.

<br>Findings and Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–92, §2, Nov. 19, 1997, 111 Stat. 2139, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation will severely strain our already overburdened entitlement system, necessitating increased reliance on pension and other personal savings.
<br>
<br>"(2) Studies have found that less than a third of Americans have even tried to calculate how much they will need to have saved by retirement, and that less than 20 percent are very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout their retirement.
<br>
<br>"(3) A leading obstacle to expanding retirement savings is the simple fact that far too many Americans—particularly the young—are either unaware of, or without the knowledge and resources necessary to take advantage of, the extensive benefits offered by our retirement savings system.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note, set out under section 1001 of this title]—
<br>
<br>"(1) to advance the public's knowledge and understanding of retirement savings and its critical importance to the future well-being of American workers and their families;
<br>
<br>"(2) to provide for a periodic, bipartisan national retirement savings summit in conjunction with the White House to elevate the issue of savings to national prominence; and
<br>
<br>"(3) to initiate the development of a broad-based, public education program to encourage and enhance individual commitment to a personal retirement savings strategy."

<br>
<br>(4) to identify the problems workers have in setting aside adequate savings for retirement;
<br>
<br>(5) to identify the barriers which employers, especially small employers, face in assisting their workers in accumulating retirement savings;
<br>
<br>(6) to examine the impact and effectiveness of individual employers to promote personal savings for retirement among their workers and to promote participation in company savings options;
<br>
<br>(7) to examine the impact and effectiveness of government programs at the Federal, State, and local levels to educate the public about, and to encourage, retirement income savings;
<br>
<br>(8) to develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for the legislative and executive branches of the Government and for private sector action as may be appropriate for promoting private pensions and individual retirement savings; and

<br>§1167. Definitions and special rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part—
<br>(1) Group health plan
<br>
<br>The term "group health plan" means an employee welfare benefit plan providing medical care (as defined in section 213(d) of title 26) to participants or beneficiaries directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise. Such term shall not include any plan substantially all of the coverage under which is for qualified long-term care services (as defined in section 7702B(c) of title 26). Such term shall not include any qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement (as defined in section 9831(d)(2) of title 26).
<br>(2) Covered employee
<br>
<br>The term "covered employee" means an individual who is (or was) provided coverage under a group health plan by virtue of the performance of services by the individual for 1 or more persons maintaining the plan (including as an employee defined in section 401(c)(1) of title 26).
<br>(3) Qualified beneficiary
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "qualified beneficiary" means, with respect to a covered employee under a group health plan, any other individual who, on the day before the qualifying event for that employee, is a beneficiary under the plan—
<br>
<br>(i) as the spouse of the covered employee, or
<br>
<br>(ii) as the dependent child of the employee.
<br>
<br>Such term shall also include a child who is born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of continuation coverage under this part.
<br>(B) Special rule for terminations and reduced employment
<br>
<br>In the case of a qualifying event described in section 1163(2) of this title, the term "qualified beneficiary" includes the covered employee.
<br>(C) Special rule for retirees and widows
<br>
<br>In the case of a qualifying event described in section 1163(6) of this title, the term "qualified beneficiary" includes a covered employee who had retired on or before the date of substantial elimination of coverage and any other individual who, on the day before such qualifying event, is a beneficiary under the plan—
<br>
<br>(i) as the spouse of the covered employee,
<br>
<br>(ii) as the dependent child of the employee, or
<br>
<br>(iii) as the surviving spouse of the covered employee.
<br>(4) Employer
<br>
<br>Subsection (n) (relating to leased employees) and subsection (t) (relating to application of controlled group rules to certain employee benefits) of section 414 of title 26 shall apply for purposes of this part in the same manner and to the same extent as such subsections apply for purposes of section 106 of title 26. Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be consistent and coextensive with any regulations prescribed for similar purposes by the Secretary of the Treasury (or such Secretary's delegate) under such subsections.
<br>(5) Optional extension of required periods
<br>
<br>A group health plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this part solely because the plan provides both—
<br>
<br>(A) that the period of extended coverage referred to in section 1162(2) of this title commences with the date of the loss of coverage, and
<br>
<br>(B) that the applicable notice period provided under section 1166(a)(2) of this title commences with the date of the loss of coverage.
