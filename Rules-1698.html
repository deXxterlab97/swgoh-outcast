<br>Any party to a derivation proceeding dissatisfied with the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on the derivation proceeding, may have remedy by civil action, if commenced within such time after such decision, not less than sixty days, as the Director appoints or as provided in section 141, unless he has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and such appeal is pending or has been decided. In such suits the record in the Patent and Trademark Office shall be admitted on motion of either party upon the terms and conditions as to costs, expenses, and the further cross-examination of the witnesses as the court imposes, without prejudice to the right of the parties to take further testimony. The testimony and exhibits of the record in the Patent and Trademark Office when admitted shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in the suit.

<br>Such suit may be instituted against the party in interest as shown by the records of the Patent and Trademark Office at the time of the decision complained of, but any party in interest may become a party to the action.

The Director shall not be a necessary party but he shall be notified of the filing of the suit by the clerk of the court in which it is filed and shall have the right to intervene. Judgment of the court in favor of the right of an applicant to a patent shall authorize the Director to issue such patent on the filing in the Patent and Trademark Office of a certified copy of the judgment and on compliance with the requirements of law.

<br>
<br>(D) The Director shall proceed to grant the patent after completion of the Director's determination of a patent term adjustment under the procedures established under this subsection, notwithstanding any appeal taken by the applicant of such determination.

<br>§156. Extension of patent term
<br>
<br>(a) The term of a patent which claims a product, a method of using a product, or a method of manufacturing a product shall be extended in accordance with this section from the original expiration date of the patent, which shall include any patent term adjustment granted under section 154(b), if—
<br>
<br>(1) the term of the patent has not expired before an application is submitted under subsection (d)(1) for its extension;
<br>
<br>(2) the term of the patent has never been extended under subsection (e)(1) of this section;
<br>
<br>(3) an application for extension is submitted by the owner of record of the patent or its agent and in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (d);
<br>
<br>(4) the product has been subject to a regulatory review period before its commercial marketing or use;
<br>
<br>(5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product under the provision of law under which such regulatory review period occurred;
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a patent which claims a method of manufacturing the product which primarily uses recombinant DNA technology in the manufacture of the product, the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of a product manufactured under the process claimed in the patent; or
<br>
<br>(C) for purposes of subparagraph (A), in the case of a patent which—
<br>
<br>(i) claims a new animal drug or a veterinary biological product which (I) is not covered by the claims in any other patent which has been extended, and (II) has received permission for the commercial marketing or use in non-food-producing animals and in food-producing animals, and
<br>
<br>(ii) was not extended on the basis of the regulatory review period for use in non-food-producing animals,
<br>
<br>the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the drug or product after the regulatory review period for use in food-producing animals is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug or product for administration to a food-producing animal.
<br>
<br>The product referred to in paragraphs (4) and (5) is hereinafter in this section referred to as the "approved product".
<br>
<br>(b) Except as provided in subsection (d)(5)(F), the rights derived from any patent the term of which is extended under this section shall during the period during which the term of the patent is extended—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of a patent which claims a product, be limited to any use approved for the product—
<br>
<br>(A) before the expiration of the term of the patent—
<br>
<br>(i) under the provision of law under which the applicable regulatory review occurred, or
<br>
<br>(ii) under the provision of law under which any regulatory review described in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subsection (g) occurred, and

<br>(A) before the expiration of the term of the patent—
<br>
<br>(i) under any provision of law under which an applicable regulatory review occurred, and
<br>
<br>(ii) under the provision of law under which any regulatory review described in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of subsection (g) occurred, and
<br>
<br>(B) on or after the expiration of the regulatory review period upon which the extension of the patent was based; and
<br>
<br>(3) in the case of a patent which claims a method of manufacturing a product, be limited to the method of manufacturing as used to make—
<br>
<br>(A) the approved product, or

<br>
<br>As used in this subsection, the term "product" includes an approved product.
<br>
<br>(c) The term of a patent eligible for extension under subsection (a) shall be extended by the time equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent is issued, except that—
<br>
<br>(1) each period of the regulatory review period shall be reduced by any period determined under subsection (d)(2)(B) during which the applicant for the patent extension did not act with due diligence during such period of the regulatory review period;
<br>
<br>(2) after any reduction required by paragraph (1), the period of extension shall include only one-half of the time remaining in the periods described in paragraphs (1)(B)(i), (2)(B)(i), (3)(B)(i), (4)(B)(i), and (5)(B)(i) of subsection (g);
<br>
<br>(3) if the period remaining in the term of a patent after the date of the approval of the approved product under the provision of law under which such regulatory review occurred when added to the regulatory review period as revised under paragraphs (1) and (2) exceeds fourteen years, the period of extension shall be reduced so that the total of both such periods does not exceed fourteen years; and
<br>
<br>(4) in no event shall more than one patent be extended under subsection (e)(1) for the same regulatory review period for any product.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) To obtain an extension of the term of a patent under this section, the owner of record of the patent or its agent shall submit an application to the Director.

<br>
<br>of the extension application and shall submit to the Secretary who is so notified a copy of the application.
