<br>If the Secretary determines there is a reasonable probability that a controlled substance would cause serious adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary may, after providing the appropriate person with an opportunity to consult with the agency, issue an order requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors, or pharmacists, who distribute such controlled substance to immediately cease distribution of such controlled substance.
<br>(2) Hearing
<br>
<br>An order under paragraph (1) shall provide the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the date of issuance of the order, on whether adequate evidence exists to justify an amendment to the order, and what actions are required by such amended order pursuant to subparagraph (3).
<br>(3) Order resolution
<br>
<br>After an order is issued according to the process under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall, except as provided in paragraph (4)—
<br>
<br>(A) vacate the order, if the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the actions required by the order;
<br>
<br>(B) continue the order ceasing distribution of the controlled substance until a date specified in such order; or
<br>
<br>(C) amend the order to require a recall of the controlled substance, including any requirements to notify appropriate persons, a timetable for the recall to occur, and a schedule for updates to be provided to the Secretary regarding such recall.
<br>(4) Risk assessment
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that the risk of recalling a controlled substance presents a greater health risk than the health risk of not recalling such controlled substance from use, an amended order under subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall not include either a recall order for, or an order to cease distribution of, such controlled substance, as applicable.
<br>(5) Action following order
<br>
<br>Any person who is subject to an order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall immediately cease distribution of or recall, as applicable, the controlled substance and provide notification as required by such order.
<br>(b) Notice to persons affected
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines necessary, the Secretary may require the person subject to an order pursuant to paragraph (1) or an amended order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) to provide either a notice of a recall order for, or an order to cease distribution of, such controlled substance, as applicable, under this section to appropriate persons, including persons who manufacture, distribute, import, or offer for sale such product that is the subject of an order and to the public. In providing such notice, the Secretary may use the assistance of health professionals who prescribed or dispensed such controlled substances.
<br>(c) Nondelegation
<br>
<br>An order described in subsection (a)(3) shall be ordered by the Secretary or an official designated by the Secretary. An official may not be so designated under this section unless the official is the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or an official senior to such Director.
<br>(d) Savings clause
<br>
<br>Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting—
<br>
<br>(1) the authority of the Secretary to issue an order to cease distribution of, or to recall, any drug under any other provision of this chapter or the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.]; or
<br>
<br>(2) the ability of the Secretary to request any person to perform a voluntary activity related to any drug subject to this chapter or the Public Health Service Act.

<br>Part F—New Animal Drugs for Minor Use and Minor Species
<br>§360ccc. Conditional approval of new animal drugs for minor use and minor species and certain new animal drugs
<br>(a) Application requirements
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (3), any person may file with the Secretary an application for conditional approval of—
<br>
<br>(i) a new animal drug intended for a minor use or a minor species; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a new animal drug not intended for a minor use or minor species—
<br>
<br>(I) that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition or addresses an unmet animal or human health need; and
<br>
<br>(II) for which the Secretary determines that a demonstration of effectiveness would require a complex or particularly difficult study or studies.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall, not later than September 30, 2019, issue guidance or regulations further clarifying the criteria specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>
<br>(C) An application under this paragraph shall comply in all respects with the provisions of section 360b of this title except for subsections (a)(4), (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1), (e), (h), and (n) of such section unless otherwise stated in this section, and any additional provisions of this section.
<br>
<br>(D) New animal drugs for which conditional approval is sought under this section are subject to the same safety standards that would be applied to new animal drugs under section 360b(d) of this title (including, for antimicrobial new animal drugs, with respect to antimicrobial resistance).
<br>
<br>(2) The applicant shall submit to the Secretary as part of an application for the conditional approval of a new animal drug—
<br>
<br>(A) all information necessary to meet the requirements of section 360b(b)(1) of this title except section 360b(b)(1)(A) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe under section 360b(d) of this title (including, for an antimicrobial new animal drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance) and there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness for use;
<br>
<br>(C) data for establishing a conditional dose;
<br>
<br>(D) projections of expected need and the justification for that expectation based on the best information available;
<br>
<br>(E) information regarding the quantity of drug expected to be distributed on an annual basis to meet the expected need; and
<br>
<br>(F) a commitment that the applicant will conduct additional investigations to meet the requirements for the full demonstration of effectiveness under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of this title within 5 years.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) A person may not file an application under paragraph (1) if—
<br>
<br>(i) the application seeks conditional approval of a new animal drug that is contained in, or is a product of, a transgenic animal.1
<br>
<br>(ii) the person has previously filed an application for conditional approval under paragraph (1) for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use whether or not subsequently conditionally approved by the Secretary under subsection (b); or
<br>
<br>(iii) the person obtained the application, or data or other information contained therein, directly or indirectly from the person who filed for conditional approval under paragraph (1) for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use whether or not subsequently conditionally approved by the Secretary under subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(B) A person may not file an application under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the application seeks conditional approval of a new animal drug that contains an antimicrobial active ingredient.
<br>
<br>(4) Beginning on October 1, 2018, all applications or submissions pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted by electronic means in such format as the Secretary may require.
<br>(b) Order of approval or hearing
<br>
<br>Within 180 days after the filing of an application pursuant to subsection (a), or such additional period as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the applicant, the Secretary shall either—
<br>
<br>(1) issue an order, effective for one year, conditionally approving the application if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds for denying conditional approval, specified in subsection (c) of this section applies and publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval, or
<br>
<br>(2) give the applicant notice of an opportunity for an informal hearing on the question whether such application can be conditionally approved.
<br>(c) Order of approval or refusal after hearing
<br>
<br>If the Secretary finds, after giving the applicant notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing, that—
<br>
<br>(1) any of the provisions of section 360b(d)(1)(A) through (D) or (F) through (I) of this title are applicable;
<br>
<br>(2) the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the application and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such drug, is insufficient to show that there is a reasonable expectation that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; or
<br>
<br>(3) another person has received approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use, and that person is able to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended;
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to conditionally approve the application. If, after such notice and opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary finds that paragraphs (1) through (3) do not apply, the Secretary shall issue an order conditionally approving the application effective for one year and publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval. Any order issued under this subsection refusing to conditionally approve an application shall state the findings upon which it is based.
<br>(d) Effective period; renewal; refusal of renewal
<br>
<br>A conditional approval under this section is effective for a 1-year period and is thereafter renewable by the Secretary annually for up to 4 additional 1-year terms. A conditional approval shall be in effect for no more than 5 years from the date of approval under subsection (b)(1) or (c) of this section unless extended as provided for in subsection (h) of this section. The following shall also apply:
<br>
<br>(1) No later than 90 days from the end of the 1-year period for which the original or renewed conditional approval is effective, the applicant may submit a request to renew a conditional approval for an additional 1-year term.
<br>
<br>(2) A conditional approval shall be deemed renewed at the end of the 1-year period, or at the end of a 90-day extension that the Secretary may, at the Secretary's discretion, grant by letter in order to complete review of the renewal request, unless the Secretary determines before the expiration of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension that—
<br>
<br>(A) the applicant failed to submit a timely renewal request;
<br>
<br>(B) the request fails to contain sufficient information to show that—
<br>
<br>(i) the applicant is making sufficient progress toward meeting approval requirements under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of this title, and is likely to be able to fulfill those requirements and obtain an approval under section 360b of this title before the expiration of the 5-year maximum term of the conditional approval;
<br>
<br>(ii) the quantity of the drug that has been distributed is consistent with the conditionally approved intended use and conditions of use, unless there is adequate explanation that ensures that the drug is only used for its intended purpose; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has not received approval under section 360b of this title, or if such a drug has been approved, that the holder of the approved application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended; or
<br>
<br>(C) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable.
<br>
<br>(3) If the Secretary determines before the end of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension, if granted, that a conditional approval should not be renewed, the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to renew the conditional approval, and such conditional approval shall be deemed withdrawn and no longer in effect. The Secretary shall thereafter provide an opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant on the issue whether the conditional approval shall be reinstated.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) In the case of an application under subsection (a) with respect to a drug for which the Secretary provides notice to the sponsor that the Secretary intends to issue a scientific and medical evaluation and recommend controls under the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], conditional approval of such application shall not take effect until the interim final rule controlling the drug is issued in accordance with section 201(j) of the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 811(j)].
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this section, with respect to an application described in subparagraph (A), the term "date of approval" shall mean the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date an application under subsection (a) is conditionally approved under subsection (b); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the date of issuance of the interim final rule controlling the drug.
<br>(e) Withdrawal of conditional approval
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) if the Secretary finds that another person has received approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use and that person is able to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall, after due notice and opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) if the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable; or
<br>
<br>(B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary with respect to such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the application was conditionally approved, that there is not a reasonable expectation that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may also, after due notice and opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant, issue an order withdrawing conditional approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (a) if the Secretary finds that any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(2) of this title are applicable.
<br>(f) Labeling
<br>
<br>(1) The label and labeling of a new animal drug with a conditional approval under this section shall for the conditionally approved use—
<br>
<br>(A) bear the statement, "conditionally approved by FDA pending a full demonstration of effectiveness under application number"; and
<br>
<br>(B) contain such other information as prescribed by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall, through regulation or guidance, determine under what conditions an intended use that is the subject of a conditional approval under this section may be included in the same product label with any intended use approved under section 360b of this title.
<br>(g) Amendment of application
<br>
<br>A conditionally approved new animal drug application may not be amended or supplemented to add indications for use.
<br>(h) Order of approval after conditional approval period termination
<br>
<br>180 days prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, an applicant shall have submitted all the information necessary to support a complete new animal drug application in accordance with section 360b(b)(1) of this title or the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect. Following review of this information, the Secretary shall either—
<br>
<br>(1) issue an order approving the application under section 360b(c) of this title if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds for denying approval specified in section 360b(d)(1) of this title applies, or
<br>
<br>(2) give the applicant an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary under section 360b(d) of this title on the question whether such application can be approved.
<br>
<br>Upon issuance of an order approving the application, product labeling and administrative records of approval shall be modified accordingly. If the Secretary has not issued an order under section 360b(c) of this title approving such application prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect unless the Secretary grants an extension of an additional 180-day period so that the Secretary can complete review of the application. The decision to grant an extension is committed to the discretion of the Secretary and not subject to judicial review.
<br>(i) Judicial review
<br>
<br>The decision of the Secretary under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section refusing or withdrawing conditional approval of an application shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>(j) Definition
<br>
<br>In this section and section 360ccc–1 of this title, the term "transgenic animal" means an animal whose genome contains a nucleotide sequence that has been intentionally modified in vitro, and the progeny of such an animal; Provided that the term "transgenic animal" does not include an animal of which the nucleotide sequence of the genome has been modified solely by selective breeding.
<br>(k) Sunset
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary's authority to grant conditional approval of new animal drugs not intended for a minor use or minor species pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) terminates on October 1, 2028.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) may not accept any new applications for such conditional approval pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii) on or after such date; and
<br>
<br>(B) may continue all activities under this section with respect to drugs that were conditionally approved pursuant to 2 (a)(1)(A)(ii) prior to such date.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may, until October 1, 2032, accept applications for approval under 3 360b of this title of drugs conditionally approved pursuant to 2 (a)(1)(A)(ii).

<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2018—Pub. L. 115–234, §304(a)(1), substituted "species and certain new animal drugs" for "species" in section catchline.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 115–234, §304(a)(2)(A), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: "Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this section, any person may file with the Secretary an application for conditional approval of a new animal drug intended for a minor use or a minor species. Such an application may not be a supplement to an application approved under section 360b of this title. Such application must comply in all respects with the provisions of section 360b of this title except sections 360b(a)(4), 360b(b)(2), 360b(c)(1), 360b(c)(2), 360b(c)(3), 360b(d)(1), 360b(e), 360b(h), and 360b(n) of this title unless otherwise stated in this section, and any additional provisions of this section. New animal drugs are subject to application of the same safety standards that would be applied to such drugs under section 360b(d) of this title (including, for antimicrobial new animal drugs, with respect to antimicrobial resistance)."
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a)(3). Pub. L. 115–234, §304(a)(2)(B), designated existing provisions as subpar. (A), redesignated former subpars. (A) to (C) as cls. (i) to (iii), respectively, of subpar. (A), and added subpar. (B).

<br>
<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–282, title I, §102(a), Aug. 2, 2004, 118 Stat. 891, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs for use in minor species.
<br>
<br>"(2) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur infrequently or in limited geographic areas.
<br>
<br>"(3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins involved, and capital investment required, it is generally not economically feasible for new animal drug applicants to pursue approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.
<br>
<br>"(4) Because the populations for which such new animal drugs are intended may be small and conditions of animal management may vary widely, it is often difficult to design and conduct studies to establish drug safety and effectiveness under traditional new animal drug approval processes.
<br>
<br>"(5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of animal welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the lawful use and marketing of certain new animal drugs for minor species and minor uses that take into account these special circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not endanger animal or public health.
<br>
<br>"(6) Exclusive marketing rights for clinical testing expenses have helped encourage the development of 'orphan' drugs for human use, and comparable incentives should encourage the development of new animal drugs for minor species and minor uses."
<br>Regulations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–282, title I, §102(b)(6), Aug. 2, 2004, 118 Stat. 905, provided that: "On the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 2, 2004], the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall implement sections 571 and 573 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 360ccc, 360ccc–2] and subsequently publish implementing regulations. Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to implement section 573 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by this Act), and not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations implementing section 573 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to implement section 572 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by this Act) [21 U.S.C. 360ccc–1], and not later than 36 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations implementing section 572 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Not later than 30 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to implement section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by this Act), and not later than 42 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations implementing section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These timeframes shall be extended by 12 months for each fiscal year, in which the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (i) [no subsection (i) of section 102 has been enacted] are not in fact appropriated."

<br>
<br>3 So in original. The word "section" probably should appear.
<br>§360ccc–1. Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor species
<br>(a) Establishment and content
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall establish an index limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) new animal drugs intended for use in a minor species for which there is a reasonable certainty that the animal or edible products from the animal will not be consumed by humans or food-producing animals; and
<br>
<br>(B) new animal drugs intended for use only in a hatchery, tank, pond, or other similar contained man-made structure in an early, non-food life stage of a food-producing minor species, where safety for humans is demonstrated in accordance with the standard of section 360b(d) of this title (including, for an antimicrobial new animal drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance).
<br>
<br>(2) The index shall not include a new animal drug that is contained in or a product of a transgenic animal.
<br>(b) Conferences
<br>
<br>Any person intending to file a request under this section shall be entitled to one or more conferences to discuss the requirements for indexing a new animal drug.
<br>(c) Request for determination of eligibility for inclusion in index
<br>
<br>(1) Any person may submit a request to the Secretary for a determination whether a new animal drug may be eligible for inclusion in the index. Such a request shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) information regarding the need for the new animal drug, the species for which the new animal drug is intended, the proposed intended use and conditions of use, and anticipated annual distribution;
<br>
<br>(B) information to support the conclusion that the proposed use meets the conditions of subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section;
<br>
<br>(C) information regarding the components and composition of the new animal drug;
<br>
<br>(D) a description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such new animal drug;
<br>
<br>(E) an environmental assessment that meets the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.], as amended, and as defined in 21 CFR Part 25, as it appears on August 2, 2004, and amended thereafter or information to support a categorical exclusion from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment;
<br>
<br>(F) information sufficient to support the conclusion that the proposed use of the new animal drug is safe under section 360b(d) of this title with respect to individuals exposed to the new animal drug through its manufacture or use; and
<br>
<br>(G) such other information as the Secretary may deem necessary to make this eligibility determination.
<br>
<br>(2) Within 90 days after the submission of a request for a determination of eligibility for indexing based on subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, or 180 days for a request submitted based on subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall grant or deny the request, and notify the person who requested such determination of the Secretary's decision. The Secretary shall grant the request if the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use is not approved or conditionally approved;
<br>
<br>(B) the proposed use of the drug meets the conditions of subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1), as appropriate;
<br>
<br>(C) the person requesting the determination has established appropriate specifications for the manufacture and control of the new animal drug and has demonstrated an understanding of the requirements of current good manufacturing practices;
<br>
<br>(D) the new animal drug will not significantly affect the human environment; and
<br>
<br>(E) the new animal drug is safe with respect to individuals exposed to the new animal drug through its manufacture or use.
<br>
<br>If the Secretary denies the request, the Secretary shall thereafter provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference. A decision of the Secretary to deny an eligibility request following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>(d) Request for addition to index
<br>
<br>(1) With respect to a new animal drug for which the Secretary has made a determination of eligibility under subsection (c), the person who made such a request may ask that the Secretary add the new animal drug to the index established under subsection (a). The request for addition to the index shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) a copy of the Secretary's determination of eligibility issued under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(B) a written report that meets the requirements in subsection (d)(2) of this section;
<br>
<br>(C) a proposed index entry;
<br>
<br>(D) facsimile labeling;
<br>
<br>(E) anticipated annual distribution of the new animal drug;
<br>
<br>(F) a written commitment to manufacture the new animal drug and animal feeds bearing or containing such new animal drug according to current good manufacturing practices;
<br>
<br>(G) a written commitment to label, distribute, and promote the new animal drug only in accordance with the index entry;
<br>
<br>(H) upon specific request of the Secretary, information submitted to the expert panel described in paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(I) any additional requirements that the Secretary may prescribe by general regulation or specific order.
<br>
<br>(2) The report required in paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be authored by a qualified expert panel;
<br>
<br>(B) include an evaluation of all available target animal safety and effectiveness information, including anecdotal information;
<br>
<br>(C) state the expert panel's opinion regarding whether the benefits of using the new animal drug for the proposed use in a minor species outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm being caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally approved new animal drug for the minor species in question;
<br>
<br>(D) include information from which labeling can be written; and
<br>
<br>(E) include a recommendation regarding whether the new animal drug should be limited to use under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
<br>
<br>(3) A qualified expert panel, as used in this section, is a panel that—
<br>
<br>(A) is composed of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the target animal safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug under consideration;
<br>
<br>(B) operates external to FDA; and
<br>
<br>(C) is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall define the criteria for selection of a qualified expert panel and the procedures for the operation of the panel by regulation.
<br>
<br>(4) Within 180 days after the receipt of a request for listing a new animal drug in the index, the Secretary shall grant or deny the request. The Secretary shall grant the request if the request for indexing continues to meet the eligibility criteria in subsection (a) and the Secretary finds, on the basis of the report of the qualified expert panel and other information available to the Secretary, that the benefits of using the new animal drug for the proposed use in a minor species outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved new animal drug for the minor species in question. If the Secretary denies the request, the Secretary shall thereafter provide due notice and the opportunity for an informal conference. The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>(e) Index contents; publication
<br>
<br>(1) The index established under subsection (a) shall include the following information for each listed drug—
<br>
<br>(A) the name and address of the person who holds the index listing;
<br>
<br>(B) the name of the drug and the intended use and conditions of use for which it is being indexed;
<br>
<br>(C) product labeling; and
<br>
<br>(D) conditions and any limitations that the Secretary deems necessary regarding use of the drug.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall publish the index, and revise it periodically.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may establish by regulation a process for reporting changes in the conditions of manufacturing or labeling of indexed products.
<br>(f) Removal from index; suspended listing
<br>
<br>(1) If the Secretary finds, after due notice to the person who requested the index listing and an opportunity for an informal conference, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the expert panel failed to meet the requirements as set forth by the Secretary by regulation;
<br>
<br>(B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal;
<br>
<br>(C) the conditions of subsection (c)(2) of this section are no longer satisfied;
<br>
<br>(D) the manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with current good manufacturing practices;
<br>
<br>(E) the labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug is not in accordance with the index entry;
<br>
<br>(F) the conditions and limitations of use associated with the index listing have not been followed; or
<br>
<br>(G) the request for indexing contains any untrue statement of material fact,
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall remove the new animal drug from the index. The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that the use of the drug would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals, the Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(A) suspend the listing of such drug immediately;
<br>
<br>(B) give the person listed in the index prompt notice of the Secretary's action; and
<br>
<br>(C) afford that person the opportunity for an informal conference.
<br>
<br>The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>(g) Regulations concerning exemptions for investigational use
<br>
<br>For purposes of indexing new animal drugs under this section, to the extent consistent with the public health, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations for exempting from the operation of section 360b of this title minor species new animal drugs and animal feeds bearing or containing new animal drugs intended solely for investigational use by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to investigate the safety and effectiveness of minor species animal drugs. Such regulations may, at the discretion of the Secretary, among other conditions relating to the protection of the public health, provide for conditioning such exemption upon the establishment and maintenance of such records, and the making of such reports to the Secretary, by the manufacturer or the sponsor of the investigation of such article, of data (including but not limited to analytical reports by investigators) obtained as a result of such investigational use of such article, as the Secretary finds will enable the Secretary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such article in the event of the filing of a request for an index listing pursuant to this section.
<br>(h) Labeling contents
<br>
<br>The labeling of a new animal drug that is the subject of an index listing shall state, prominently and conspicuously—
<br>
<br>(1) "LEGAL STATUS—In order to be legally marketed, a new animal drug intended for a minor species must be Approved, Conditionally Approved, or Indexed by the Food and Drug Administration. THIS PRODUCT IS INDEXED—MIF #" (followed by the applicable minor species index file number and a period) "Extra-label use is prohibited.";
<br>
<br>(2) except in the case of new animal drugs indexed for use in an early life stage of a food-producing animal, "This product is not to be used in animals intended for use as food for humans or food-producing animals."; and
