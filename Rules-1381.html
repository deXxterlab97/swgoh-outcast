<br>
<br>(2) may give priority to the acquisition of fractional interests representing 2 percent or less of a parcel of trust or restricted land, especially those interests that would have escheated to a tribe but for the Supreme Court's decision in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S 1 Ct. 727 (1997));
<br>
<br>(3) to the extent practicable—
<br>
<br>(A) shall consult with the tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over the land involved in determining which tracts to acquire on a reservation;
<br>
<br>(B) shall coordinate the acquisition activities with the acquisition program of the tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over the land involved, including a tribal land consolidation plan approved pursuant to section 2203 of this title; and

<br>
<br>(4) shall minimize the administrative costs associated with the land acquisition program through the use of policies and procedures designed to accommodate the voluntary sale of interests under this section, notwithstanding the existence of any otherwise applicable policy, procedure, or regulation, through the elimination of duplicate—
<br>
<br>(A) conveyance documents;
<br>
<br>(B) administrative proceedings; and
<br>
<br>(C) transactions.
<br>(c) Sale of interest to Indian landowners
<br>(1) Conveyance at request

<br>
<br>(i) on payment by the Indian landowner of the amount paid for the interest by the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if—
<br>
<br>(I) the Indian referred to in this subparagraph provides assurances that the purchase price will be paid by pledging revenue from any source, including trust resources; and
<br>
<br>(II) the Secretary determines that the purchase price will be paid in a timely and efficient manner.
<br>(B) Limitation
<br>
<br>With respect to a conveyance under this subsection, the Secretary shall not approve an application to terminate the trust status or remove the restrictions of such an interest unless the interest is subject to a foreclosure of a mortgage in accordance with section 5135 of this title.

<br>
<br>There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $95,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, and $145,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2010.

<br>§2213. Administration of acquired fractional interests; disposition of proceeds
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the conditions described in subsection (b)(1), an Indian tribe receiving a fractional interest under section 2212 of this title may, as a tenant in common with the other owners of the trust or restricted lands, lease the interest, sell the resources, consent to the granting of rights-of-way, or engage in any other transaction affecting the trust or restricted land authorized by law.
<br>(b) Application of revenue from acquired interests to land consolidation program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall have a lien on any revenue accruing to an interest described in subsection (a) until the Secretary provides for the removal of the lien under paragraph (3), (4), or (5).
<br>(2) Requirements
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Until the Secretary removes a lien from an interest in land under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(i) any lease, resource sale contract, right-of-way, or other document evidencing a transaction affecting the interest shall contain a clause providing that all revenue derived from the interest shall be paid to the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any revenue derived from any interest acquired by the Secretary in accordance with section 2212 of this title shall be deposited in the fund created under section 2215 of this title.
<br>(B) Approval of transactions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 5123 of this title, or any other provision of law, until the Secretary removes a lien from an interest in land under paragraph (1), the Secretary may approve a transaction covered under this section on behalf of an Indian tribe.
<br>(3) Removal of liens after findings
<br>
<br>The Secretary may remove a lien referred to in paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes a finding that—
<br>
<br>(A) the costs of administering the interest from which revenue accrues under the lien will equal or exceed the projected revenues for the parcel of land involved;
<br>
<br>(B) in the discretion of the Secretary, it will take an unreasonable period of time for the parcel of land to generate revenue that equals the purchase price paid for the interest; or
<br>
<br>(C) a subsequent decrease in the value of land or commodities associated with the parcel of land make it likely that the interest will be unable to generate revenue that equals the purchase price paid for the interest in a reasonable time.
<br>(4) Removal of liens upon payment into the acquisition fund
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall remove a lien referred to in paragraph (1) upon payment of an amount equal to the purchase price of that interest in land into the Acquisition Fund created under section 2215 1 of this title, except where the tribe with jurisdiction over such interest in land authorizes the Secretary to continue the lien in order to generate additional acquisition funds.
<br>(5) Other removal of liens
<br>
<br>The Secretary may, in consultation with tribal governments and other entities described in section 2212(b)(3) of this title, periodically remove liens referred to in paragraph (1) from interests in land acquired by the Secretary.
<br>(c) Tribe not treated as party to lease; no effect on tribal sovereignty, immunity
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to any undivided interest in allotted land held by the Secretary in trust for a tribe if a lease or agreement under subsection (a) is otherwise applicable to such undivided interest by reason of this section even though the Indian tribe did not consent to the lease or agreement.
<br>(2) Application of lease
<br>
<br>The lease or agreement described in paragraph (1) shall apply to the portion of the undivided interest in allotted land described in such paragraph (including entitlement of the Indian tribe to payment under the lease or agreement), and the Indian tribe shall not be treated as being a party to the lease or agreement. Nothing in this section (or in the lease or agreement) shall be construed to affect the sovereignty of the Indian tribe.

<br>
<br>(ii) to an Indian co-owner or to the tribe with jurisdiction over the subject parcel of land, where the grantor owns a fractional interest that represents 5 percent or less of the parcel.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>For a period of 5 years after the Secretary approves a conveyance pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not approve an application to terminate the trust status or remove the restrictions of such an interest.

Upon such a request, the Secretary shall forthwith take such interest into trust.

<br>
<br>(A) to match any offer contained in the application; or
<br>
<br>(B) in a case in which there is no purchase price offered, to acquire the interest in the parcel by paying the fair market value of the interest.
<br>(2) Exception for family farms
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a parcel of, or interest in, trust or restricted land that is part of a family farm that is conveyed to a member of the family of a landowner (as defined in section 2205(c)(2)(A)(iv) of this title) if the conveyance requires that in the event that the parcel or interest is offered for sale to an entity or person that is not a member of the family of the landowner, the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase the interest pursuant to paragraph (1).

<br>(1) Percentage interest
<br>
<br>The applicable percentage referred to in subsection (a)(1) shall be determined as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) If there are 5 or fewer owners of the undivided interest in the allotted land, the applicable percentage shall be 90 percent.
<br>
<br>(B) If there are more than 5 such owners, but fewer than 11 such owners, the applicable percentage shall be 80 percent.
<br>

<br>For purposes of this subsection, in determining the number of owners of, and their interests in, the undivided interest in the allotted land with respect to a lease or agreement, the Secretary shall make such determination based on the records of the Department of the Interior that identify the owners of such lands and their interests and the number of owners of such land on the date on which the lease or agreement involved is submitted to the Secretary under this section.
<br>(B) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to treat an Indian tribe as the owner of an interest in allotted land that did not escheat to the tribe pursuant to section 2206 of this title as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S 1 Ct. 727 (1997)).
<br>(c) Authority of Secretary to sign lease or agreement on behalf of certain owners
<br>
<br>The Secretary may give written consent to a lease or agreement under subsection (a)—

<br>(d) Effect of approval
<br>(1) Application to all parties
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), a lease or agreement approved by the Secretary under subsection (a) shall be binding on the parties described in subparagraph (B), to the same extent as if all of the owners of the undivided interest in allotted land covered under the lease or agreement consented to the lease or agreement.
<br>(B) Description of parties
<br>
<br>The parties referred to in subparagraph (A) are—
<br>
<br>(i) the owners of the undivided interest in the allotted land covered under the lease or agreement referred to in such subparagraph; and

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (B) shall apply with respect to any undivided interest in allotted land held by the Secretary in trust for a tribe if a lease or agreement under subsection (a) is otherwise applicable to such undivided interest by reason of this section even though the Indian tribe did not consent to the lease or agreement.
<br>(B) Application of lease
<br>
<br>The lease or agreement described in subparagraph (A) shall apply to the portion of the undivided interest in allotted land described in such paragraph (including entitlement of the Indian tribe to payment under the lease or agreement), and the Indian tribe shall not be treated as being a party to the lease or agreement. Nothing in this section (or in the lease or agreement) shall be construed to affect the sovereignty of the Indian tribe.
<br>(e) Distribution of proceeds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The proceeds derived from a lease or agreement that is approved by the Secretary under subsection (a) shall be distributed to all owners of undivided interest in the allotted land covered under the lease or agreement.

<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to amend or modify the provisions of Public Law 105–188 (25 U.S.C. 396 note), the American Indian Agricultural Resources Management Act (25 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), title II of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, or any other Act that provides specific standards for the percentage of ownership interest that must approve a lease or agreement on a specified reservation.

<br>
<br>(1) numerous academic and governmental organizations have studied the nature and extent of fractionated ownership of Indian land outside of Alaska and have proposed solutions to this problem; and

<br>§2220. Owner-managed interests
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to provide a means for the owner or co-owners of trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land to enter into surface leases of such parcel for certain purposes without approval of the Secretary.
<br>(b) Mineral interests
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the application of any Federal law requiring the Secretary to approve mineral leases or other agreements for the development of the mineral interest in trust or restricted land.
<br>(c) Owner management
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of Federal law requiring the Secretary to approve individual Indian leases of individual Indian trust or restricted land, where the owners of all of the undivided trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have submitted applications to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a), and the Secretary has approved such applications under subsection (d), such owners may, without further approval by the Secretary, enter into a lease of the parcel for agricultural purposes for a term not to exceed 10 years.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>No such lease shall be effective until it has been executed by the owners of all undivided trust or restricted interests in the parcel.
<br>(d) Approval of applications for owner management
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall approve an application for owner management submitted by a qualified applicant pursuant to this section unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the applicant is submitting the application as the result of fraud or undue influence. No such application shall be valid or considered if it is received by the Secretary prior to the date that is 1 year after the date on which notice is published pursuant to section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004.
<br>(2) Commencement of owner-managed status
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the approval of 1 or more applications pursuant to paragraph (1), no trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land shall acquire owner-managed status until applications for all of the trust or restricted interests in such parcel of land have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary pursuant to this section.
<br>(e) Validity of leases
<br>
<br>No lease of trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land that is owner-managed under this section shall be valid or enforceable against the owners of such interests, or against the land, the interest or the United States, unless such lease—
<br>
<br>(1) is consistent with, and entered into in accordance with, the requirements of this section; or
<br>
<br>(2) has been approved by the Secretary in accordance with other Federal laws applicable to the leasing of trust or restricted land.
<br>(f) Lease revenues
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not be responsible for the collection of, or accounting for, any lease revenues accruing to any interests under a lease authorized by subsection (e), so long as such interest is in owner-managed status under the provisions of this section.
<br>(g) Jurisdiction
<br>(1) Jurisdiction unaffected by status
<br>
<br>The Indian tribe with jurisdiction over an interest in trust or restricted land that becomes owner-managed pursuant to this section shall continue to have jurisdiction over the interest to the same extent and in all respects that such tribe had prior to the interest acquiring owner-managed status.
<br>(2) Persons using land
<br>
<br>Any person holding, leasing, or otherwise using such interest in land shall be considered to consent to the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe referred to in paragraph (1), including such tribe's laws and regulations, if any, relating to the use, and any effects associated with the use, of the interest.
<br>(h) Continuation of owner-managed status; revocation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), after the applications of the owners of all of the trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have been approved by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (d), each such interest shall continue in owner-managed status under this section notwithstanding any subsequent conveyance of the interest in trust or restricted status to another person or the subsequent descent of the interest in trust or restricted status by testate or intestate succession to 1 or more heirs.
<br>(2) Revocation
<br>
<br>Owner-managed status of an interest may be revoked upon written request of the owners (including the parents or legal guardians of minors or incompetent owners) of all trust or restricted interests in the parcel, submitted to the Secretary in accordance with regulations adopted under subsection (l).1 The revocation shall become effective as of the date on which the last of all such requests has been delivered to the Secretary.
<br>(3) Effect of revocation
<br>
<br>Revocation of owner-managed status under paragraph (2) shall not affect the validity of any lease made in accordance with the provisions of this section prior to the effective date of the revocation, provided that, after such revocation becomes effective, the Secretary shall be responsible for the collection of, and accounting for, all future lease revenues accruing to the trust or restricted interests in the parcel from and after such effective date.
<br>(i) Defined terms
<br>
<br>(1) For purposes of subsection (d)(1), the term "qualified applicant" means—
<br>
<br>(A) a person over the age of 18 who owns a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land; and
<br>
<br>(B) the parent or legal guardian of a minor or incompetent person who owns a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section, the term "owner-managed status" means, with respect to a trust or restricted interest, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the interest is a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land for which applications covering all trust or restricted interests in such parcel have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (d);
<br>
<br>(B) the interest may be leased without approval of the Secretary pursuant to, and in a manner that is consistent with, the requirements of this section; and
<br>
<br>(C) no revocation has occurred under subsection (h)(2).
<br>(j) Secretarial approval of other transactions
<br>
<br>Except with respect to the specific lease transaction described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c), interests that acquire owner-managed status under the provisions of this section shall continue to be subject to all Federal laws requiring the Secretary to approve transactions involving trust or restricted land (including leases with terms of a duration in excess of 10 years) that would otherwise apply to such interests if the interests had not acquired owner-managed status under this section.
<br>(k) Effect of section
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (c), (f), and (h), nothing in this section diminishes or otherwise affects any authority or responsibility of the Secretary with respect to an interest in trust or restricted land.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–459, title II, §221, as added Pub. L. 108–374, §5, Oct. 27, 2004, 118 Stat. 1795; amended Pub. L. 110–453, title II, §207(e), Dec. 2, 2008, 122 Stat. 5033.)

<br>§2401. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Federal Government has a historical relationship and unique legal and moral responsibility to Indian tribes and their members,
<br>
<br>(2) included in this responsibility is the treaty, statutory, and historical obligation to assist the Indian tribes in meeting the health and social needs of their members,
<br>
<br>(3) alcoholism and alcohol and substance abuse is the most severe health and social problem facing Indian tribes and people today and nothing is more costly to Indian people than the consequences of alcohol and substance abuse measured in physical, mental, social, and economic terms,
<br>
<br>(4) alcohol and substance abuse is the leading generic risk factor among Indians, and Indians die from alcoholism at over 4 times the age-adjusted rates for the United States population and alcohol and substance misuse results in a rate of years of potential life lost nearly 5 times that of the United States,
<br>
<br>(5) 4 of the top 10 causes of death among Indians are alcohol and drug related injuries (18 percent of all deaths), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (5 percent), suicide (3 percent), and homicide (3 percent),
<br>
<br>(6) primarily because deaths from unintentional injuries and violence occur disproportionately among young people, the age-specific death rate for Indians is approximately double the United States rate for the 15 to 45 age group,
<br>
<br>(7) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are more than 2 times as likely to commit suicide as the general population and approximately 80 percent of those suicides are alcohol-related,
<br>
<br>(8) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are twice as likely as the general population to die in automobile accidents, 75 percent of which are alcohol-related,
<br>
<br>(9) the Indian Health Service, which is charged with treatment and rehabilitation efforts, has directed only 1 percent of its budget for alcohol and substance abuse problems,
<br>
<br>(10) the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has responsibility for programs in education, social services, law enforcement, and other areas, has assumed little responsibility for coordinating its various efforts to focus on the epidemic of alcohol and substance abuse among Indian people,
<br>
<br>(11) this lack of emphasis and priority continues despite the fact that Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials publicly acknowledge that alcohol and substance abuse among Indians is the most serious health and social problem facing the Indian people, and
<br>
<br>(12) the Indian tribes have the primary responsibility for protecting and ensuring the well-being of their members and the resources made available under this chapter will assist Indian tribes in meeting that responsibility.
