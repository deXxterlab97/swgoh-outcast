<br>
<br>(B) the Commission determines that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by treating the station as a qualifying low-power television station for purposes of this section, or for other reasons determined by the Commission.
<br>(3) Common ownership
<br>
<br>No low-power television station authorized as of November 29, 1999, shall be disqualified for a class A license based on common ownership with any other medium of mass communication.
<br>(4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services to television translator stations and qualifying low-power television stations
<br>
<br>The Commission is not required to issue any additional license for advanced television services to the licensee of a class A television station under this subsection, or to any licensee of any television translator station, but shall accept a license application for such services proposing facilities that will not cause interference to the service area of any other broadcast facility applied for, protected, permitted, or authorized on the date of filing of the advanced television application. Such new license or the original license of the applicant shall be forfeited after the end of the digital television service transition period, as determined by the Commission. A licensee of a low-power television station or television translator station may, at the option of licensee, elect to convert to the provision of advanced television services on its analog channel, but shall not be required to convert to digital operation until the end of such transition period.
<br>(5) No preemption of section 337

<br>Nothing in this subsection preempts or otherwise affects section 337 of this title.
<br>(6) Interim qualification
<br>(A) Stations operating within certain bandwidth
<br>
<br>The Commission may not grant a class A license to a low-power television station for operation between 698 and 806 megahertz, but the Commission shall provide to low-power television stations assigned to and temporarily operating in that bandwidth the opportunity to meet the qualification requirements for a class A license. If such a qualified applicant for a class A license is assigned a channel within the core spectrum (as such term is defined in MM Docket No. 87–286, February 17, 1998), the Commission shall issue a class A license simultaneously with the assignment of such channel.
<br>(B) Certain channels off-limits
<br>
<br>The Commission may not grant under this subsection a class A license to a low-power television station operating on a channel within the core spectrum that includes any of the 175 additional channels referenced in paragraph 45 of its February 23, 1998, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of the Sixth Report and Order (MM Docket No. 87–268). Within 18 months after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall identify by channel, location, and applicable technical parameters those 175 channels.
<br>(7) No interference requirement
<br>
<br>The Commission may not grant a class A license, nor approve a modification of a class A license, unless the applicant or licensee shows that the class A station for which the license or modification is sought will not cause—
<br>
<br>(A) interference within—
<br>
<br>(i) the predicted Grade B contour (as of the date of the enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 [November 29, 1999], or November 1, 1999, whichever is later, or as proposed in a change application filed on or before such date) of any television station transmitting in analog format; or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) the digital television service areas provided in the DTV Table of Allotments; (II) the areas protected in the Commission's digital television regulations (47 CFR 73.622(e) and (f)); (III) the digital television service areas of stations subsequently granted by the Commission prior to the filing of a class A application; and (IV) stations seeking to maximize power under the Commission's rules, if such station has complied with the notification requirements in paragraph (1)(D);
<br>
<br>(B) interference within the protected contour of any low-power television station or low-power television translator station that—
<br>
<br>(i) was licensed prior to the date on which the application for a class A license, or for the modification of such a license, was filed;
<br>
<br>(ii) was authorized by construction permit prior to such date; or
<br>
<br>(iii) had a pending application that was submitted prior to such date; or
<br>
<br>(C) interference within the protected contour of 80 miles from the geographic center of the areas listed in section 22.625(b)(1) or 90.303 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 22.625(b)(1) and 90.303) for frequencies in—
<br>
<br>(i) the 470–512 megahertz band identified in section 22.621 or 90.303 of such regulations; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the 482–488 megahertz band in New York.
<br>(8) Priority for displaced low-power stations
<br>
<br>Low-power stations that are displaced by an application filed under this section shall have priority over other low-power stations in the assignment of available channels.
<br>(g) Evaluation
<br>
<br>Within 10 years after the date the Commission first issues additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission shall conduct an evaluation of the advanced television services program. Such evaluation shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) an assessment of the willingness of consumers to purchase the television receivers necessary to receive broadcasts of advanced television services;
<br>
<br>(2) an assessment of alternative uses, including public safety use, of the frequencies used for such broadcasts; and
<br>
<br>(3) the extent to which the Commission has been or will be able to reduce the amount of spectrum assigned to licensees.
<br>(h) Provision of digital data service by low-power television stations
<br>
<br>(1) Within 60 days after receiving a request (made in such form and manner and containing such information as the Commission may require) under this subsection from a low-power television station to which this subsection applies, the Commission shall authorize the licensee or permittee of that station to provide digital data service subject to the requirements of this subsection as a pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of using low-power television stations to provide high-speed wireless digital data service, including Internet access to unserved areas.

<br>
<br>"(1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, a small number of license holders have operated their stations in a manner beneficial to the public good providing broadcasting to their communities that would not otherwise be available.
<br>
<br>"(2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their stations in a manner consistent with the programming objectives and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters providing worthwhile services to their respective communities while under severe license limitations compared to their full-power counterparts.
<br>
<br>"(3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature of the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from having access to capital, and have severely hampered their ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, programming, or improvements.
<br>
<br>"(4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [Pub. L. 104–104, see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 609 of this title] has added to the uncertainty of the future status of these stations by the lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of their licenses, or their treatment during the transition to high definition, digital television.
<br>
<br>"(5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in television programming such as that currently provided by low-power television stations to foreign-language communities."

<br>
<br>Upon application by an entity seeking to provide public safety services, the Commission shall waive any requirement of this chapter or its regulations implementing this chapter (other than its regulations regarding harmful interference) to the extent necessary to permit the use of unassigned frequencies for the provision of public safety services by such entity. An application shall be granted under this subsection if the Commission finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) no other spectrum allocated to public safety services is immediately available to satisfy the requested public safety service use;
<br>
<br>(B) the requested use is technically feasible without causing harmful interference to other spectrum users entitled to protection from such interference under the Commission's regulations;
<br>
<br>(C) the use of the unassigned frequency for the provision of public safety services is consistent with other allocations for the provision of such services in the geographic area for which the application is made;
<br>
<br>(D) the unassigned frequency was allocated for its present use not less than 2 years prior to the date on which the application is granted; and
<br>
<br>(E) granting such application is consistent with the public interest.
<br>(2) Applicability
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall apply to any application to provide public safety services that is pending or filed on or after August 5, 1997.
<br>(d) Conditions on licenses
<br>
<br>In establishing service rules with respect to licenses granted pursuant to this section, the Commission—
<br>
<br>(1) shall establish interference limits at the boundaries of the spectrum block and service area;
<br>
<br>(2) shall establish any additional technical restrictions necessary to protect full-service analog television service and digital television service during a transition to digital television service;
<br>
<br>(3) may permit public safety services licensees and commercial licensees—
<br>
<br>(A) to aggregate multiple licenses to create larger spectrum blocks and service areas; and
<br>
<br>(B) to disaggregate or partition licenses to create smaller spectrum blocks or service areas; and
<br>
<br>(4) shall establish rules insuring that public safety services licensees using spectrum reallocated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) shall not be subject to harmful interference from television broadcast licensees.
<br>(e) Removal and relocation of incumbent broadcast licensees
<br>(1) Channels 52 to 69
<br>
<br>Any full-power television station licensee that holds a television broadcast license to operate between 698 and 806 megahertz may not operate at that frequency after June 12, 2009.
<br>(2) Incumbent qualifying low-power stations
<br>
<br>After making any allocation or assignment under this section, the Commission shall seek to assure, consistent with the Commission's plan for allotments for digital television service, that each qualifying low-power television station is assigned a frequency below 698 megahertz to permit the continued operation of such station.
<br>(f) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>(1) Public safety services
<br>
<br>The term "public safety services" means services—
<br>
<br>(A) the sole or principal purpose of which is to protect the safety of life, health, or property;
<br>
<br>(B) that are provided—
<br>

<br>(2) Remedies for failure to carry
<br>
<br>In addition to the remedies available to television broadcast stations under section 501(f) of title 17, the Commission may use the Commission's authority under this chapter to assure compliance with the obligations of this subsection, but in no instance shall a Commission enforcement proceeding be required as a predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under such section 501(f).
<br>(3) Low power station carriage optional
<br>
<br>No low power television station whose signals are provided under section 119(a)(14) 1 of title 17 shall be entitled to insist on carriage under this section, regardless of whether the satellite carrier provides secondary transmissions of the primary transmissions of other stations in the same local market pursuant to section 122 of such title, nor shall any such carriage be considered in connection with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.
<br>(4) Carriage of signals of local stations in certain markets
<br>
<br>A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000 subscribers shall (A) within 1 year after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as analog signals of each television broadcast station located in any local market within a State that is not part of the contiguous United States, and (B) within 30 months after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as digital signals of each such station. The retransmissions of such stations shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each station's local market, and the retransmissions of the stations in at least one market in the State shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas of the State that are not within a designated market area. The cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other States. Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall promulgate regulations concerning elections by television stations in such State between mandatory carriage pursuant to this section and retransmission consent pursuant to section 325(b) of this title, which shall take into account the schedule on which local television stations are made available to viewers in such State.
<br>(5) Nondiscrimination in carriage of high definition signals of noncommercial educational television stations
<br>(A) Existing carriage of high definition signals
<br>
<br>If, before the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, an eligible satellite carrier is providing, under section 122 of title 17, any secondary transmissions in high definition format to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station, then such satellite carrier shall carry the signals in high-definition format of qualified noncommercial educational television stations located within that local market in accordance with the following schedule:
<br>
<br>(i) By December 31, 2010, in at least 50 percent of the markets in which such satellite carrier provides such secondary transmissions in high definition format.
<br>
<br>(ii) By December 31, 2011, in every market in which such satellite carrier provides such secondary transmissions in high definition format.
<br>(B) New initiation of service
<br>
<br>If, on or after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, an eligible satellite carrier initiates the provision, under section 122 of title 17, of any secondary transmissions in high definition format to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station, then such satellite carrier shall carry the signals in high-definition format of all qualified noncommercial educational television stations located within that local market.
<br>(b) Good signal required
<br>(1) Costs
<br>
<br>A television broadcast station asserting its right to carriage under subsection (a) shall be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the designated local receive facility of the satellite carrier or to another facility that is acceptable to at least one-half the stations asserting the right to carriage in the local market.
<br>(2) Regulations
<br>
<br>The regulations issued under subsection (g) shall set forth the obligations necessary to carry out this subsection.
<br>(c) Duplication not required
<br>(1) Commercial stations
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a satellite carrier shall not be required to carry upon request the signal of any local commercial television broadcast station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by the satellite carrier within the same local market, or to carry upon request the signals of more than one local commercial television broadcast station in a single local market that is affiliated with a particular television network unless such stations are licensed to communities in different States.
<br>(2) Noncommercial stations
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe regulations limiting the carriage requirements under subsection (a) of satellite carriers with respect to the carriage of multiple local noncommercial television broadcast stations. To the extent possible, such regulations shall provide the same degree of carriage by satellite carriers of such multiple stations as is provided by cable systems under section 535 of this title.
<br>(d) Channel positioning
<br>
<br>No satellite carrier shall be required to provide the signal of a local television broadcast station to subscribers in that station's local market on any particular channel number or to provide the signals in any particular order, except that the satellite carrier shall retransmit the signal of the local television broadcast stations to subscribers in the stations' local market on contiguous channels and provide access to such station's signals at a nondiscriminatory price and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, on-screen program guide, or menu.
<br>(e) Compensation for carriage
<br>
<br>A satellite carrier shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility of the satellite carrier.
<br>(f) Remedies
<br>(1) Complaints by broadcast stations
<br>
<br>Whenever a local television broadcast station believes that a satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the satellite carrier failed to comply with such obligations. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 days after such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and comply with such obligations or state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with such obligations. A local television broadcast station that disputes a response by a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with such obligations may obtain review of such denial or response by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.
<br>(2) Opportunity to respond
<br>
<br>The Commission shall afford the satellite carrier against which a complaint is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.
<br>(3) Remedial actions; dismissal
<br>
<br>Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether the satellite carrier has met its obligations under subsections (b) through (e). If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate remedial action. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.
<br>(g) Carriage of local stations on a single reception antenna
<br>(1) Single reception antenna
<br>
<br>Each satellite carrier that retransmits the signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market shall retransmit such stations in such market so that a subscriber may receive such stations by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment.
<br>(2) Additional reception antenna
<br>
<br>If the carrier retransmits the signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market in high definition format, the carrier shall retransmit such signals in such market so that a subscriber may receive such signals by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment, but such antenna and associated equipment may be separate from the single reception antenna and associated equipment used to comply with paragraph (1).
<br>(h) Additional notices to subscribers, networks, and stations concerning signal carriage
<br>(1) Notices to and elections by subscribers concerning grandfathered signals
<br>

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to section 119 of title 17, any satellite carrier shall be permitted to provide the signals of no more than two network stations in a single day for each television network to any household not located within the local markets of those network stations.
<br>(B) Additional service
<br>
<br>In addition to signals provided under subparagraph (A), any satellite carrier may also provide service under the statutory license of section 122 of title 17, to the local market within which such household is located. The service provided under section 122 of such title may be in addition to the two signals provided under section 119 of such title.
<br>(2) Replacement of distant signals with local signals
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (1), the following rules shall apply after December 8, 2004:
<br>(A) Rules for grandfathered subscribers
<br>(i) For those receiving distant signals
<br>
<br>In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station solely by reason of section 119(e) 1 of title 17 (in this subparagraph referred to as a "distant signal"), and who, as of October 1, 2009, is receiving the distant signal of that network station, the following shall apply:
<br>
<br>(I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to the subscriber the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber—
<br>
<br>(aa) if, within 60 days after receiving the notice of the satellite carrier under section 338(h)(1) of this title, the subscriber elects to retain the distant signal; but
<br>
<br>(bb) only until such time as the subscriber elects to receive such local signal.
<br>
<br>(II) Notwithstanding subclause (I), the carrier may not retransmit the distant signal to any subscriber who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station solely by reason of section 119(e) 1 of title 17, unless such carrier, within 60 days after December 8, 2004, submits to that television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(i).
<br>(ii) For those not receiving distant signals
<br>
<br>In the case of any subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the distant signal of a network station solely by reason of section 119(e) 1 of title 17 and who did not receive a distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network on October 1, 2009, the carrier may not provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber.
<br>(B) Rules for other subscribers
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station under this section (in this subparagraph referred to as a "distant signal"), other than subscribers to whom subparagraph (A) applies, the following shall apply:
<br>
<br>(I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if the subscriber's satellite carrier, not later than March 1, 2005, submits to that television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(i).
<br>
<br>(II) In a case in which the satellite carrier does not make available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the signal of a local network station pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if—
<br>
<br>(aa) that subscriber seeks to subscribe to such distant signal before the date on which such carrier commences to carry pursuant to section 338 of this title the signals of stations from the local market of such local network station; and
<br>
<br>(bb) the satellite carrier, within 60 days after such date, submits to each television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(ii).
<br>(ii) Special circumstances
<br>
<br>A subscriber of a satellite carrier who was lawfully receiving the distant signal of a network station on the day before the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 may receive both such distant signal and the local signal of a network station affiliated with the same network until such subscriber chooses to no longer receive such distant signal from such carrier, whether or not such subscriber elects to subscribe to such local signal.
<br>(C) Future applicability
<br>
<br>A satellite carrier may not provide a distant signal (within the meaning of subparagraph (A) or (B)) to a person who—
<br>
<br>(i) is not a subscriber lawfully receiving such secondary transmission as of the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 and, at the time such person seeks to subscribe to receive such secondary transmission, resides in a local market where the satellite carrier makes available to that person the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to section 338 of this title (and the retransmission of such signal by such carrier can reach such subscriber); or
<br>
<br>(ii) lawfully subscribes to and receives a distant signal on or after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, and, subsequent to such subscription, the satellite carrier makes available to that subscriber the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same network as the distant signal (and the retransmission of such signal by such carrier can reach such subscriber), unless such person subscribes to the signal of the local network station within 60 days after such signal is made available.
<br>(D) Special rules for distant signals
<br>(i) Eligibility and signal testing
<br>
<br>A subscriber of a satellite carrier shall be eligible to receive a distant signal of a network station affiliated with the same network under this section if, with respect to a local network station, such subscriber—
<br>
<br>(I) is a subscriber whose household is not predicted by the model specified in subsection (c)(3) to receive the signal intensity required under section 73.622(e)(1) or, in the case of a low-power station or translator station transmitting an analog signal, section 73.683(a) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation;
<br>
<br>(II) is determined, based on a test conducted in accordance with section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation, not to be able to receive a signal that exceeds the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) or, in the case of a low-power station or translator station transmitting an analog signal, section 73.683(a) of such title, or a successor regulation; or
<br>
<br>(III) is in an unserved household, as determined under section 119(d)(10)(A) 1 of title 17.
<br>(ii) Pre-enactment distant signal subscribers
<br>
<br>Any eligible subscriber under this subparagraph who is a lawful subscriber to such a distant signal as of the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 may continue to receive such distant signal.
<br>(iii) Time-shifting prohibited
<br>
<br>In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to an eligible subscriber under this subparagraph the signal of a local network station pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only provide the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if, in the case of any local market in the 48 contiguous States of the United States, the distant signal is the secondary transmission of a station whose prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the prime time network programming of the affiliate of the same network in the local market.
<br>(iv) Savings provision
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect a satellite carrier's obligations under section 338 of this title.
<br>(E) Authority to grant station-specific waivers
<br>
<br>This paragraph shall not prohibit a retransmission of a distant signal of any distant network station to any subscriber to whom the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same network is available, if and to the extent that such local network station has affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of this paragraph to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of such distant network station to such subscriber.
<br>(F) Notices to networks of distant signal subscribers
<br>
<br>(i) Within 60 days after December 8, 2004, each satellite carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this paragraph shall submit to each network—
<br>
<br>(I) a list, aggregated by designated market area, identifying each subscriber provided such a signal by—
<br>
<br>(aa) name;
<br>
<br>(bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State, and zip code); and
<br>
<br>(cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and
<br>
<br>(II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier's knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(ii) Within 60 days after the date a satellite carrier commences to carry pursuant to section 338 of this title the signals of stations from a local market, such a satellite carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph shall submit to each network—
<br>
<br>(I) a list identifying each subscriber in that local market provided such a signal by—
<br>
<br>(aa) name;
<br>
<br>(bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State, and zip code); and
<br>
<br>(cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and
<br>
<br>(II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier's knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph.
<br>(G) Other provisions not affected
<br>
<br>This paragraph shall not affect the eligibility of a subscriber to receive secondary transmissions under section 340 of this title or as an unserved household included under section 119(a)(12) 1 of title 17.
<br>(H) Available defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, a satellite carrier makes available a local signal to a subscriber or person if the satellite carrier offers that local signal to other subscribers who reside in the same zip code as that subscriber or person.
<br>(3) Penalty for violation
<br>
<br>Any satellite carrier that knowingly and willfully provides the signals of television stations to subscribers in violation of this subsection shall be liable for a forfeiture penalty under section 503 of this title in the amount of $50,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection, relating to the provision of distant digital signals, shall be enforceable under the provisions of section 340(f) of this title.
<br>(b) Extension of network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and sports blackout to satellite retransmission
<br>(1) Extension of protections
<br>
<br>Within 45 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall commence a single rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations that—
<br>
<br>(A) apply network nonduplication protection (47 CFR 76.92) syndicated exclusivity protection (47 CFR 76.151), and sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of nationally distributed superstations by satellite carriers to subscribers; and
<br>
<br>(B) to the extent technically feasible and not economically prohibitive, apply sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of network stations by satellite carriers to subscribers.
<br>(2) Deadline for action
<br>
<br>The Commission shall complete all actions necessary to prescribe regulations required by this section so that the regulations shall become effective within 1 year after November 29, 1999.
<br>(c) Eligibility for retransmission
<br>(1) Repealed. Pub. L. 115–141, div. P, title IV, §402(i)(7), Mar. 23, 2018, 132 Stat. 1090
<br>(2) Waivers
<br>
<br>A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17 may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under section 119(d)(10)(B) 1 of title 17, if such station agrees to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within the 30-day period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.
<br>(3) Establishment of improved predictive model and on-location testing required
<br>(A) Predictive model
<br>
<br>Within 270 days after the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, the Commission shall develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations, through the use of an antenna, to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation, including to account for the continuing operation of translator stations and low power television stations. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Commission in CS Docket No. 98–201, as previously revised with respect to analog signals, and as recommended by the Commission with respect to digital signals in its Report to Congress in ET Docket No. 05–182, FCC 05–199 (released December 9, 2005). The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.
<br>(B) On-location testing
<br>
<br>The Commission shall issue an order completing its rulemaking proceeding in ET Docket No. 06–94 within 270 days after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010. In conducting such rulemaking, the Commission shall seek ways to minimize consumer burdens associated with on-location testing.
<br>(4) Objective verification
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber's inability to receive a signal of the signal intensity referenced in clause (i) of subsection (a)(2)(D), the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct the test referenced in such clause. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such clause demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the requisite signal intensity standard in such clause, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119(d)(10)(A) 1 of title 17.
<br>(B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs
<br>
<br>If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds such requisite signal intensity standard, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.
<br>(C) Avoidance of undue burden
<br>
<br>Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.
<br>(D) Reduction of verification burdens
<br>
<br>Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title from such carrier.
<br>(E) Exception
<br>
<br>A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a signal.
