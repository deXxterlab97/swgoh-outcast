<br>"If you think you live outside the Federal judicial district in which the court is located, you may request, not later than 20 days after your 1 receive this notice, that this proceeding to take your property be transferred by the court to the Federal judicial district in which you reside. You must make your request in writing, and either mail it or deliver it in person to the clerk of the court at [address]. You must also send a copy of your request to the Government at [address], so the Government will know you want the proceeding to be transferred.
<br>
<br>"Be sure to keep a copy of this notice for your own records. If you have any questions about your rights or about this procedure, you should contact a lawyer, an office of public legal assistance, or the clerk of the court.

<br>
<br>(c) Service.—A copy of the notice and a copy of the application for granting a remedy under this subchapter shall be served by counsel for the United States on the judgment debtor against whom such remedy is sought and on each person whom the United States, after diligent inquiry, has reasonable cause to believe has an interest in property to which the remedy is directed.
<br>
<br>(d) Hearing.—By requesting, within 20 days after receiving the notice described in section 3202(b), the court to hold a hearing, the judgment debtor may move to quash the order granting such remedy. The court that issued such order shall hold a hearing on such motion as soon as practicable, or, if so requested by the judgment debtor, within 5 days after receiving the request or as soon thereafter as possible. The issues at such hearing shall be limited—
<br>
<br>(1) to the probable validity of any claim of exemption by the judgment debtor;
<br>
<br>(2) to compliance with any statutory requirement for the issuance of the postjudgment remedy granted; and
<br>
<br>(3) if the judgment is by default and only to the extent that the Constitution or another law of the United States provides a right to a hearing on the issue, to—
<br>
<br>(A) the probable validity of the claim for the debt which is merged in the judgment; and
<br>
<br>(B) the existence of good cause for setting aside such judgment.
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall not be construed to afford the judgment debtor the right to more than one such hearing except to the extent that the Constitution or another law of the United States provides a right to more than one such hearing.
<br>
<br>(e) Sale of Property.—The property of a judgment debtor which is subject to sale to satisfy the judgment may be sold by judicial sale, pursuant to sections 2001, 2002, and 2004 or by execution sale pursuant to section 3203(g). If a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection (d), property with respect to which the request relates shall not be sold before such hearing.

<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "you".
<br>§3203. Execution
<br>
<br>(a) Property Subject to Execution.—All property in which the judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest shall be subject to levy pursuant to a writ of execution. The debtor's earnings shall not be subject to execution while in the possession, custody, or control of the debtor's employer. Co-owned property shall be subject to execution to the extent such property is subject to execution under the law of the State in which it is located.
<br>
<br>(b) Creation of Execution Lien.—A lien shall be created in favor of the United States on all property levied on under a writ of execution and shall date from the time of the levy. Such lien shall have priority over all subsequent liens and shall be for the aggregate amount of the judgment, costs, and interest. The execution lien on any real property as to which the United States has a judgment lien shall relate back to the judgment lien date.
<br>
<br>(c) Writ of Execution.—
<br>
<br>(1) Issuance.—On written application of counsel for the United States, the court may issue a writ of execution. Multiple writs may issue simultaneously, and successive writs may issue before the return date of a writ previously issued.
<br>
<br>(2) Form of writ.—
<br>
<br>(A) General contents.—A writ of execution shall specify the date that the judgment is entered, the court in which it is entered, the amount of the judgment if for money, the amount of the costs, the amount of interest due, the sum due as of the date the writ is issued, the rate of postjudgment interest, the name of the judgment debtor, and the judgment debtor's last known address.
<br>
<br>(B) Additional contents.—(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), the writ shall direct the United States marshal to satisfy the judgment by levying on and selling property in which the judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, but not to exceed property reasonably equivalent in value to the aggregate amount of the judgment, costs, and interest.
<br>
<br>(ii) A writ of execution issued on a judgment for the delivery to the United States of the possession of personal property, or for the delivery of the possession of real property, shall particularly describe the property, and shall require the marshal to deliver the possession of the property to the United States.
<br>
<br>(iii) A writ of execution on a judgment for the recovery of personal property or its value shall direct the marshal, in case a delivery of the specific property cannot be had, to levy and collect such value out of any property in which the judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest.
<br>
<br>(d) Levy of Execution.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Levy on property pursuant to a writ of execution issued under this section shall be made in the same manner as levy on property is made pursuant to a writ of attachment issued under section 3102(d).
<br>
<br>(2) Death of judgment debtor.—The death of the judgment debtor after a writ of execution is issued stays the execution proceedings, but any lien acquired by levy of the writ shall be recognized and enforced by the court for the district in which the estate of the deceased is located. The execution lien may be enforced—
<br>
<br>(A) against the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the estate of the deceased; or
<br>
<br>(B) if there be none, against the deceased's property coming to the heirs or devisees or at their option against cash in their possession, but only to the extent of the value of the property coming to them.
<br>
<br>(3) Records of united states marshal.—(A) A United States marshal receiving a writ of execution shall endorse thereon the exact hour and date of receipt.
<br>
<br>(B) The United States marshal shall make a written record of every levy, specify the property on which levy is made, the date on which levy is made, and the marshal's costs, expenses, and fees.
<br>
<br>(C) The United States marshal shall make a written return to the court on each writ of execution stating concisely what is done pursuant to the writ and shall deliver a copy to counsel for the United States who requests the writ. The writ shall be returned not more than—
<br>
<br>(i) 90 days after the date of issuance if levy is not made; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 10 days after the date of sale of property on which levy is made.
<br>
<br>(e) Appointment of Receiver.—Pending the levy of execution, the court may appoint a receiver to manage property described in such writ if there is a substantial danger that the property will be removed from the jurisdiction of the court, lost, materially injured or damaged, or mismanaged.
<br>
<br>(f) Replevy; Redemption.—
<br>
<br>(1) Before execution sale.—(A) Before execution sale, the United States marshal may return property 1 to the judgment debtor any personal property taken in execution, on—
<br>
<br>(i) satisfaction of the judgment, interest, and costs, and any costs incurred in connection with scheduling the sale; or
<br>
<br>(ii) receipt from the judgment debtor of a bond—
<br>
<br>(I) payable to the United States, with 2 or more good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the marshal, conditioned on the delivery of the property to the marshal at the time and place named in the bond to be sold under subsection (g); or
<br>
<br>(II) for the payment to the marshal of a fair value thereof which shall be stated in the bond.
<br>
<br>(B) A judgment debtor who sells or disposes of property replevied under subparagraph (A) shall pay the United States marshal the stipulated value of such property.
<br>
<br>(C) If the judgment debtor fails to deliver such property to the United States marshal pursuant to the terms of the delivery described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) and fails to pay the United States marshal the stipulated value of such property, the United States marshal shall endorse the bond "forfeited" and return it to the court from which the writ of execution issued. If the judgment is not fully satisfied, the court shall issue a writ of execution against the judgment debtor and the sureties on the bond for the amount due, not exceeding the stipulated value of the property, on which execution no delivery bond shall be taken, which instruction shall be endorsed on the writ.
<br>
<br>(2) After execution sale.—The judgment debtor shall not be entitled to redeem the property after the execution sale.
<br>
<br>(g) Execution Sale.—
<br>
<br>(1) General procedures.—An execution sale under this section shall be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner—
<br>
<br>(A) Sale of real property.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—(I) Except as provided in clause (ii), real property, or any interest therein, shall be sold, after the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date of levy under subsection (d), for cash at public auction at the courthouse of the county, parish, or city in which the greater part of the property is located or on the premises or some parcel thereof.
<br>
<br>(II) The court may order the sale of any real property after the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date of levy under subsection (d) if the court determines that such property is likely to perish, waste, be destroyed, or otherwise substantially depreciate in value during the 90-day period beginning on the date of levy.
<br>
<br>(III) The time and place of sale of real property, or any interest therein, under execution shall be advertised by the United States marshal, by publication of notice, once a week for at least 3 weeks prior to the sale, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county or parish where the property is located. The first publication shall appear not less than 25 days preceding the day of sale. The notice shall contain a statement of the authority by which the sale is to be made, the time of levy, the time and place of sale, and a brief description of the property to be sold, sufficient to identify the property (such as a street address for urban property and the survey identification and location for rural property), but it shall not be necessary for the notice to contain field notes. Such property shall be open for inspection and appraisal, subject to the judgment debtor's reasonable objections, for a reasonable period before the day of sale.
<br>
<br>(IV) The United States marshal shall serve written notice of public sale by personal delivery, or certified or registered mail, to each person whom the marshal has reasonable cause to believe, after a title search is conducted by the United States, has an interest in property under execution, including lienholders, co-owners, and tenants, at least 25 days before the day of sale, to the last known address of each such person.
<br>
<br>(ii) Sale of city lots.—If the real property consists of several lots, tracts, or parcels in a city or town, each lot, tract, or parcel shall be offered for sale separately, unless not susceptible to separate sale because of the character of improvements.
<br>
<br>(iii) Sale of rural property.—If the real property is not located in a city or town, the judgment debtor may—
<br>
<br>(I) divide the property into lots of not less than 50 acres or in such greater or lesser amounts as ordered by the court;
<br>
<br>(II) furnish a survey of such prepared by a registered surveyor; and
<br>
<br>(III) designate the order in which those lots shall be sold.
<br>
<br> When a sufficient number of lots are sold to satisfy the amount of the execution and costs of sale, the marshal shall stop the sale.
<br>
<br>(B) Sale of personal property.—(i) Personal property levied on shall be offered for sale on the premises where it is located at the time of levy, at the courthouse of the county, parish or city wherein it is located, or at another location if ordered by the court. Personal property susceptible of being exhibited shall not be sold unless it is present and subject to the view of those attending the sale unless—
<br>
<br>(I) the property consists of shares of stock in corporations;
<br>
<br>(II) by reason of the nature of the property, it is impractical to exhibit it; or
<br>
<br>(III) the debtor's interest in the property does not include the right to the exclusive possession.
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), personal property, or any interest therein, shall be sold after the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date of levy under subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(II) The court may order the sale of any personal property before the expiration of such 30-day period if the court determines that such property is likely to perish, waste, be destroyed, or otherwise substantially depreciate in value during such 30-day period.
<br>
<br>(iii) Notice of the time and place of the sale of personal property shall be given by the United States marshal by posting notice thereof for not less than 10 days successively immediately before the day of sale at the courthouse of any county, parish, or city, and at the place where the sale is to be made.
<br>
<br>(iv) The United States marshal shall serve written notice of public sale by personal delivery, or registered or certified mail at their last known addresses, on the judgment debtor and other persons who the marshal has reasonable cause to believe, after diligent inquiry, have a substantial interest in the property.
<br>
<br>(2) Postponement of sale.—The United States marshal may postpone an execution sale from time to time by continuing the required posting or publication of notice until the date to which the sale is postponed, and appending, at the foot of each such notice of a current copy of the following:
<br>
<br>"The above sale is postponed until the        day of          , 19  , at    o'clock   .M.,            , United States Marshal for the District of            , by                , Deputy, dated            ."
<br>
<br>(3) Sale procedures.—
<br>
<br>(A) Bidding requirements.—A bidder at an execution sale of property, may be required by the United States marshal to make a cash deposit of as much as 20 percent of the sale price proposed before the bid is accepted.
<br>
<br>(B) Resale of property.—If the terms of the sale are not complied with by the successful bidder, the United States marshal shall proceed to sell the property again on the same day if there is sufficient time. If there is insufficient time, the marshal shall schedule and notice a subsequent sale of the property as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>
<br>(4) Rights and liabilities of purchasers.—
<br>
<br>(A) Transfer of title after sale.—
<br>
<br>(i) If property is sold under this subsection and the successful bidder complies with the terms of the sale, the United States marshal shall execute and deliver all documents necessary to transfer to the successful bidder, without warranty, all the rights, titles, interests, and claims of the judgment debtor in the property.
<br>
<br>(ii) If the successful bidder dies before execution and delivery of the documents needed to transfer ownership, the United States marshal shall execute and deliver them to the successful bidder's estate. Such delivery to the estate shall have the same effect as if accomplished during the lifetime of the purchaser.
<br>
<br>(B) Purchaser considered innocent purchaser without notice.—The purchaser of property sold under execution shall be deemed to be an innocent purchaser without notice if the purchaser would have been considered an innocent purchaser without notice had the sale been made voluntarily and in person by the judgment debtor.
<br>
<br>(C) Liability of successful bidder who fails to comply.—A successful bidder at an execution sale who fails to comply with the terms of the sale shall forfeit to the United States the cash deposit or, at the election of the United States, shall be liable to the United States, on a subsequent sale of the property, for all net losses incurred by the United States as a result of such failure.
<br>
<br>(h) Disposition of Proceeds; Further Levy.—
<br>
<br>(1) Distribution of sale proceeds.—(A) The United States marshal shall first deliver to the judgment debtor such amounts to which the judgment debtor is entitled from the sale of partially exempt property.
<br>
<br>(B) The United States marshal shall next deduct from the proceeds of an execution sale of property an amount equal to the reasonable expenses incurred in making the levy of execution and in keeping and maintaining the property.
<br>
<br>(C) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the United States marshal shall deliver the balance of the proceeds to the counsel for the United States as soon as practicable.
<br>
<br>(D) If more proceeds are received from the execution sale than is necessary to satisfy the executions held by the United States marshal, the marshal shall pay the surplus to the judgment debtor.
<br>
<br>(2) Further levy if execution not satisfied.—If the proceeds of the execution sale of the property levied on are insufficient to satisfy the execution, the United States marshal shall proceed on the same writ of execution to levy other property of the judgment debtor.

<br>
<br>1 So in original. The word "property" probably should not appear.
<br>§3204. Installment payment order
<br>
<br>(a) Authority To Issue Order.—Subject to subsection (c), if it is shown that the judgment debtor—
<br>
<br>(1) is receiving or will receive substantial nonexempt disposable earnings from self employment that are not subject to garnishment; or
<br>
<br>(2) is diverting or concealing substantial earnings from any source, or property received in lieu of earnings;
<br>
<br>then upon motion of the United States and notice to the judgment debtor, the court may, if appropriate, order that the judgment debtor make specified installment payments to the United States. Notice of the motion shall be served on the judgment debtor in the same manner as a summons or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. In fixing the amount of the payments, the court shall take into consideration after a hearing, the income, resources, and reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor's dependents, any other payments to be made in satisfaction of judgments against the judgment debtor, and the amount due on the judgment in favor of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Modification of Order.—On motion of the United States or the judgment debtor, and upon a showing that the judgment debtor's financial circumstances have changed or that assets not previously disclosed by the judgment debtor have been discovered, the court may modify the amount of payments, alter their frequency, or require full payment.
<br>
<br>(c) Limitation.—(1) An order may not be issued under subsection (a), and if so issued shall have no force or effect, against a judgment debtor with respect to whom there is in effect a writ of garnishment of earnings issued under this chapter and based on the same debt.

<br>§3205. Garnishment
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—A court may issue a writ of garnishment against property (including nonexempt disposable earnings) in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and which is in the possession, custody, or control of a person other than the debtor, in order to satisfy the judgment against the debtor. Co-owned property shall be subject to garnishment to the same extent as co-owned property is subject to garnishment under the law of the State in which such property is located. A court may issue simultaneous separate writs of garnishment to several garnishees. A writ of garnishment issued under this subsection shall be continuing and shall terminate only as provided in subsection (c)(10).
<br>
<br>(b) Writ.—
<br>
<br>(1) General requirements.—The United States shall include in its application for a writ of garnishment—
<br>
<br>(A) the judgment debtor's name, social security number (if known), and last known address;
<br>
<br>(B) the nature and amount of the debt owed and the facts that not less than 30 days has elapsed since demand on the debtor for payment of the debt was made and the judgment debtor has not paid the amount due; and
<br>
<br>(C) that the garnishee is believed to have possession of property (including nonexempt disposable earnings) in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest.
<br>
<br>(2) Proper garnishee for particular property.—
<br>
<br>(A) If the property consists of a right to or share in the stock of an association or corporation, or interests or profits therein, for which a certificate of stock or other negotiable instrument is not outstanding, the corporation, or the president or treasurer of the association shall be the garnishee.
<br>
<br>(B) If the property consists of an interest in a partnership interest, any partner other than the debtor shall be the garnishee on behalf of the partnership.
<br>
<br>(C) If the property or a debt is evidenced by a negotiable instrument for the payment of money, a negotiable document of title or a certificate of stock of an association or corporation, the instrument, document, or certificate shall be treated as property capable of delivery and the person holding it shall be the garnishee, except that—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to clause (ii), in the case of a security which is transferable in the manner set forth in State law, the entity that carries on its books an account in the name of the debtor in which is reflected such security shall be the garnishee; and
<br>
<br>(ii) notwithstanding clause (i), the pledgee shall be the garnishee if such security is pledged.
<br>
<br>(c) Procedures Applicable to Writ.—
<br>
<br>(1) Court determination.—If the court determines that the requirements of this section are satisfied, the court shall issue an appropriate writ of garnishment.
<br>
<br>(2) Form of writ.—The writ shall state—
<br>
<br>(A) The nature and amount of the debt, and any cost and interest owed with respect to the debt.
<br>
<br>(B) The name and address of the garnishee.
<br>
<br>(C) The name and address of counsel for the United States.
<br>
<br>(D) The last known address of the judgment debtor.
<br>
<br>(E) That the garnishee shall answer the writ within 10 days of service of the writ.
<br>
<br>(F) That the garnishee shall withhold and retain any property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and for which the garnishee is or may become indebted to the judgment debtor pending further order of the court.
<br>
<br>(3) Service of writ.—The United States shall serve the garnishee and the judgment debtor with a copy of the writ of garnishment and shall certify to the court that this service was made. The writ shall be accompanied by—
<br>
<br>(A) an instruction explaining the requirement that the garnishee submit a written answer to the writ; and
<br>
<br>(B) instructions to the judgment debtor for objecting to the answer of the garnishee and for obtaining a hearing on the objections.
<br>
<br>(4) Answer of the garnishee.—In its written answer to the writ of garnishment, the garnishee shall state under oath—
<br>
<br>(A) whether the garnishee has custody, control or possession of such property;
<br>
<br>(B) a description of such property and the value of such interest;
<br>
<br>(C) a description of any previous garnishments to which such property is subject and the extent to which any remaining property is not exempt; and
<br>
<br>(D) the amount of the debt the garnishee anticipates owing to the judgment debtor in the future and whether the period for payment will be weekly or another specified period.
<br>
<br>The garnishee shall file the original answer with the court issuing the writ and serve a copy on the debtor and counsel for the United States.
<br>
<br>(5) Objections to answer.—Within 20 days after receipt of the answer, the judgment debtor or the United States may file a written objection to the answer and request a hearing. The party objecting shall state the grounds for the objection and bear the burden of proving such grounds. A copy of the objection and request for a hearing shall be served on the garnishee and all other parties. The court shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the date the request is received by the court, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, and give notice of the hearing date to all the parties.
<br>
<br>(6) Garnishee's failure to answer or pay.—If a garnishee fails to answer the writ of garnishment or to withhold property in accordance with the writ, the United States may petition the court for an order requiring the garnishee to appear before the court to answer the writ and to so withhold property before the appearance date. If the garnishee fails to appear, or appears and fails to show good cause why the garnishee failed to comply with the writ, the court shall enter judgment against the garnishee for the value of the judgment debtor's nonexempt interest in such property (including nonexempt disposable earnings). The court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the United States and against the garnishee if the writ is not answered within the time specified therein and a petition requiring the garnishee to appear is filed as provided in this section.
<br>
<br>(7) Disposition order.—After the garnishee files an answer and if no hearing is requested within the required time period, the court shall promptly enter an order directing the garnishee as to the disposition of the judgment debtor's nonexempt interest in such property. If a hearing is timely requested, the order shall be entered within 5 days after the hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
<br>
<br>(8) Priorities.—Judicial orders and garnishments for the support of a person shall have priority over a writ of garnishment issued under this section. As to any other writ of garnishment or levy, a garnishment issued under this section shall have priority over writs which are issued later in time.
<br>
<br>(9) Accounting.—(A) While a writ of garnishment is in effect under this section, the United States shall give an annual accounting on the garnishment to the judgment debtor and the garnishee.
<br>
<br>(B) Within 10 days after the garnishment terminates, the United States shall give a cumulative written accounting to the judgment debtor and garnishee of all property it receives under a writ of garnishment. Within 10 days after such accounting is received, the judgment debtor or garnishee may file a written objection to the accounting and a request for hearing. The party objecting shall state grounds for the objection. The court shall hold a hearing on the objection within 10 days after the court receives the request for a hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
<br>
<br>(10) Termination of garnishment.—A garnishment under this chapter is terminated only by—
<br>
<br>(A) a court order quashing the writ of garnishment;
<br>
<br>(B) exhaustion of property in the possesion,1 custody, or control of the garnishee in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest (including nonexempt disposable earnings), unless the garnishee reinstates or reemploys the judgment debtor within 90 days after the judgment debtor's dismissal or resignation; or
<br>
<br>(C) satisfaction of the debt with respect to which the writ is issued.

<br>§3304. Transfer fraudulent as to a debt to the United States
<br>
<br>(a) Debt Arising Before Transfer.—Except as provided in section 3307, a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a debt to the United States which arises before the transfer is made or the obligation is incurred if—
<br>
<br>(1)(A) the debtor makes the transfer or incurs the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation; and
<br>
<br>(B) the debtor is insolvent at that time or the debtor becomes insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation; or
<br>
<br>(2)(A) the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor was insolvent at the time; and
<br>
<br>(B) the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.
<br>
<br>(b) Transfers Without Regard to Date of Judgment.—(1) Except as provided in section 3307, a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a debt to the United States, whether such debt arises before or after the transfer is made or the obligation is incurred, if the debtor makes the transfer or incurs the obligation—
<br>
<br>(A) with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor; or
<br>
<br>(B) without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation if the debtor—
<br>
<br>(i) was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or
<br>
<br>(ii) intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.
<br>
<br>(2) In determining actual intent under paragraph (1), consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether—
<br>
<br>(A) the transfer or obligation was to an insider;
<br>
<br>(B) the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;
<br>
<br>(C) the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;
<br>
<br>(D) before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit;
<br>
<br>(E) the transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;
<br>
<br>(F) the debtor absconded;
<br>
<br>(G) the debtor removed or concealed assets;
<br>
<br>(H) the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;
<br>
<br>(I) the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;
<br>
<br>(J) the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and
<br>
<br>(K) the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.

<br>§3305. When transfer is made or obligation is incurred
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this subchapter:
<br>
<br>(1) A transfer is made—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to an asset that is real property (other than a fixture, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of the asset), when the transfer is so far perfected that a good-faith purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is superior to the interest of the transferee; and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture, when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire, otherwise than under this subchapter, a judicial lien that is superior to the interest of the transferee.
<br>
<br>(2) If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as approved in paragraph (1) and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of an action or proceeding for relief under this subchapter, the transfer is deemed made immediately before the commencement of the action or proceeding.
<br>
<br>(3) If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph (1), the transfer is made when it becomes effective between the debtor and the transferee.
<br>
<br>(4) A transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset transferred.
<br>
<br>(5) An obligation is incurred—
<br>
<br>(A) if oral, when it becomes effective between the parties; or
<br>
<br>(B) if evidenced by a writing executed by the obligor, when such writing is delivered to or for the benefit of the obligee.

<br>§3306. Remedies of the United States
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—In an action or proceeding under this subchapter for relief against a transfer or obligation, the United States, subject to section 3307 and to applicable principles of equity and in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may obtain—
<br>
<br>(1) avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy the debt to the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) a remedy under this chapter against the asset transferred or other property of the transferee; or
<br>
<br>(3) any other relief the circumstances may require.
<br>
<br>(b) Limitation.—A claim for relief with respect to a fraudulent transfer or obligation under this subchapter is extinguished unless action is brought—

<br>(1) under section 3304(b)(1)(A) within 6 years after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred or, if later, within 2 years after the transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant;

<br>(2) under subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1)(B) of section 3304 within 6 years after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred; or

<br>
<br>(b) Limitation.—Except as provided in subsection (d), to the extent a transfer is voidable in an action or proceeding by the United States under section 3306(a)(1), the United States may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred, but not to exceed the judgment on a debt. The judgment may be entered against—
<br>
<br>(1) the first transferee of the asset or the person for whose benefit the transfer was made; or
<br>
<br>(2) any subsequent transferee, other than a good faith transferee who took for value or any subsequent transferee of such good-faith transferee.
<br>
<br>(c) Value of Asset.—For purposes of subsection (b), the value of the asset is the value of the asset at the time of the transfer, subject to adjustment as the equities may require.
<br>
<br>(d) Rights of Good Faith Transferees and Obligees.—Notwithstanding voidability of a transfer or an obligation under this subchapter, a good-faith transferee or obligee is entitled, to the extent of the value given the debtor for the transfer or obligation, to—
<br>
<br>(1) a lien on or a right to retain any interest in the asset transferred;
<br>
<br>(2) enforcement of any obligation incurred; or
<br>
<br>(3) a reduction in the amount of the liability on the judgment.
<br>
<br>(e) Exceptions.—A transfer is not voidable under section 3304(a) or section 3304(b)(2) if the transfer results from—
<br>
<br>(1) termination of a lease upon default by the debtor when the termination is pursuant to the lease and applicable law; or
<br>
<br>(2) enforcement of a security interest in compliance with article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or its equivalent in effect in the State where the property is located.
<br>
<br>(f) Limitation of Voidability.—A transfer is not voidable under section 3304(a)(2)—
<br>
<br>(1) to the extent the insider gives new value to or for the benefit of the debtor after the transfer is made unless the new value is secured by a valid lien;
<br>
<br>(2) if made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the insider; or
<br>
<br>(3) if made pursuant to a good-faith effort to rehabilitate the debtor and the transfer secured both present value given for that purpose and an antecedent debt of the debtor.

<br>CHAPTER 180—ASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
<br>Sec.
<br>4001.
<br>Assumption of contractual obligations related to transfers of rights in motion pictures.
<br>
<br>        
<br>§4001. Assumption of contractual obligations related to transfers of rights in motion pictures
<br>
<br>(a) Assumption of Obligations.—(1) In the case of a transfer of copyright ownership under United States law in a motion picture (as the terms "transfer of copyright ownership" and "motion picture" are defined in section 101 of title 17) that is produced subject to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements negotiated under the laws of the United States, if the transfer is executed on or after the effective date of this chapter and is not limited to public performance rights, the transfer instrument shall be deemed to incorporate the assumption agreements applicable to the copyright ownership being transferred that are required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the transferee shall be subject to the obligations under each such assumption agreement to make residual payments and provide related notices, accruing after the effective date of the transfer and applicable to the exploitation of the rights transferred, and any remedies under each such assumption agreement for breach of those obligations, as those obligations and remedies are set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the transferee knows or has reason to know at the time of the transfer that such collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award against the transferor under the collective bargaining agreement, the transferor does not have the financial ability to satisfy the award within 90 days after the order is issued.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), "knows or has reason to know" means any of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Actual knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Constructive knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture, arising from recordation of a document pertaining to copyright in the motion picture under section 205 of title 17 or from publication, at a site available to the public on-line that is operated by the relevant union, of information that identifies the motion picture as subject to a collective bargaining agreement with that union, if the site permits commercially reasonable verification of the date on which the information was available for access.
<br>
<br>(ii) Clause (i) applies only if the transfer referred to in subsection (a)(1) occurs—
<br>
<br>(I) after the motion picture is completed, or
<br>
<br>(II) before the motion picture is completed and—
<br>
<br>(aa) within 18 months before the filing of an application for copyright registration for the motion picture under section 408 of title 17, or
<br>
<br>(bb) if no such application is filed, within 18 months before the first publication of the motion picture in the United States.
<br>
<br>(C) Awareness of other facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular transfer from which it is apparent that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.
<br>
<br>(b) Scope of Exclusion of Transfers of Public Performance Rights.—For purposes of this section, the exclusion under subsection (a) of transfers of copyright ownership in a motion picture that are limited to public performance rights includes transfers to a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer to the extent that the station, system, or programmer is functioning as an exhibitor of the motion picture, either by exhibiting the motion picture on its own network, system, service, or station, or by initiating the transmission of an exhibition that is carried on another network, system, service, or station. When a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer, or other transferee, is also functioning otherwise as a distributor or as a producer of the motion picture, the public performance exclusion does not affect any obligations imposed on the transferee to the extent that it is engaging in such functions.
<br>
<br>(c) Exclusion for Grants of Security Interests.—Subsection (a) shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(1) a transfer of copyright ownership consisting solely of a mortgage, hypothecation, or other security interest; or
<br>
<br>(2) a subsequent transfer of the copyright ownership secured by the security interest described in paragraph (1) by or under the authority of the secured party, including a transfer through the exercise of the secured party's rights or remedies as a secured party, or by a subsequent transferee.
<br>
<br>The exclusion under this subsection shall not affect any rights or remedies under law or contract.
<br>
<br>(d) Deferral Pending Resolution of Bona Fide Dispute.—A transferee on which obligations are imposed under subsection (a) by virtue of paragraph (1) of that subsection may elect to defer performance of such obligations that are subject to a bona fide dispute between a union and a prior transferor until that dispute is resolved, except that such deferral shall not stay accrual of any union claims due under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.
<br>
<br>(e) Scope of Obligations Determined by Private Agreement.—Nothing in this section shall expand or diminish the rights, obligations, or remedies of any person under the collective bargaining agreements or assumption agreements referred to in this section.
<br>
<br>(f) Failure To Notify.—If the transferor under subsection (a) fails to notify the transferee under subsection (a) of applicable collective bargaining obligations before the execution of the transfer instrument, and subsection (a) is made applicable to the transferee solely by virtue of subsection (a)(1)(B), the transferor shall be liable to the transferee for any damages suffered by the transferee as a result of the failure to notify.
<br>
<br>(g) Determination of Disputes and Claims.—Any dispute concerning the application of subsections (a) through (f) shall be determined by an action in United States district court, and the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party and may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
<br>
<br>(h) Study.—The Comptroller General, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall conduct a study of the conditions in the motion picture industry that gave rise to this section, and the impact of this section on the motion picture industry. The Comptroller General shall report the findings of the study to the Congress within 2 years after the effective date of this chapter.

<br>
<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–223, §2, Aug. 10, 2010, 124 Stat. 2380, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the first amendment to the Constitution, and is necessary to promote the vigorous dialogue necessary to shape public policy in a representative democracy.
<br>
<br>"(2) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights of United States authors and publishers, and in turn chilling the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States interest of the citizenry in receiving information on matters of importance, by seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do not provide the full extent of free-speech protections to authors and publishers that are available in the United States, and suing a United States author or publisher in that foreign jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>"(3) These foreign defamation lawsuits not only suppress the free speech rights of the defendants to the suit, but inhibit other written speech that might otherwise have been written or published but for the fear of a foreign lawsuit.
<br>
<br>"(4) The threat of the libel laws of some foreign countries is so dramatic that the United Nations Human Rights Committee examined the issue and indicated that in some instances the law of libel has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work. The advent of the internet and the international distribution of foreign media also create the danger that one country's unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest.
<br>
<br>"(5) Governments and courts of foreign countries scattered around the world have failed to curtail this practice of permitting libel lawsuits against United States persons within their courts, and foreign libel judgments inconsistent with United States first amendment protections are increasingly common."
<br>§4102. Recognition of foreign defamation judgments
<br>
<br>(a) First Amendment Considerations.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a domestic court shall not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment for defamation unless the domestic court determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the defamation law applied in the foreign court's adjudication provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press in that case as would be provided by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located; or
<br>
<br>(B) even if the defamation law applied in the foreign court's adjudication did not provide as much protection for freedom of speech and press as the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State, the party opposing recognition or enforcement of that foreign judgment would have been found liable for defamation by a domestic court applying the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located.
<br>
<br>(2) Burden of establishing application of defamation laws.—The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of making the showings required under subparagraph (A) or (B).
<br>
<br>(b) Jurisdictional Considerations.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a domestic court shall not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment for defamation unless the domestic court determines that the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the foreign court comported with the due process requirements that are imposed on domestic courts by the Constitution of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Burden of establishing exercise of jurisdiction.—The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of making the showing that the foreign court's exercise of personal jurisdiction comported with the due process requirements that are imposed on domestic courts by the Constitution of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) Judgment Against Provider of Interactive Computer Service.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a domestic court shall not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment for defamation against the provider of an interactive computer service, as defined in section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230) unless the domestic court determines that the judgment would be consistent with section 230 if the information that is the subject of such judgment had been provided in the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Burden of establishing consistency of judgment.—The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of establishing that the judgment is consistent with section 230.
<br>
<br>(d) Appearances Not a Bar.—An appearance by a party in a foreign court rendering a foreign judgment to which this section applies shall not deprive such party of the right to oppose the recognition or enforcement of the judgment under this section, or represent a waiver of any jurisdictional claims.
<br>
<br>(e) Rule of Construction.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to—
<br>
<br>(1) affect the enforceability of any foreign judgment other than a foreign judgment for defamation; or
<br>
<br>(2) limit the applicability of section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230) to causes of action for defamation.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 111–223, §3(a), Aug. 10, 2010, 124 Stat. 2381.)
<br>§4103. Removal
<br>
<br>In addition to removal allowed under section 1441, any action brought in a State domestic court to enforce a foreign judgment for defamation in which—
<br>
<br>(1) any plaintiff is a citizen of a State different from any defendant;
<br>
<br>(2) any plaintiff is a foreign state or a citizen or subject of a foreign state and any defendant is a citizen of a State; or
<br>
<br>(3) any plaintiff is a citizen of a State and any defendant is a foreign state or citizen or subject of a foreign state,
<br>
<br>may be removed by any defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending without regard to the amount in controversy between the parties.
