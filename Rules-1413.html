<br>
<br>(3) If a judge of the Court of Federal Claims who retires under this section accepts compensation for civil office or employment under the Government of the United States (other than for the performance of judicial duties under subsection (d)), such judge shall forfeit all rights to an annuity under this section for the period for which such compensation is received.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If a judge makes an election under this paragraph—

<br>(B) An election under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) may be made by a judge only if such judge meets the age and service requirements for retirement under subsection (a),
<br>

<br>
<br>(k)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1)(B), an individual who has filed an election under subsection (f) to receive an annuity may revoke such election at any time before the first day on which such annuity would (but for such revocation) begin to accrue with respect to such individual.
<br>
<br>(2) Any revocation under this subsection shall be made by filing a notice thereof in writing with the Director of 1 Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of any revocation under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) for purposes of this section, the individual shall be treated as not having filed an election under subsection (f) to receive an annuity,
<br>
<br>(B) for purposes of section 376 of this title—
<br>
<br>(i) the individual shall be treated as not having filed an election under section 376(a)(1), and
<br>
<br>(ii) section 376(g) shall not apply, and the amount credited to such individual's account (together with interest at 3 percent per annum, compounded on December 31 of each year to the date on which the revocation is filed) shall be returned to such individual,

<br>(C) no credit shall be allowed for any service as a judge of the Court of Federal Claims or as a commissioner of the United States Court of Claims unless with respect to such service either there has been deducted and withheld the amount required by chapter 83 or 84 (as the case may be) of title 5 or there has been deposited in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to the amount so required, with interest,
<br>
<br>(D) the Court of Federal Claims shall deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to the additional amount it would have contributed to such Fund but for the election under subsection (f), and
<br>
<br>(E) if subparagraph (D) is complied with, service on the Court of Federal Claims or as a commissioner of the United States Court of Claims shall be treated as service with respect to which deductions and contributions had been made during the period of service.
<br>
<br>(l)(1) There is established in the Treasury a fund which shall be known as the "Court of Federal Claims Judges Retirement Fund". The Fund is appropriated for the payment of annuities and other payments under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, in interest bearing securities of the United States, such currently available portions of the Court of Federal Claims Judges Retirement Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund. The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Court of Federal Claims Judges Retirement Fund amounts required to reduce to zero the unfunded liability of the Fund.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "unfunded liability" means the estimated excess, determined on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of section 9503 of title 31, of the present value of all benefits payable from the Court of Federal Claims Judges Retirement Fund, over the balance in the Fund as of the date the unfunded liability is determined. In making any determination under this subparagraph, the Comptroller General shall use the applicable information contained in the reports filed pursuant to section 9503 of title 31, with respect to the retirement annuities provided for in this section.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The "Board of General Appraisers" was designated "United States Customs Court" by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, §1, 44 Stat. 669. General provisions concerning such court were incorporated in section 1518 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, until amended by act October 10, 1940, ch. 843, §1, 54 Stat. 1101, adding a new section to the Judicial Code of 1911, when they were transferred to section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. They are retained in title 28 by this revision.
<br>
<br>In this connection former Congressman Walter Chandler said, "Among the major subjects needing study and revision are special courts, such as the Customs Court, which should be fitted into the judicial system." (See U.S. Law Weekly, Nov. 7, 1939.)
<br>History of Court
<br>
<br>The United States Customs Court [now Court of International Trade] as "constituted on June 17, 1930", consisted of nine members as provided by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §518, 42 Stat. 972, which established the Board of General Appraisers, designated the "United States Customs Court" by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, §1, 44 Stat. 669.
<br>
<br>Provisions similar to these were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §518, 42 Stat. 972. That section was superseded by section 518 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was repealed by section 651 (a)(1) of said 1930 act.
<br>
<br>The sentence in the former first paragraph as to sitting in a case previously participated in, is from act Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, §28, 36 Stat. 98, which combined and amended Customs Administrative Act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §12, 26 Stat. 136, and section 31, as added by act May 27, 1908, ch. 205, 35 Stat. 406. Section 12 of the act of 1890 was expressly saved from repeal by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §643, 42 Stat. 989, and prior acts, but its provisions, other than the sentence above mentioned, were omitted from the Code.
<br>
<br>Provisions for the review of decisions of Boards of General Appraisers by the Circuit Courts, made by section 15 of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, were superseded by provisions for such review by the Court of Customs Appeals created by section 29 added to that act by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6. The provisions of said new section 29 were incorporated in and superseded by chapter 8 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, incorporated into the Code as former chapter 8 of Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary.
<br>
<br>R.S. §2608 provided for the appointment of four appraisers of merchandise, to be employed in visiting ports of entry under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and to assist in the appraisement of merchandise as might be deemed necessary by the Secretary to protect and insure uniformity in the collection of the revenue from customs. It was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §29, 26 Stat. 141.
<br>
<br>R.S. §2609 provided for the appointment of merchant appraisers. R.S. §2610 made every merchant refusing to serve as such appraiser liable to a penalty. Both sections were superseded by the provisions relating to appraisers and appraisements of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131, and subsequent acts, and were repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §642, 42 Stat. 989.
<br>
<br>R.S. §2945, which contained a provision similar to that of R.S. §2610, was repealed, without mention of section 2610, by said Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §29, 26 Stat. 141, and was again repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, §642, 42 Stat. 989.
<br>
<br>R.S. §2725, which prescribed the compensation of merchant appraisers, and section 2726, which prescribed the salary of the general appraiser at New York, were superseded by the provisions relating to general appraisers and appraisers made by the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §§12, 13, 26 Stat. 136, as amended by the Payne-Aldrich Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, §28.
<br>
<br>R.S. §2727 fixed the salary of the four general appraisers at the sum of $2,500 a year each, and their actual traveling expenses. It was repealed by act Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, 19 Stat. 246.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §296 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, 187(a), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, §1, 54 Stat. 1101).
<br>
<br>This section contains a part of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 252, 253, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "when in the opinion of such division or judge the ends of justice so require," which followed the phrase "grant a rehearing or retrial," were omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>The term "chief judge" was substituted for "presiding judge." (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The phrase "petitions for remission of additional duties" was added to the first paragraph at the suggestion of the court to conform to existing practice.
<br>
<br>Reappraisement appeals are heard by a single judge and reviewed by a division. (See sections 2631 and 2636 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The provision of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the presiding judge shall designate one of the three judges of a division to preside over such division was omitted as in conflict with section 253 of this title (also taken from section 296 of title 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed.), which provides that judges shall preside according to the seniority of their commissions. The latter provision is in accord with present practice.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.

<br>
<br>This amendment clarifies section 254 of title 28, U.S.C., by restoring language of the original law.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§17, 22 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§13, 18, 36 Stat. 1089; Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 18, 38 Stat. 203; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §§3, 5, 42 Stat. 839; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, §4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, §1, 56 Stat. 1094).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates all provisions of sections 17 and 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of circuit judges.
<br>
<br>The revised section omits a reference to the Chief Justice contained in said section 22, since in exercising the powers under subsection (b), he acts as a circuit justice.
<br>
<br>Paragraph (d) of said section 17, making the section applicable to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is omitted since such court is included in this revision because the District of Columbia is made a separate circuit. (See section 41 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Provisions of said sections 17 and 22 authorizing the senior Associate Justice to act in the absence of the Chief Justice of the United States were omitted as surplusage in view of specific authority to so act in section 3 of this title.
<br>
<br>The words in said section 17 "for such time as the business of such district court may require," were omitted as inconsistent with the language of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which employed the words "the public interest requires" and "from time to time and until he shall otherwise direct." The revised section and sections 294 and 296 of this title make clear the power to make designation and assignment without any limitation of time, to revoke such designation and assignment and to make, from time to time, new designations and assignments.
<br>
<br>The term "chief judge" of the circuit was substituted for "senior circuit judge." (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)
<br>
<br>References in said sections 17 and 22 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 292, 295 and 296 of this title.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 296 of this title.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
