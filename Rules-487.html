<br>(c) Eligibility criteria for State other credit support programs
<br>
<br>For a State other credit support program to be approved under this section, that program shall be required to be a program of the State that—
<br>
<br>(1) can demonstrate that, at a minimum, $1 of public investment by the State program will cause and result in $1 of new private credit;
<br>
<br>(2) can demonstrate a reasonable expectation that, when considered with all other State programs of the State, such State programs together have the ability to use amounts of new Federal contributions to, or for the account of, all such programs in the State to cause and result in amounts of new small business lending at least 10 times the new Federal contribution amount;
<br>
<br>(3) for those State other credit support programs that provide their credit support through 1 or more financial institution lenders, requires the financial institution lenders to have a meaningful amount of their own capital resources at risk in their small business lending; and

<br>
<br>(1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, and its residents to be derived from the Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the approved State other credit support program, including the extent to which resulting small business lending will expand economic opportunities.
<br>
<br>(2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the management team of the State other credit support program.
<br>
<br>(3) The capacity of the State other credit support program to manage increases in the volume of its small business lending.
<br>

<br>
<br>(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1012.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §1 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, §1, 32 Stat. 51; Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, §4, 32 Stat. 826; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, §1, 37 Stat. 736; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §21, 46 Stat. 26).
<br>
<br>Section 1 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., provided that the "Census Office" temporarily established in the Department of the Interior in accordance with the act of Mar. 3, 1899 (ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014) "is made" a permanent office in the Department of Commerce. Such wording is no longer necessary, and the provisions, as revised in this section, merely continue the Bureau (of the Census) as an agency within, and under the jurisdiction of, the Department of Commerce.
<br>§3. Seal
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall have a seal containing such device as has been selected heretofore, or as the Secretary may select hereafter. A description of such seal with an impression thereof shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. The seal shall remain in the custody of the Secretary or such officer or employee of the Bureau as he designates, and shall be affixed to all documents authenticated by the Bureau. Judicial notice shall be taken of the seal.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on acts Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, §31, 30 Stat. 1021; Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, §6, 32 Stat. 52.
<br>
<br>Section is new to the United States Code, but is in accordance with current practice. Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014, which established the "Census Office" on a temporary basis, provided in section 31 thereof (30 Stat. 1021) for a seal for that office. The office was made permanent by act Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 51, and section 6 of that act (32 Stat. 52) continued in full force and effect "for the taking of the Thirteenth and subsequent censuses" all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, not inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act. Therefore, since the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal, section 31 of the 1899 act, providing for the seal, remained in force as it was not inconsistent. Section 33 of act July 2, 1909, ch. 2, 36 Stat. 10, which act (36 Stat. 1) related to the Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses, repealed the said act of Mar. 3, 1899, specifically, and all "other" laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act. These repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous, but it was probably the intent of Congress, as it was the intent thereof at the time of enactment of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, referred to above, to continue in effect all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, that were not inconsistent with the act of July 2, 1909. The 1909 act contained no provisions with respect to the seal, and it accordingly follows that the provisions of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, with respect thereto, continued in force. This is also the interpretation of the Bureau of the Census, which has continued to use a seal through the years in connection with "certificates and attestations".
<br>
<br>In any event, this new section merely confirms past and present practice, and restores, if it does not preserve, statutory authority for possession and use of the seal which is a very necessary part of the operations of the Bureau. Further, the section should serve to forestall future differences of interpretation. In the past, some States have refused to recognize the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not authorized by law. In all probability, this position was taken, not as the result of a search of the Statutes at Large, which would have been a difficult project, but because provisions relating to the seal were not set out in the United States Code where they would have been readily accessible.
<br>
<br>The language of this section follows substantially the language of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, referred to above, but has been reworded because of jurisdictional and other changes since that time. The "Census Office" was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and Labor by act Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, §4, 32 Stat. 826. Act Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, §1, 37 Stat. 736, changed the name of the latter to the Department of Commerce, and created, as a separate department, the Department of Labor. It transferred a number of bureaus and agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Labor, but these transfers did not affect the Bureau of the Census, which has remained under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce. 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, transferred all functions of all officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate them or any of his other functions to any of such officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies. Therefore, in this section, "Secretary", and "Secretary or such officer or employee of the Bureau as he designates", were substituted, respectively, for two references to the Director of the Census, to conform with such Plan.

<br>§4. Functions of Secretary; regulations; delegation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall perform the functions and duties imposed upon him by this title, may issue such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out such functions and duties, and may delegate the performance of such functions and duties and the authority to issue such rules and regulations to such officers and employees of the Department of Commerce as he may designate.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Section is new, and was inserted to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, effective May 24, 1950, §§1, 2, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which is set out as a note under section 591 of title 5, U. S. C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees [now set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees]. That plan transferred all functions (with a few exceptions not applicable to the Census Bureau) of all agencies, officers and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate the functions so transferred, or any of his other functions, to such agencies, officers or employees within the Department as he designates.
<br>
<br>See, also, section 253 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for delegation of functions in connection with the quinquennial censuses of governments, and authorized the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to such censuses. That section has been omitted from this revised title, as the provision thereof for delegation of functions is covered by this section, and the provision thereof which related to rules and regulations is covered by section 22 of title 1, U.S.C., 1952 ed., General Provisions.
<br>
<br>Because of the transfer effected by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above, sections of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which prescribed functions of the Bureau of the Census, the Census Office, or the Director of the Census, have, in this revised title, been changed to refer to the Secretary.

This consolidated section vests such duties in the Secretary of Commerce, which is in conformity not only with such sections 216 and 251(b), but also with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, effective May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§122, 215, 252, and section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §15, 46 Stat. 25; June 19, 1948, ch. 502, §2, 62 Stat. 479; July 15, 1949, ch. 338, title VI, §607, 63 Stat. 441; Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910, §1, 64 Stat. 784).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 215 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with those parts of sections 122 and 252 of such title which respectively made such section 215 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufacturers and the mineral industries and other businesses, and governments, and with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such section 215 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (see subchapters I, II, and III of chapter 5 of this title). As originally enacted in 1929, such section 215 had related only to the decennial censuses of population, agriculture, etc., the provisions for which are continued in subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provisions, as revised in this section, relate, not only to the censuses referred to above, but also, to all other investigations provided for in this title. This was probably the Congressional intent.
<br>
<br>Words in section 215 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., "on request of the Director of the Census", were omitted since all functions under this title are vested primarily in the Secretary (of Commerce), in view of 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
