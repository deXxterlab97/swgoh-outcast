<br>Section 506(a), referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is section 506(a) of Pub. L. 102–511, which was classified to section 5856(a) of this title and was omitted from the Code. Section 506(a) directed amendment of section 221 of Pub. L. 102–228, which was set out in a note under section 2551 of this title, but did not become effective, pursuant to section 5856(c) of this title. Section 221 of Pub. L. 102–228 was repealed by Pub. L. 113–291, div. A, title XIII, §1351(1), Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3606.
<br>
<br>The Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), is title II of Pub. L. 102–228, Dec. 12, 1991, 105 Stat. 1693. The reference to subtitle B of the Act probably means part B of the Act because title II of Pub. L. 102–228 does not contain a subtitle B. Part B was set out in a note under section 2551 of this title and was comprised of sections 211 and 212, which were repealed, respectively, by Pub. L. 110–181, div. A, title XIII, §1304(a)(1)(A), Jan. 28, 2008, 122 Stat. 412, and Pub. L. 113–291, div. A, title XIII, §1351(1), Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3606.

<br>(4)(A) In the event of a significant unforeseen development related to the activities of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (or any successor organization) for which the Secretary of Defense determines that financial assistance under this section is required at a level which would result in the total amount of assistance provided under this section during the then-current fiscal year exceeding the amount of any limitation provided by law on the total amount of such assistance for that fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense may provide such assistance with respect to that fiscal year notwithstanding that limitation. Funds for such purpose may be derived from any funds available to the Department of Defense for that fiscal year.
