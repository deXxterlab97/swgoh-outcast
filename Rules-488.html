<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may establish, at rates of compensation to be fixed by him without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as many temporary positions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the work provided for by law. Bureau employees who are transferred to any such temporary positions shall not lose their permanent civil service status by reason of the transfer. The Secretary may make appointments to such temporary positions in conformity with the civil service laws and rules.
<br>
<br>(b) In addition to employees of the Department of Commerce, employees of other departments and independent offices of the Government may, with the consent of the head of the respective department or office, be employed and compensated for field work in connection with the work provided for by law without regard to section 301 of the Dual Compensation Act.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may utilize temporary staff, including employees of Federal, State, or local agencies or instrumentalities, and employees of private organizations to assist the Bureau in performing the work authorized by this title, but only if such temporary staff is sworn to observe the limitations imposed by section 9 of this title.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§203, 216, and section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §§3, 16, 46 Stat. 21, 25; July 6, 1949, ch. 298, §§1, 2, 63 Stat. 406; July 15, 1949, ch. 338, title VI, §607, 63 Stat. 441; Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, title XI, §1106(a), 63 Stat. 972; July 16, 1952, ch. 912, 66 Stat. 736).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates parts of sections 203 and 216 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such sections 203 and 216 applicable to the censuses of housing.
<br>
<br>Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, transportation, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and section 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made section 203 of such title applicable to those censuses. However, since the particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by section 1442(b) of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in such section 1442 of title 42 (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section relates only to such decennial censuses.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), "Departmental Service" was substituted for "District of Columbia", since the Bureau of the Census now has its headquarters in Maryland, and not in the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>In this section, a reference to the Bureau of the Census was changed to a reference to the Department of Commerce, and references to the Director of the Census were changed in all but one case to references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title. The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that appointments under the particular provisions thereof that have been carried into subsection (a) of this revised section should be made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Census, have been omitted from such subsection (a) for the same reason. Further, words "or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this title" were inserted after "Director of the Census" in par. (1) of subsection (a), to conform with such 1950 Reorganization Plan.

<br>The first paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for each decennial census period, was omitted as obsolete and superseded, in view of section 122 of such title, which made such section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures and other businesses, and to surveys (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title), thus rendering such first paragraph ineffective and meaningless. See also section 121(b) of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.
<br>
<br>The third proviso in the second paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to disabled war veterans, their widows, and, under certain circumstances, to their wives, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
<br>
<br>Remainder of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., is incorporated in this subchapter, and for remainder of section 216 thereof, and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.

<br>
<br>"(1) the policy of the Secretary for the use of all individuals as temporary staff pursuant to such section 23(c) to assist the Bureau of the Census in performing work authorized under such title 13;
<br>

<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may utilize the services of nontemporary employees of the Bureau (by assignment, promotion, appointment, detail, or otherwise) in temporary positions established for any census, for not to exceed the period during which appropriations are available for that census. Whenever the Secretary determines that the services of an employee which have been utilized under this section are no longer required in such a temporary position, he may, without regard to the provisions of any other law, return the employee to a continuing position, with rank and compensation not less than that which he held in his last permanent position in the Bureau: Provided, That no employee shall, by reason of his service in a temporary position under this subsection, lose the protection of any law or regulation with respect to his separation, suspension, furlough, or reduction in rank or compensation below the level held in his last permanent position in the Bureau. Service by a nontemporary employee in a temporary position under this subsection shall be creditable for step-increases (both periodic and longevity) under title VII of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, as though it were a continuation of service in his last permanent position.
<br>
<br>(b) As used in this title with respect to appointments or positions, "temporary" shall be construed to mean not in excess of one year, or not in excess of the specific period during which appropriations are available for the conduct of a particular census, whichever is longer. No employee of the Bureau who holds only a temporary appointment within the meaning of this section shall be considered as other than strictly temporary for purposes of any other provision of law relating to separations, suspensions, or reductions in rank or compensation.
<br>
<br>(c) The enlisted men and officers of the uniformed services may be appointed and compensated for service in temporary enumerator positions for the enumeration of personnel of the uniformed services.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary may fix compensation on a piece-price basis without limitation as to the amount earned per diem, and payments may be made to enumerators for the use of private automobiles on official business without regard to section 4 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as amended (5 U.S.C. 837), but at rates not in excess of the rates provided by that Act.
<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary may authorize the expenditure of necessary sums for travel expenses of persons selected for appointment for attendance at training courses held by the Department of Commerce with respect to any of the work provided for by law.
<br>
<br>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law prohibiting the expenditure of public money for telephone service, the Secretary, under such regulations as he shall prescribe, may authorize reimbursement for tolls or charges for telephone service from private residences or private apartments to the extent such charges are determined by the Secretary to have been incurred to facilitate the collection of information in connection with the censuses and surveys authorized by this title.

<br>
<br>The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that the Director of the Census might delegate to the supervisors the authority to appoint enumerators, was omitted because all functions of the Director and other officers and employees of the Department of Commerce and its bureaus and agencies were transferred to the Secretary by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above. However, section 4 of this title provides for delegation of functions by the Secretary.

<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§111, 113 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, §7, 32 Stat. 52; June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §3, 46 Stat. 21; Mar. 4, 1931, ch. 490, 46 Stat. 1517; 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, §4(e), eff.

<br>
<br>Section consolidates part of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with section 113 of such title which also related to statistics with respect to crime and to the "defective, dependent, and delinquent classes".
<br>
<br>"Secretary", meaning the Secretary of Commerce, was substituted for "Director of the Census" to conform with Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., authorizing statistics relating to transportation by water, and express business, to mines, mining, quarries, and minerals, to savings banks and other savings institutions, mortgage, loan, and investment companies, and similar institutions, and to street railways, electric light and power, telephone, and telegraph business, were omitted as superseded and covered by sections 121–123 of such title (enacted in 1948), which are set out elsewhere in this title. See Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., also authorized the decennial collection of statistics relating to the fishing industry "in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service". In the basic statutory provision (see amendment by act June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218, "Fish and Wildlife Service" read "Bureau of Fisheries" and it was changed, by the codifiers, in such section 111 to the former designation because of 1940 Reorganization Plan No. III, §3, 5 F.R. 2107, 54 Stat. 1232, which consolidated the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into one agency to be known as the "Fish and Wildlife Service". However, at the time of the enactment of the 1906 act, referred to above, both the Bureau of the Fisheries, and the Census Bureau (then referred to as the "Census Office"), were in the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the Department of the Interior by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, §4(e), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1431, and it is within that department that the Fish and Wildlife Service now functions. Therefore, such provision in section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., has been omitted from this revised title as obsolete. In any event section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title) is broad enough to authorize such collection.
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which authorized statistics relating to religion, and the provisions thereof which related to the designation of reports, are set out as separate sections in this subchapter; and the provisions thereof which related to the preparation of schedules, and which authorized the appointment of special agents, are set out in chapter 1 of this title. See Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>The proviso in section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which prohibited the collection of statistics relating to religious or church membership when the disclosure of such information was prohibited by religious or church doctrine, teaching or discipline, has been incorporated in chapter 7 of this title. See Distribution Table.
<br>§102. Religion
<br>
<br>The Secretary may collect decennially statistics relating to religious bodies.

<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §111 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, §7, 32 Stat. 52; June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §3, 46 Stat. 21; 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, §4(e), eff.

<br>
<br>Section was taken from that part of section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to designation of reports prepared under that section. For remainder of such section 111, see this subchapter, and Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C. 1952 ed., provided that the reports prepared under the provisions of that section should be designated as "Special Reports of the Census Office". In this revised section it is provided that such reports shall be designated as " 'Special Reports' followed by the name of whatever bureau or agency of the Department of Commerce is designated by the Secretary to collect and compile such statistics". This change conforms with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred the functions of all agencies, bureaus, officers, and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary, and vested power in him to delegate any of such transferred functions, or any of his other functions, to any of such agencies, bureaus, officers, or employees. See section 4 of this title.

<br>Section 7 of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 52, cited above, from which section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., was derived, contained additional provisions (which were not classified to the United States Code) relating to the duty of the Director of the Census to publish the Official Register of the United States, and to the transmission to him of the data to be included therein. Such provisions have been omitted as they were superseded by act Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 421, §2(a)(b), 43 Stat. 1105, which was formerly classified to section 3 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and which, in turn, was repealed by section 5 of act Aug. 28, 1935, ch. 795, 49 Stat. 957, and superseded by sections 1 and 2 of that act. Such sections 1 and 2, as amended, are classified to section 654 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees. Under that section, the Official Register is published by the Civil Service Commission. Provisions relating to its distribution are contained in sections 139, 139a and 280a of title 44, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Public Printing and Documents.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §121 (June 19, 1948, ch. 502, §1, 62 Stat. 478; June 18, 1954, ch. 315, 68 Stat. 258).
<br>
<br>Section was subsection (a) of section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. The remainder of such section 121, which constituted subsection (b) thereof, is incorporated in subchapter IV of this chapter.
<br>
<br>At the beginning, "The Secretary", meaning the Secretary of Commerce, was substituted for a reference to the Director of the Bureau of the Census, and, at the end, the provision that the territorial scope of the censuses should be determined by the Secretary was substituted for the provision of section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that such determination should be made by the Director with the approval of the Secretary, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all officers and employees, agencies and bureaus of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary. However, the Secretary, under that plan, may delegate any of such transferred functions, as well as any other of his functions, to any of such officers, employees, agencies and bureaus. See, also, section 4 of this title.
<br>
<br>The reference in section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the year "1949" as the year for commencement of the quinquennial censuses was changed to the year "1954", since the former designation is obsolete, and the provision of such section that the census of manufacturers should not be taken in 1949 was omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

The Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor shall provide the Office such assistance and cooperation as may be necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this subsection."
<br>§132. Controlling law; effect on other agencies
<br>
<br>To the extent that the provisions of this subchapter or subchapter IV of this chapter conflict with any other provision of this title or other law, pertaining to the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, the provisions of this title shall control; but nothing in this title shall be deemed to revoke or impair the authority of any other Federal agency with respect to the collection or release of information.

<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §123 (June 19, 1948, ch. 502, §3, 62 Stat. 479).
<br>
<br>Section was derived from all of section 123 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., except the first sentence. That sentence is incorporated with other provisions in chapter 1 of this title. See Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>The reference "Secretary or Department of Commerce" was substituted for reference to the Bureau of the Census to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—POPULATION, HOUSING, AND UNEMPLOYMENT
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1997—Pub. L. 105–113, §3(b)(1), Nov. 21, 1997, 111 Stat. 2275, substituted "POPULATION, HOUSING, AND UNEMPLOYMENT" for "POPULATION, HOUSING, AGRICULTURE, IRRIGATION,, AND UNEMPLOYMENT".
<br>
<br>1986—Pub. L. 99–544, §1(b), Oct. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 3046, struck out "DRAINAGE" after "IRRIGATION,".
<br>§141. Population and other census information
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year, which date shall be known as the "decennial census date", in such form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys. In connection with any such census, the Secretary is authorized to obtain such other census information as necessary.
<br>
<br>(b) The tabulation of total population by States under subsection (a) of this section as required for the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States shall be completed within 9 months after the census date and reported by the Secretary to the President of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) The officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting of each State may, not later than 3 years before the decennial census date, submit to the Secretary a plan identifying the geographic areas for which specific tabulations of population are desired. Each such plan shall be developed in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, which he shall furnish to such officers or public bodies not later than April 1 of the fourth year preceding the decennial census date. Such criteria shall include requirements which assure that such plan shall be developed in a nonpartisan manner. Should the Secretary find that a plan submitted by such officers or public bodies does not meet the criteria established by him, he shall consult to the extent necessary with such officers or public bodies in order to achieve the alterations in such plan that he deems necessary to bring it into accord with such criteria. Any issues with respect to such plan remaining unresolved after such consultation shall be resolved by the Secretary, and in all cases he shall have final authority for determining the geographic format of such plan. Tabulations of population for the areas identified in any plan approved by the Secretary shall be completed by him as expeditiously as possible after the decennial census date and reported to the Governor of the State involved and to the officers or public bodies having responsibility for legislative apportionment or districting of such State, except that such tabulations of population of each State requesting a tabulation plan, and basic tabulations of population of each other State, shall, in any event, be completed, reported, and transmitted to each respective State within one year after the decennial census date.
<br>
<br>(d) Without regard to subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary, in the year 1985 and every 10 years thereafter, shall conduct a mid-decade census of population in such form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys, taking into account the extent to which information to be obtained from such census will serve in lieu of information collected annually or less frequently in surveys or other statistical studies. The census shall be taken as of the first day of April of each such year, which date shall be known as the "mid-decade census date".
<br>
<br>(e)(1) If—
<br>
<br>(A) in the administration of any program established by or under Federal law which provides benefits to State or local governments or to other recipients, eligibility for or the amount of such benefits would (without regard to this paragraph) be determined by taking into account data obtained in the most recent decennial census, and
<br>
<br>(B) comparable data is obtained in a mid-decade census conducted after such decennial census,
<br>
<br>then in the determination of such eligibility or amount of benefits the most recent data available from either the mid-decade or decennial census shall be used.
<br>
<br>(2) Information obtained in any mid-decade census shall not be used for apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, nor shall such information be used in prescribing congressional districts.
<br>
<br>(f) With respect to each decennial and mid-decade census conducted under subsection (a) or (d) of this section, the Secretary shall submit to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the census—
<br>
<br>(1) not later than 3 years before the appropriate census date, a report containing the Secretary's determination of the subjects proposed to be included, and the types of information to be compiled, in such census;
<br>
<br>(2) not later than 2 years before the appropriate census date, a report containing the Secretary's determination of the questions proposed to be included in such census; and
<br>
<br>(3) after submission of a report under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection and before the appropriate census date, if the Secretary finds new circumstances exist which necessitate that the subjects, types of information, or questions contained in reports so submitted be modified, a report containing the Secretary's determination of the subjects, types of information, or questions as proposed to be modified.
<br>
<br>(g) As used in this section, "census of population" means a census of population, housing, and matters relating to population and housing.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1019; Pub. L. 85–207, §9, Aug. 28, 1957, 71 Stat. 483; Pub. L. 94–171, §§1, 2(a), Dec. 23, 1975, 89 Stat. 1023, 1024; Pub. L. 94–521, §7(a), Oct. 17, 1976, 90 Stat. 2461.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §201 (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, §1, 46 Stat. 21; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158).
<br>
<br>References to the Secretary, meaning the Secretary of Commerce, were substituted for references to the Director of the Census, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provision for taking the censuses in "1930 and every ten years thereafter" was changed to "1960 and every ten years thereafter" since the censuses for the years 1930, 1940 and 1950 have been completed.
<br>
<br>The requirement that decennial censuses of "distribution" and "mines" should also be taken was omitted as superseded by section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (enacted in 1948), the provisions of which were carried into subchapter I of this chapter.
<br>
<br>Section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., the Public Health and Welfare (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), made all provisions of chapter 4 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., applicable to the housing censuses provided for in such section. However, section 201 of such title 13 (which section was a part of such chapter 4), which, as indicated above, has been carried into this revised section, could not, except, possibly, for the provisions thereof relating to the territorial scope of the censuses and to the census duties of the governors of Guam, Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Canal Zone, have any relevancy to such housing censuses, and such section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., contained its own provisions relating to territorial scope of the housing censuses. Therefore the provisions of this revised section have not been made so applicable.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>Statistical Sampling or Adjustment in Decennial Enumeration of Population
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–119, title II, §209, Nov. 26, 1997, 111 Stat. 2480, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) it is the constitutional duty of the Congress to ensure that the decennial enumeration of the population is conducted in a manner consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial enumeration of the population is the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States;
<br>
<br>"(3) section 2 of the 14th article of amendment to the Constitution clearly states that Representatives are to be 'apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State';
<br>
<br>"(4) article I, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution clearly requires an 'actual Enumeration' of the population, and section 195 of title 13, United States Code, clearly provides 'Except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as "sampling" in carrying out the provisions of this title.';
<br>
<br>"(5) the decennial enumeration of the population is one of the most critical constitutional functions our Federal Government performs;
<br>
<br>"(6) it is essential that the decennial enumeration of the population be as accurate as possible, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(7) the use of statistical sampling or statistical adjustment in conjunction with an actual enumeration to carry out the census with respect to any segment of the population poses the risk of an inaccurate, invalid, and unconstitutional census;
<br>
<br>"(8) the decennial enumeration of the population is a complex and vast undertaking, and if such enumeration is conducted in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of the Constitution or laws of the United States, it would be impracticable for the States to obtain, and the courts of the United States to provide, meaningful relief after such enumeration has been conducted; and
<br>
<br>"(9) Congress is committed to providing the level of funding that is required to perform the entire range of constitutional census activities, with a particular emphasis on accurately enumerating all individuals who have historically been undercounted, and toward this end, Congress expects—
<br>
<br>"(A) aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach campaigns in hard-to-count communities;
<br>
<br>"(B) the hiring of enumerators from within those communities;
<br>
<br>"(C) continued cooperation with local government on address list development; and
<br>
<br>"(D) maximized census employment opportunities for individuals seeking to make the transition from welfare to work.
<br>
<br>"(b) Any person aggrieved by the use of any statistical method in violation of the Constitution or any provision of law (other than this Act [see Tables for classification]), in connection with the 2000 or any later decennial census, to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress, may in a civil action obtain declaratory, injunctive, and any other appropriate relief against the use of such method.
<br>
<br>"(c) For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>"(1) the use of any statistical method as part of a dress rehearsal or other simulation of a census in preparation for the use of such method, in a decennial census, to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress shall be considered the use of such method in connection with that census; and
