<br>
<br>"(2) In approving postponement of public disclosure of an assassination record, the Review Board shall seek to—

<br>§2108. Responsibility for custody, use, and withdrawal of records
<br>
<br>(a) The Archivist shall be responsible for the custody, use, and withdrawal of records transferred to him. When records, the use of which is subject to statutory limitations and restrictions, are so transferred, permissive and restrictive statutory provisions with respect to the examination and use of records applicable to the head of the agency from which the records were transferred or to employees of that agency are applicable to the Archivist and to the employees of the National Archives and Records Administration, respectively. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, when the head of a Federal agency states, in writing, restrictions that appear to him to be necessary or desirable in the public interest with respect to the use or examination of records being considered for transfer from his custody to the Archivist, the Archivist shall, if he concurs,,1 impose such restrictions on the records so transferred, and may not relax or remove such restrictions without the written concurrence of the head of the agency from which the material was transferred, or of his successor in function, if any. In the event that a Federal agency is terminated and there is no successor in function, the Archivist is authorized to relax, remove, or impose restrictions on such agency's records when he determines that such action is in the public interest. Statutory and other restrictions referred to in this subsection shall remain in force until the records have been in existence for thirty years unless the Archivist by order, having consulted with the head of the transferring Federal agency or his successor in function, determines, with respect to specific bodies of records, that for reasons consistent with standards established in relevant statutory law, such restrictions shall remain in force for a longer period. Restriction on the use or examination of records deposited with the National Archives of the United States imposed by section 3 of the National Archives Act, approved June 19, 1934, shall continue in force regardless of the expiration of the tenure of office of the official who imposed them but may be removed or relaxed by the Archivist with the concurrence in writing of the head of the agency from which material was transferred or of his successor in function, if any.
<br>
<br>(b) With regard to the census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses, any release pursuant to this section of such identifying information contained in such records shall be made by the Archivist pursuant to the specifications and agreements set forth in the exchange of correspondence on or about the date of October 10, 1952, between the Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Archivist of the United States, together with all amendments thereto, now or hereafter entered into between the Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Archivist of the United States. Such amendments, if any, shall be published in the Register.

<br>
<br>WHEREAS under Chapter 21 of Title 44, United States Code, the Archivist of the United States is authorized to accept for deposit in the National Archives of the United States the records of any Federal agency or of the Congress of the United States that are determined by the Archivist to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation by the United States Government, as well as the papers and other historical materials of any official or former official of the Government, and to make provisions for the exhibition of materials transferred to him; and.
<br>
<br>WHEREAS many of the exhibits and displays so prepared, produced, or otherwise created by the executive departments and agencies possess historical significance which warrants their preservation and exhibition as part of the archival and cultural heritage of the United States:

<br>
<br>"(7) the need to give to Richard M. Nixon, or his heirs, for his sole custody and use, tape recordings and other materials which are not likely to be related to the need described in paragraph (1) and are not otherwise of general historical significance.

Any such challenge shall be treated by the court as a matter requiring immediate consideration and resolution, and such challenge shall have priority on the docket of such court over other cases.
<br>
<br>"(b) If, under the procedures established by subsection (a), a judicial decision is rendered that a particular provision of this title, or a particular regulation issued under the authority granted by this title, is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such decision shall not affect in any way the validity or enforcement of any other provision of this title or any regulation issued under the authority granted by this title.

<br>
<br>(4) Prior to accepting any gift under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) for the purpose of making any physical or material change or addition to a Presidential archival depository, or prior to implementing any provision of law requiring the making of such a change or addition, the Archivist shall submit a report in writing on the proposed change or addition to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The report shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) a description of such gift;

<br>(C) accept any gift under subparagraph (C) of such paragraph for the purpose of making any physical or material change to a Presidential archival depository,
<br>
<br>until the expiration of a period of 60 days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date on which the Archivist transmits the report required under paragraph (3) of this subsection with respect to such Presidential archival depository or the report required under paragraph (4) of this subsection with respect to such change or addition, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(b) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, he may deposit in a Presidential archival depository papers, documents, or other historical materials accepted under section 2111 of this title, or Federal records appropriate for preservation.
<br>
<br>(c) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, he may exercise, with respect to papers, documents, or other historical materials deposited under this section, or otherwise, in a Presidential archival depository, all the functions and responsibilities otherwise vested in him pertaining to Federal records or other documentary materials in his custody or under his control.

<br>(d) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, he may cooperate with and assist a university, institution of higher learning, institute, foundation, or other organization or qualified individual to further or to conduct study or research in historical materials deposited in a Presidential archival depository.
<br>
<br>(e) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, he may charge and collect reasonable fees for the privilege of visiting and viewing exhibit rooms or museum space, or for the occasional, non-official use of rooms and spaces (and services related to such use), in a Presidential archival depository.
<br>
<br>(f) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, he may provide reasonable office space in a Presidential archival depository for the personal use of a former President of the United States.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest, the Archivist may solicit and accept gifts or bequests of money or other property for the purpose of maintaining, operating, protecting, or improving a Presidential archival depository. The proceeds of gifts or bequests, together with the proceeds from fees or from sales of historical materials, copies or reproductions, catalogs, or other items, having to do with a Presidential archival depository, shall be paid into an account in the National Archives Trust Fund and shall be held, administered, and expended for the benefit and in the interest of the Presidential archival depository in connection with which they were received, and for the same purposes and objects, including custodial and administrative services for which appropriations for the maintenance, operation, protection, or improvement of Presidential archival depositories might be expended.
<br>
<br>(2) The Archivist shall provide for the establishment in such Trust Fund of separate endowments for the maintenance of the land, facility, and equipment of each Presidential archival depository, to which shall be credited any gifts or bequests received under paragraph (1) that are offered for that purpose. Income to each such endowment shall be available to cover the cost of facility operations, but shall not be available for the performance of archival functions under this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The Archivist shall not accept or take title to any land, facility, or equipment under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1), or enter into any agreement to use any land, facility, or equipment under subparagraph (B) of such subsection for the purpose of creating a Presidential archival depository, unless the Archivist determines that there is available, by gift or bequest for deposit under paragraph (2) of this subsection in an endowment with respect to such depository, an amount for the purpose of maintaining such land, facility, and equipment equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the total cost of acquiring or constructing such facility and of acquiring and installing such equipment, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) 20 percent; plus
<br>
<br>(B)(i) if title to the land is to be vested in the United States, the product of—
<br>
<br>(I) the total cost of acquiring the land upon which such facility is located, or such other measure of the value of such land as is mutually agreed upon by the Archivist and the donor, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) 20 percent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if title to the land is not to be vested in the United States, the product of—
<br>
<br>(I) the total cost to the donor of any improvements to the land upon which such facility is located (other than such facility and equipment), multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) 20 percent; plus
<br>
<br>(C) if the Presidential archival depository will exceed 70,000 square feet in area, an amount equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the total cost described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A); plus
<br>
<br>(II) the total cost described in subclause (I) or (II) of subparagraph (B)(i), as the case may be, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) the percentage obtained by dividing the number of square feet by which such depository will exceed 70,000 square feet by 70,000.
<br>
<br>(4) If a proposed physical or material change or addition to a Presidential archival depository would result in an increase in the costs of facility operations, the Archivist may not accept any gift under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) for the purpose of making such a change or addition, or may not implement any provision of law requiring the making of such a change or addition, unless the Archivist determines that there is available, by gift or bequest for deposit under paragraph (2) of this subsection in an endowment with respect to such depository, an amount for the purpose of maintaining the land, facility, and equipment of such depository equal to the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount which, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, would have been required to have been available for deposit in such endowment with respect to such depository if such change or addition had been included in such depository on—
<br>
<br>(i) the date on which the Archivist took title to the land, facility, and equipment for such depository under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the date on which the Archivist entered into an agreement for the creation of such depository under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph,
<br>
<br>as the case may be; minus
<br>
<br>(B) the amount which, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, was required to be available for deposit in such endowment with respect to such depository on the date the Archivist took such title or entered into such agreement, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) (to the extent that such paragraphs are inconsistent with this paragraph), this subsection shall be administered in accordance with this paragraph with respect to any Presidential archival depository created as a depository for the papers, documents, and other historical materials and Presidential records pertaining to any President who takes the oath of office as President for the first time on or after July 1, 2002.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraphs (A)(ii), (B)(i)(II), and (B)(ii)(II) of paragraph (3) the percentage of 60 percent shall apply instead of 20 percent.
<br>
<br>(C)(i) In this subparagraph, the term "base endowment amount" means the amount of the endowment required under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) The Archivist may give credits against the base endowment amount if the Archivist determines that the proposed Presidential archival depository will have construction features or equipment that are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to the Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.
<br>
<br>(II) The features and equipment described under subclause (I) shall comply with the standards promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (a)(2).
<br>
<br>(III) The Archivist shall promulgate standards to be used in calculating the dollar amount of any credit to be given, and shall consult with all donors of the endowment before giving any credits. The total dollar amount of credits given under this paragraph may not exceed 20 percent of the base endowment amount.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) In calculating the additional endowment amount required under paragraph (4), the Archivist shall take into account credits given under subparagraph (C), and may also give credits against the additional endowment amount required under paragraph (4), if the Archivist determines that construction features or equipment used in making or equipping the physical or material change or addition are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to the Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.
<br>
<br>(ii) The features and equipment described under clause (i) shall comply with the standards promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (a)(2).
<br>
<br>(iii) The Archivist shall promulgate standards to be used in calculating the dollar amount of any credit to be given, and shall consult with all donors of the endowment before giving any credits. The total dollar amount of credits given under this paragraph may not exceed 20 percent of the additional endowment amount required under paragraph (4).

<br>§2203. Management and custody of Presidential records
<br>
<br>(a) Through the implementation of records management controls and other necessary actions, the President shall take all such steps as may be necessary to assure that the activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of the President's constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately documented and that such records are preserved and maintained as Presidential records pursuant to the requirements of this section and other provisions of law.
<br>
<br>(b) Documentary materials produced or received by the President, the President's staff, or units or individuals in the Executive Office of the President the function of which is to advise or assist the President, shall, to the extent practicable, be categorized as Presidential records or personal records upon their creation or receipt and be filed separately.
<br>
<br>(c) During the President's term of office, the President may dispose of those Presidential records of such President that no longer have administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value if—
<br>
<br>(1) the President obtains the views, in writing, of the Archivist concerning the proposed disposal of such Presidential records; and
<br>
<br>(2) the Archivist states that the Archivist does not intend to take any action under subsection (e) of this section.
<br>
<br>(d) In the event the Archivist notifies the President under subsection (c) that the Archivist does intend to take action under subsection (e), the President may dispose of such Presidential records if copies of the disposal schedule are submitted to the appropriate Congressional Committees at least 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress in advance of the proposed disposal date. For the purpose of this section, continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment of Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in the computation of the days in which Congress is in continuous session.
<br>
<br>(e) The Archivist shall request the advice of the Committee on Rules and Administration and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on House Oversight and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives with respect to any proposed disposal of Presidential records whenever the Archivist considers that—
<br>
<br>(1) these particular records may be of special interest to the Congress; or
<br>
<br>(2) consultation with the Congress regarding the disposal of these particular records is in the public interest.
<br>
<br>(f) During a President's term of office, the Archivist may maintain and preserve Presidential records on behalf of the President, including records in digital or electronic form. The President shall remain exclusively responsible for custody, control, and access to such Presidential records. The Archivist may not disclose any such records, except under direction of the President, until the conclusion of a President's term of office, if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, or such other period provided for under section 2204 of this title.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Upon the conclusion of a President's term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President. The Archivist shall have an affirmative duty to make such records available to the public as rapidly and completely as possible consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) The Archivist shall deposit all such Presidential records in a Presidential archival depository or another archival facility operated by the United States. The Archivist is authorized to designate, after consultation with the former President, a director at each depository or facility, who shall be responsible for the care and preservation of such records.
<br>
<br>(3) When the President considers it practicable and in the public interest, the President shall include in the President's budget transmitted to Congress, for each fiscal year in which the term of office of the President will expire, such funds as may be necessary for carrying out the authorities of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) The Archivist is authorized to dispose of such Presidential records which the Archivist has appraised and determined to have insufficient administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to warrant their continued preservation. Notice of such disposal shall be published in the Federal Register at least 60 days in advance of the proposed disposal date. Publication of such notice shall constitute a final agency action for purposes of review under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.

<br>§2204. Restrictions on access to Presidential records

<br>
<br>(1)(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
<br>
<br>(2) relating to appointments to Federal office;
<br>
<br>(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than sections 552 and 552b of title 5, United States Code), provided that such statute (A) requires that the material be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of material to be withheld;
<br>
<br>(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
<br>
<br>(5) confidential communications requesting or submitting advice, between the President and the President's advisers, or between such advisers; or
<br>
<br>(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Any Presidential record or reasonably segregable portion thereof containing information within a category restricted by the President under subsection (a) shall be so designated by the Archivist and access thereto shall be restricted until the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) the date on which the former President waives the restriction on disclosure of such record, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the expiration of the duration specified under subsection (a) for the category of information on the basis of which access to such record has been restricted; or
<br>
<br>(B) upon a determination by the Archivist that such record or reasonably segregable portion thereof, or of any significant element or aspect of the information contained in such record or reasonably segregable portion thereof, has been placed in the public domain through publication by the former President, or the President's agents.
<br>
<br>(2) Any such record which does not contain information within a category restricted by the President under subsection (a), or contains information within such a category for which the duration of restricted access has expired, shall be exempt from the provisions of subsection (c) until the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date which is 5 years after the date on which the Archivist obtains custody of such record pursuant to section 2203(d)(1); 1 or
<br>
<br>(B) the date on which the Archivist completes the processing and organization of such records or integral file segment thereof.
<br>
<br>(3) During the period of restricted access specified pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the determination whether access to a Presidential record or reasonably segregable portion thereof shall be restricted shall be made by the Archivist, in the Archivist's discretion, after consultation with the former President, and, during such period, such determinations shall not be subject to judicial review, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section. The Archivist shall establish procedures whereby any person denied access to a Presidential record because such record is restricted pursuant to a determination made under this paragraph, may file an administrative appeal of such determination. Such procedures shall provide for a written determination by the Archivist or the Archivist's designee, within 30 working days after receipt of such an appeal, setting forth the basis for such determination.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Subject to the limitations on access imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), Presidential records shall be administered in accordance with section 552 of title 5, United States Code, except that paragraph (b)(5) of that section shall not be available for purposes of withholding any Presidential record, and for the purposes of such section such records shall be deemed to be records of the National Archives and Records Administration. Access to such records shall be granted on nondiscriminatory terms.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to confirm, limit, or expand any constitutionally-based privilege which may be available to an incumbent or former President.
<br>
<br>(d) Upon the death or disability of a President or former President, any discretion or authority the President or former President may have had under this chapter, except section 2208, shall be exercised by the Archivist unless otherwise previously provided by the President or former President in a written notice to the Archivist.
<br>
<br>(e) The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction over any action initiated by the former President asserting that a determination made by the Archivist violates the former President's rights or privileges.
<br>
<br>(f) The Archivist shall not make available any original Presidential records to any individual claiming access to any Presidential record as a designated representative under section 2205(3) of this title if that individual has been convicted of a crime relating to the review, retention, removal, or destruction of records of the Archives.
