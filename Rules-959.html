<br>SUBCHAPTER XV—CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY PROJECT
<br>§80s. Findings; purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight for justice.
<br>
<br>(2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.
<br>
<br>(3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just as important to the cause but who are not as well known.
<br>
<br>(4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an important and tumultuous period.
<br>
<br>(5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights movement so future generations will be able to learn of their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the Nation.
<br>
<br>(6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation projects, and experience in the development of cultural and educational programs for the public.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this subchapter to create a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will coordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon and complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, and to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such individuals so that Americans of all current and future generations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the sacrifices they made.

<br>Short Title
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–19, §1, May 12, 2009, 123 Stat. 1612, provided that: "This Act [enacting this subchapter] may be cited as the 'Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009'."
<br>§80s–1. Establishment of joint project at Library of Congress and National Museum of African American History and Culture to collect video and audio recordings of histories of participants in American Civil Rights movement
<br>(a) Establishment of project
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Within the limits of available funds, the Librarian of Congress (hereafter referred to as the "Librarian") and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (hereafter referred to as the "Secretary)",1 acting jointly, shall establish an oral history project—
<br>
<br>(A) to survey, during the initial phase of the project, collections of audio and video recordings of the reminiscences of participants in the Civil Rights movement that are housed in archives, libraries, museums, and other educational institutions, as well as ongoing documentary work, in order to augment and complement these endeavors and avoid duplication of effort;
<br>
<br>(B) to solicit, reproduce, and collect—
<br>
<br>(i) video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in the Civil Rights movement, and
<br>
<br>(ii) visual and written materials (such as letters, diaries, photographs, and ephemera) relevant to the personal histories of individuals;
<br>
<br>(C) to create a collection of the recordings and other materials obtained, and to catalog and index the collection in a manner the Librarian and the Secretary consider appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(D) to make the collection available for public use through the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, as well as through such other methods as the Librarian and the Secretary consider appropriate.
<br>(2) Role of Director of museum
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall carry out the Secretary's duties under this subchapter through the Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
<br>(b) Use of and consultation with other entities
<br>
<br>The Librarian and the Secretary may carry out the activities described in subsection (a)(1) through agreements and partnerships entered into with other government and private entities, and may otherwise consult with interested persons (within the limits of available resources) and develop appropriate guidelines and arrangements for soliciting, acquiring, and making available recordings under the project under this subchapter.
<br>(c) Services of experts and consultants; acceptance of volunteer services; advance payments
<br>
<br>In carrying out activities described in subsection (a)(1), the Librarian and the Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(1) procure temporary and intermittent services under section 3109 of title 5;
<br>
<br>(2) accept and utilize the services of volunteers and other uncompensated personnel and reimburse them for travel expenses, including per diem, as authorized under section 5703 of title 5; and
<br>
<br>(3) make advances of money and payments in advance in accordance with section 3324 of title 31.
<br>(d) Timing
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after May 12, 2009, the Librarian and the Secretary shall begin collecting video and audio recordings and other materials under subsection (a)(1), and shall attempt to collect the first such recordings from the oldest individuals involved.
<br>(e) Definition
<br>
<br>In this subchapter, the term "Civil Rights movement" means the movement to secure racial equality in the United States for African Americans that, focusing on the period 1954 through 1968, challenged the practice of racial segregation in the Nation and achieved equal rights legislation for all American citizens.

<br>
<br>(1) any funds donated to the Librarian of Congress to support the activities of the Librarian under section 80s–1 of this title shall be deposited entirely into an account established for such purpose;
<br>
<br>(2) the funds contained in such account shall be used solely to support such activities; and

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 111–19, §5, May 12, 2009, 123 Stat. 1615.)
<br>SUBCHAPTER XVI—WOMEN'S HISTORY MUSEUM
<br>§80t. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Since its founding, the United States has greatly benefitted from the contributions of women.
<br>
<br>(2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums disproportionately represent men's achievements and contributions and often neglect those of women. For example—
<br>
<br>(A) a study of 18 United States history textbooks concluded that 10 percent of the material documented contributions of women;
<br>
<br>(B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall depict women; and
<br>
<br>(C) only one of the 44 monuments operated by the National Park Service specifically honors the achievements of women after the 2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument.
<br>
<br>(3) There exists no national museum in the United States that is devoted to the documentation of women's contributions throughout the Nation's history.
<br>
<br>(4) On December 19, 2014, Congress created a Congressional Commission to study the potential for an American museum of women's history. The bipartisan Commission unanimously concluded that the United States needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the United States.
<br>
<br>(5) A comprehensive women's history museum would document the full spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, represent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds, more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add value to the Smithsonian Institution.
<br>
<br>(6) The collections, exhibits, historical narrative materials, and museum programming of the women's history museum should be inclusive, comprehensive, and innovative. Such collections, exhibits, materials, and programming should present the diverse range of experiences and viewpoints of all women in the United States, reflecting upon the things that set women apart from one another while also highlighting the experiences that many of these women share.

<br>§80t–1. Establishment of Museum
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>There is established within the Smithsonian Institution a comprehensive women's history museum, to be named by the Board of Regents in consultation with the council established under section 80t–2 of this title (referred to in this subchapter 1 as the "Museum").
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of the Museum established under this section shall be to provide for—
<br>
<br>(1) the collection and study of, and the establishment of programs relating to, women's contributions to various fields and throughout different periods of history that have influenced the direction of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) collaboration with other Smithsonian Institution museums and facilities, outside museums, and educational institutions; and
<br>
<br>(3) the creation of exhibitions and programs that recognize diverse perspectives on women's history and contributions.

<br>REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 4 OF 1966
<br>Eff. Aug. 23, 1966, 31 F.R. 11137, 80 Stat. 1611
<br>
<br>Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, June 13, 1966, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 203, as amended [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].
<br>NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES
<br>
<br>All those functions of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia which were vested in the municipal architect of the District of Columbia by the provisions of the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 355, 37 Stat. 437 (20 U.S.C. 84; D.C. Code [former] §8–134), in respect of buildings of the National Zoological Park, and all functions of that Board which were vested in the engineer of bridges of the District of Columbia by those provisions in respect of bridges of the National Zoological Park, are hereby transferred to the Smithsonian Institution.
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for a reorganization relating to the National Zoological Park located in the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>Today, all responsibilities for the administration of the park are vested in the Smithsonian Institution with one exception—the function of preparing plans and specifications for the construction of buildings and bridges at the zoo. That statutory responsibility is now conducted by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia [now the Mayor].
<br>
<br>Under the accompanying reorganization plan, the responsibility for the preparation of these plans and specifications would be transferred from the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners to the Smithsonian. The complete administration of the park would then be vested in one agency—the Smithsonian Institution. This will allow the more efficient and effective development and management of the park.
<br>
<br>In 1912, the functions to be transferred were vested in the Municipal Architect of the District of Columbia and in the Engineers of the Bridges of the District of Columbia. In 1952, they were transferred to the Board of Commissioners.
<br>
<br>When the 1912 act was passed, the District of Columbia shared the costs of capital improvements in the National Zoological Park. In 1961, it ceased sharing these costs, and the Federal Government assumed complete responsibility for financing the improvements. Accordingly, the District government retains no capital improvement responsibilities for the National Zoological Park except those functions relating to construction plans and specifications for buildings and bridges, as specified in the 1912 statute. Upon the transfer of these remaining functions to the Smithsonian Institution, the administration of the National Zoological Park will, at last, be fully centered in one agency. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the resulting reduction in expenditures.
<br>
<br>I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.
<br>
<br>I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.
<br>
<br>Lyndon B. Johnson.

<br>The White House, June 13, 1966.
<br>§85. Concessions
<br>(a) Authorization; use of proceeds for research and educational work
<br>
<br>The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, in furtherance of the mission of the National Zoological Park to provide for the advancement of science and instruction and recreation of the people, is authorized to negotiate agreements granting concessions at the National Zoological Park to nonprofit scientific, educational, or historic organizations. The net proceeds of such organizations gained from such concessions granted under this subsection shall be used exclusively for research and educational work for the benefit of the National Zoological Park.
<br>(b) Voluntary services
<br>
<br>The Smithsonian Institution is authorized to accept the voluntary services of such organizations, and the voluntary services of individuals, for the benefit of the National Zoological Park.
