<br>Section was formerly classified to section 61 of this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.
<br>§4575. Gross rate of compensation of employees paid by Secretary of Senate
<br>(a) Annual rate; certification
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the rate of compensation of any employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate is fixed or adjusted on or after October 1, 1980, such rate as so fixed or adjusted shall be at a single whole dollar per annum gross rate and may not include a fractional part of a dollar.
<br>
<br>(2) New or changed rates of compensation (other than changes in rates which are made by law) of any such employee (other than an employee who is an elected officer of the Senate) shall be certified in writing to the Disbursing Office of the Senate (and, for purposes of this paragraph, a new rate of compensation refers to compensation in the case of an appointment, transfer from one Senate appointing authority to another, or promotion by an appointing authority to a position the compensation for which is fixed by law). In the case of an appointment or other new rate of compensation, the certification must be received by such office on or before the day the rate of new compensation is to become effective. In any other case, the changed rate of compensation shall take effect on the first day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received within the first ten days of such month), on the first day of the month after the month in which such certification is received (if the day on which such certification is received is after the twenty-fifth day of the month in which it is received), and on the sixteenth day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received after the tenth day and before the twenty-sixth day of such month). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the certification for a changed rate of compensation for an employee specifies an effective date of such change, such change shall become effective on the date so specified, but only if the date so specified is the first or sixteenth day of a month and is after the effective date prescribed in the preceding sentence; and, notwithstanding such sentence and the preceding provisions of this sentence, any changed rate of compensation for a new employee or an employee transferred from one appointing authority to another shall take effect on the date of such employee's appointment or transfer (as the case may be) if such date is later than the effective date for such changed rate of compensation as prescribed by such sentence.
<br>(b) Conversion; increase in compensation
<br>
<br>The rate of compensation of each employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate which was fixed before August 1, 1967, at a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is payable by law shall be converted as of such date to the lowest per annum gross rate which is a multiple of $180 and which is not less than the aggregate rate of compensation (basic compensation plus additional compensation provided by law) which such employee was receiving immediately prior to such date. Any increments of longevity compensation to which an employee became entitled prior to August 1, 1967, under section 4507(b) of this title shall be excluded in converting such employee's rate of compensation under this subsection, but such employee's rate of gross compensation shall be increased by $540 (which shall be considered to be an increase under section 4507(b) of this title) for each such increment.
<br>(c) Reference in other provisions to basic rates and additional compensation as reference to per annum gross rate
<br>
<br>In any case in which the rate of compensation of any employee or position, or class of employees or positions, the compensation for which is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, or any maximum or minimum rate with respect to any such employee, position, or class, is referred to in or provided by statute or Senate resolution, and the rate so referred to or provided is a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is provided by law, such statutory provision or resolution shall be deemed to refer, in lieu of such basic rate, to the per annum gross rate which an employee receiving such basic rate immediately prior to August 1, 1967, would receive (without regard to such statutory provision or resolution) under subsection (b) on and after such date.
<br>(d) Compensation of employees in office of Senator; limitation; titles of positions
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Except as is otherwise provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the aggregate of gross compensation paid employees in the office of a Senator shall not exceed during each fiscal year the following: 1
<br>
<br>$1,518,333 if the population of the State is less than 5,000,000;
<br>
<br>$1,573,297 if such population is 5,000,000 but less than 6,000,000;

<br>
<br>Section was formerly classified to section 61–1 of this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section. Some section numbers of this title referenced in amendment notes below reflect the classification of such sections prior to their editorial reclassification.

For descriptions of the modifications made to the table that have occurred since 2001, see 2002 and subsequent Amendment notes below.
<br>
<br>The dollar amounts set out in the text of subsecs.

Descriptions of the changes made to the text, both by such Salary Directives and by public laws, can be found in the Amendment notes below.
