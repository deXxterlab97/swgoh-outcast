<br>15Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. 16He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 17He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 18He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 19He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 20He measured it by the four sides; it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.
<br>Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that
<br>looketh toward the east; 2and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth did shine with His glory. 3And the appearance of the vision which I saw was like the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. 4And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the
<br> 
<br>way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. 5And a spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. 6And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me. 7And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, this is the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more defile My holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, and by the carcasses of their kings in their high places; 8in their setting of their threshold by My threshold, and their door-post beside My door-post, and there was but the wall between Me and them; and they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed; wherefore I have consumed them in Mine anger. 9Now let them put away their harlotry, and the carcasses of their kings, far from Me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
<br>10Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure accurately. 11And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof, and write it in their sight; that they
<br> 
<br>may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
<br>12This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
<br>13And these are the measures of the altar by cubits—the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth: the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. 14And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit. 15And the hearth shall be four cubits; and from the hearth and upward there shall be four horns. 16And the hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof. 17And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.’
<br>18And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to dash blood against it. 19Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto Me, to minister unto Me, saith the Lord
<br> 
<br>GOD, a young bullock for a sin- offering. 20And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about; thus shalt thou purify it and make atonement for it. 21Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin- offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 22And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall purify the altar, as they did purify it with the bullock. 23When thou hast made an end of purifying it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 24And thou shalt present them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto the LORD. 25Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin- offering; they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. 26Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so shall they consecrate it. 27And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.’
<br>Then he brought me back the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the
<br> 
<br>east; and it was shut. 2And the LORD said unto me: ‘This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it, for the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut. 3As for the prince, being a prince, he shall sit therein to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.’
<br>4Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD; and I fell upon my face. 5And the LORD said unto me: ‘Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. 6And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, 7in that ye have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, even My house, when ye offer My bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken My covenant, to add unto all your abominations. 8And ye have not kept the charge of My holy things; but ye have set keepers of My charge in My sanctuary to please yourselves.
<br> 
<br>9Thus saith the Lord GOD: No alien, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, even any alien that is among the children of Israel. 10But the Levites, that went far from Me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity; 11and they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. 12Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up My hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity. 13And they shall not come near unto Me, to minister unto Me in the priest’s office, nor to come near to any of My holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. 14And I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
<br>15But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister unto Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer unto Me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD; 16they shall enter into My
<br> 
<br>sanctuary, and they shall come near to My table, to minister unto Me, and they shall keep My charge. 17And it shall be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 18They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. 19And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. 20Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. 21Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 22Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. 23And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. 24And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to Mine ordinances shall they judge it; and they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed seasons, and they shall hallow My sabbaths. 25And they
<br> 
<br>shall come near no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 26And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 27And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord GOD. 28And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. 29The meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, they, even they, shall eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. 30And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every heave-offering of every thing, of all your offerings, shall be for the priests; ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. 31The priests shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
<br>Moreover,	when	ye	shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall set apart an offering unto the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand; it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about. 2Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred in length by five hundred in
<br> 
<br>breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits for the open land round about it. 3And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand; and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. 4It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto the LORD; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a place consecrated for the sanctuary. 5And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, which shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, for twenty chambers. 6And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the offering of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel. 7And for the prince, on the one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border 8of the land; it shall be to him for a possession in Israel, and My princes shall no more wrong My people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
<br> 
<br>9Thus saith the Lord GOD: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel; remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from My people, saith the Lord GOD.
<br>10Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. 11The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer; the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 12And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your maneh.
<br>13This is the offering that ye shall set apart: the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley; 14and the set portion of oil, the bath of oil, shall be the tithe of the bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer; for ten baths are a homer; 15and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well- watered pastures of Israel; for a meal- offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord GOD.
<br>16All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel. 17And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink- offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all the
<br> 
<br>appointed seasons of the house of Israel; he shall prepare the sin- offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace- offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
<br>18Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt purify the sanctuary. 19And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 20And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple; so shall ye make atonement for the house. 21In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover; a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. 22And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering. 23And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he- goat daily for a sin-offering. 24And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 25In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; to the sin-offering
<br> 
<br>as well as the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering as well as the oil.
<br>Thus saith the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that
<br>looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. 2And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace- offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate; then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 3Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 4And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD shall be in the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; 5and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 6And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish; and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish; 7and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as his means suffice, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 8And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the
<br> 
<br>way thereof. 9But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the appointed seasons, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him. 10And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth together. 11And in the feasts and in the appointed seasons the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
<br>12And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto the LORD, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day; then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
<br>13And thou shalt prepare a lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering unto the LORD daily; morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. 14And thou shalt prepare a meal- offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour: a meal-offering unto the LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance.
<br> 
<br>15Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt- offering.
<br>16Thus saith the Lord GOD: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. 17But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. 18Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them wrongfully out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession; that My people be not scattered every man from his possession.’
<br>19Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north; and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. 20And he said unto me: ‘This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt-offering and the sin-offering, where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.’
<br>21Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 22In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed,
<br> 
<br>forty cubits long and thirty broad; these four in the corners were of one measure. 23And there was a row of masonry round about in them, round about the four, and it was made with boiling-places under the rows round about. 24Then said he unto me: ‘These are the boiling-places, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.’
<br>And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and,
<br>behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house looked toward the east; and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. 2Then brought he me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there trickled forth waters on the right side.
<br>3When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. 4Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the loins. 5Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. 6And he said
<br> 
<br>unto me: ‘Hast thou seen this, O son of man?’ Then he led me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
<br>7Now when I had been brought back, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. 8Then said he unto me: ‘These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and when they shall enter into the sea, into the sea of the putrid waters, the waters shall be healed. 9And it shall come to pass, that every living creature wherewith it swarmeth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, that all things be healed and may live whithersoever the river cometh. 10And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it from En-gedi even unto En- eglaim; there shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the Great Sea, exceeding many. 11But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given for salt. 12And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail; it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.’
<br> 
<br>13Thus saith the Lord GOD: ‘This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel, Joseph receiving two portions. 14And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. 15And this shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad; 16Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. 17And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. 18And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, by the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side. 19And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea. This is the south side southward. 20And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.
<br>21So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. 22And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that
<br> 
<br>sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 23And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.
<br>Now these are the names of the tribes: from the north end,
<br>beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus, northward, beside Hamath; and they shall have their sides east and west: Dan, one portion. 2And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side: Asher, one portion. 3And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side: Naphtali, one portion. 4And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side: Manasseh, one portion. 5And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side: Ephraim, one portion. 6And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side: Reuben, one portion. 7And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side: Judah, one portion.
<br>8And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall set aside, five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in
<br> 
<br>the midst of it. 9The offering that ye shall set apart unto the LORD shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in breadth. 10And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering; toward the north five and twenty thousand [in length], and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof. 11The sanctified portion shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, that have kept My charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 12And it shall be unto them a portion set apart from the offering of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites. 13And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth; all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. 14And they shall not sell of it, nor exchange, nor alienate the first portion of the land; for it is holy unto the LORD.
<br>15And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for open land; and the city shall be in the midst thereof. 16And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the
<br> 
<br>south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 17And the city shall have open land: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 18And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy offering, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy offering; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city. 19And they that serve the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 20All the offering shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; ye shall set apart the holy offering foursquare, with the possession of the city.
<br>21And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the five and twenty thousand of the offering toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince; and the holy offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. 22Thus the possession of the Levites, and the possession of the city, shall be in the midst of that which is the prince’s;
<br> 
<br>between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be the prince’s.
<br>23And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side: Benjamin, one portion. 24And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side: Simeon, one portion. 25And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side: Issachar, one portion. 26And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side: Zebulun, one portion. 27And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side: Gad, one portion. 28And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea. 29This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD.
<br> 
<br>30And these are the goings out of the city: on the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure; 31and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one; 32and at the east side four thousand and five hundred reeds; and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one; 33and at the south side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure; and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one; 34at the west side four thousand and five hundred reeds, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one. 35It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.’
<br> 
<br>חושע
<br>HOSEA
<br> 
<br>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in
<br>the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
<br>2When the LORD spoke at first with Hosea, the LORD said unto Hosea: ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry; for the land doth commit great harlotry, departing from the LORD.’ 3So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. 4And the LORD said unto him: ‘Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 5And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.’ 6And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And He said unto him: ‘Call her name aLo-ruhamah; for I will no more have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them. 7But I will have compassion upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow,
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, That hath not obtained compassion.
<br> 
<br>nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.’ 8Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. 9And He said: ‘Call his name bLo-ammi; for ye are not My people, and I will not be yours.’
<br>
<br>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the
<br>sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them: ‘Ye are not My people’, it shall be said unto them: ‘Ye are the children of the living God.’ 2And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel. 3Say ye unto your brethren: ‘cAmmi’; and to your sisters, ‘dRuhamah.’
<br>
<br>4Plead with your mother, plead;
<br>For she is not My wife, neither am I her husband;
<br>And let her put away her harlotries from her face,
<br>
<br>
<br>b That is, Not My people.
<br>c That is, My people.
<br>d   That   is,	That hath obtained compassion.
<br> 
<br>And her adulteries from between her breasts;
<br>5Lest I strip her naked,
<br>And set her as in the day that she was born,
<br>And make her as a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst.
<br>6And I will not have compassion upon her children;
<br>For they are children of harlotry.
<br>7For their mother hath played the harlot,
<br>She that conceived them hath done shamefully;
<br>For she said: ‘I will go after my lovers,
<br>That give me my bread and my water,
<br>My wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.’
<br>8Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns,
<br>And I will make a wall against her, That she shall not find her paths.
<br>9And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them,
<br>And she shall seek them, but shall not find them;
<br>Then shall she say: ‘I will go and return to my first husband;
<br>For then was it better with me than now.’
<br>10For she did not know that it was I that gave her
<br>The corn, and the wine, and the oil,
<br>And multiplied unto her silver and gold,
<br>Which they used for Baal.
<br> 
<br>11Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof,
<br>And My wine in the season thereof, And will snatch away My wool and
<br>My flax
<br>Given to cover her nakedness.
<br>12And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers,
<br>And none shall deliver her out of My hand.
<br>13I will also cause all her mirth to cease,
<br>Her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths,
<br>And all her appointed seasons.
<br>14And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees,
<br>Whereof she hath said: ‘These are my hire
<br>That my lovers have given me’; And I will make them a forest,
<br>And the beasts of the field shall eat them.
<br>15And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim,
<br>Wherein she offered unto them, And decked herself with her ear-
<br>rings and her jewels, And went after her lovers,
<br>And forgot Me, saith the LORD.
<br>16Therefore, behold, I will allure her,
<br>And bring her into the wilderness, And speak tenderly unto her.
<br>17And I will give her her vineyards from thence,
<br> 
<br>And the valley of aAchor for a door of hope;
<br>And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth,
<br>And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>18And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD,
<br>That thou shalt call Me bIshi,
<br>And shalt call Me no more cBaali. 19For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth,
<br>And they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
<br>20And in that day will I make a covenant for them
<br>With the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven,
<br>And with the creeping things of the ground;
<br>And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land,
<br>And will make them to lie down safely.
<br>21And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever;
<br>Yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice,
<br>And in lovingkindness, and in compassion.
<br>22And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness;
<br>And thou shalt know the LORD.
<br>
<br>a That is, Troubling.
<br>b That is, My husband.
<br>c That is, My master.
<br> 
<br>23And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens,
<br>And they shall respond to the earth; 24And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; And they shall respond to dJezreel.
<br>25And I will sow her unto Me in the land;
<br>And I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion;
<br>And I will say to them that were not My people: ‘Thou art My people’;
<br>And they shall say: ‘Thou art my God.’
<br>
<br>And the LORD said unto me: ‘Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins. 2So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; 3and I said unto her: ‘Thou shalt sit solitary for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife; nor will I be thine.’ 4For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice,	and	without	pillar,	and without ephod or teraphim; 5afterward shall the children of Israel return, and
<br>
<br>d That is, Whom God soweth.
<br> 
<br>seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto the LORD and to His goodness in the end of days.
<br>
<br>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel!
<br>For the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land,
<br>Because there is no truth, nor mercy, Nor knowledge of God in the land. 2Swearing and lying, and killing,
<br>and stealing, and committing adultery!
<br>They break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood.
<br>3Therefore doth the land mourn,
<br>And every one that dwelleth therein doth languish,
<br>With the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven;
<br>Yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away.
<br>
<br>4Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove;
<br>For thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
<br>5Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day,
<br>And the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night;
<br>And I will destroy thy mother.
<br>6My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;
<br>Because thou hast rejected knowledge,
<br>I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me;
<br> 
<br>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God,
<br>I also will forget thy children.
<br>
<br>7The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me;
<br>I will change their glory into shame. 8They feed on the sin of My people, And set their heart on their iniquity. 9And it is like people, like priest; And I will punish him for his ways,
<br>And will recompense him his doings.
<br>10And they shall eat, and not have enough,
<br>They shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase;
<br>Because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
<br>11Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart.
<br>12My people ask counsel at their stock,
<br>And their staff declareth unto them;
<br>For the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err,
<br>And they have gone astray from under their God.
<br>13They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains,
<br>And offer upon the hills,
<br>Under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
<br>Because the shadow thereof is good;
<br>Therefore your daughters commit harlotry,
<br>And your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
<br> 
<br>14I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry,
<br>Nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery;
<br>For they themselves consort with lewd women,
<br>And they sacrifice with harlots; And the people that is without understanding is distraught.
<br>
<br>15Though thou, Israel, play the harlot,
<br>Yet let not Judah become guilty; And come not ye unto Gilgal, Neither go ye up to Beth-aven, Nor swear: ‘As the LORD liveth.’ 16For Israel is stubborn like a
<br>stubborn heifer;
<br>Now shall the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place?
<br>17Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.
<br>18When their carouse is over, They take to harlotry;
<br>Her rulers deeply love dishonour.
<br>19The wind hath bound her up in her skirts;
<br>And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
<br>
<br>Hear this, O ye priests,
<br>And attend, ye house of Israel, And give ear, O house of the king,
<br>For unto you pertaineth the judgment;
<br>For ye have been a snare on Mizpah, And a net spread upon Tabor.
<br>2And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter;
<br> 
<br>And I am rejected of them all. 3I, even I, know Ephraim, And Israel is not hid from Me;
<br>For now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry,
<br>Israel is defiled.
<br>4Their doings will not suffer them To return unto their God;
<br>For the spirit of harlotry is within them,
<br>And they know not the LORD.
<br>5But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face;
<br>And Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity,
<br>Judah also shall stumble with them.
<br>6With their flocks and with their herds they shall go
<br>To seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him;
<br>He hath withdrawn Himself from them.
<br>7They have dealt treacherously against the LORD,
<br>For they have begotten strange children;
<br>Now shall the new moon devour them with their portions.
<br>
<br>8Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, And the trumpet in Ramah; Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: ‘Behind thee, O Benjamin! ’ 9Ephraim shall be desolate in the
<br>day of rebuke;
<br>Among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be.
<br> 
<br>10The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark;
<br>I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.
<br>11Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right;
<br>Because he willingly walked after filth.
<br>12Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth,
<br>And to the house of Judah as rottenness.
<br>13And when Ephraim saw his sickness,
<br>And Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria,
<br>And sent to King Contentious; But he is not able to heal you,
<br>Neither shall he cure you of your wound.
<br>14For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion,
<br>And as a young lion to the house of Judah;
<br>I, even I, will tear and go away,
<br>I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver.
<br>15I will go and return to My place, Till they acknowledge their guilt,
<br>and seek My face;
<br>In their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:
<br>’Come, and let us return unto the LORD;
<br>For He hath torn, and He will heal us,
<br>He hath smitten, and He will bind us up.
<br>2After two days will He revive us,
<br> 
<br>On the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.
<br>3And let us know, eagerly strive to know the LORD,
<br>His going forth is sure as the morning;
<br>And He shall come unto us as the rain,
<br>As the latter rain that watereth the earth.’
<br>
<br>4O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee?
<br>O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?
<br>For your goodness is as a morning cloud,
<br>And as the dew that early passeth away.
<br>5Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets,
<br>I have slain them by the words of My mouth;
<br>And thy judgment goeth forth as the light.
<br>6For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,
<br>And the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings.
<br>
<br>7But they like men have transgressed the covenant;
<br>There have they dealt treacherously against Me.
<br>8Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity,
<br>It is covered with footprints of blood.
<br>9And as troops of robbers wait for a man,
<br> 
<br>So doth the company of priests; They murder in the way toward
<br>Shechem;
<br>Yea, they commit enormity.
<br>10In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;
<br>There harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
<br>11Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee!
<br>
<br>When I would turn the captivity of My people,
<br>When I would heal Israel,
<br>Then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered,
<br>And the wickedness of Samaria, For they commit falsehood; And the thief entereth in,
<br>And the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.
<br>2And let them not say to their heart—
<br>I remember all their wickedness;
<br>Now their own doings have beset them about,
<br>They are before My face.
<br>3They make the king glad with their wickedness,
<br>And the princes with their lies.
<br>4They are all adulterers,
<br>As an oven heated by the baker, Who ceaseth to stir
<br>From the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.
<br>5On the day of our king
<br>The princes make him sick with the heat of wine,
<br> 
<br>He stretcheth out his hand with scorners.
<br>6For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait;
<br>Their baker sleepeth all the night,
<br>In the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
<br>7They are all hot as an oven, And devour their judges; All their kings are fallen,
<br>There is none among them that calleth unto Me.
<br>
<br>8Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples;
<br>Ephraim is become a cake not turned.
<br>9Strangers have devoured his strength,
<br>And he knoweth it not;
<br>Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him,
<br>And he knoweth it not.
<br>10And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face;
<br>But they have not returned unto the LORD their God,
<br>Nor sought Him, for all this.
<br>11And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding;
<br>They call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.
<br>12Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them;
<br>I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven;
<br> 
<br>I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear.
<br>13Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me;
<br>Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me;
<br>Shall I then redeem them,
<br>Seeing they have spoken lies against Me?
<br>14And they have not cried unto Me with their heart,
<br>Though they wail upon their beds;
<br>They assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.
<br>15Though I have trained and strengthened their arms,
<br>Yet do they devise evil against Me.
<br>16They return, but not upwards;
<br>They are become like a deceitful bow;
<br>Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue;
<br>This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>Set the horn to thy mouth.
<br>As a vulture he cometh against the house of the LORD;
<br>Because they have transgressed My covenant,
<br>And trespassed against My law.
<br>2Will they cry unto Me:
<br>‘My God, we Israel know Thee’?
<br>3Israel hath cast off that which is good;
<br>The enemy shall pursue him.
<br>4They have set up kings, but not from Me,
<br> 
<br>They have made princes, and I knew it not;
<br>Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols,
<br>That they may be cut off.
<br>5Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; Mine anger is kindled against them;
<br>How long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
<br>6For from Israel is even this:
<br>The craftsman made it, and it is no God;
<br>Yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in shivers.
<br>7For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind;
<br>It hath no stalk, the bud that shall yield no meal;
<br>If so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
<br>
<br>8Israel is swallowed up;
<br>Now are they become among the nations
<br>As a vessel wherein is no value. 9For they are gone up to Assyria, Like a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath hired lovers.
<br>10Yea, though they hire among the nations,
<br>Now will I gather them up; And they begin to be minished
<br>By reason of the burden of king and princes.
<br>11For Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin,
<br>Yea, altars have been unto him to sin.
<br> 
<br>12Though I write for him never so many things of My Law,
<br>They are accounted as a stranger’s.
<br>13As for the sacrifices that are made by fire unto Me,
<br>Let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, For the LORD accepteth them not.
<br>Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins;
<br>They shall return to Egypt.
<br>14For Israel hath forgotten his Maker,
<br>And builded palaces,
<br>And Judah hath multiplied fortified cities;
<br>But I will send a fire upon his cities,
<br>And it shall devour the castles thereof.
<br>
<br>Rejoice not, O Israel, unto exultation, like the peoples,
<br>For thou hast gone astray from thy God,
<br>Thou hast loved a harlot’s hire upon every corn-floor.
<br>2The threshing-floor and the wine- press shall not feed them,
<br>And the new wine shall fail her.
<br>3They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land;
<br>But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And they shall eat unclean food in
<br>Assyria.
<br>4They shall not pour out wine- offerings to the LORD,
<br>Neither shall they be pleasing unto Him;
<br>Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners,
<br> 
<br>All that eat thereof shall be polluted;
<br>For their bread shall be for their appetite,
<br>It shall not come into the house of the LORD.
<br>5What will ye do in the day of the appointed season,
<br>And in the day of the feast of the LORD?
<br>6For, lo, they are gone away from destruction,
<br>Yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them;
<br>Their precious treasures of silver, nettles shall possess them,
<br>Thorns shall be in their tents.
<br>7The days of visitation are come, The days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it.
<br>The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad!
<br>For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great.
<br>8Ephraim is a watchman with my God;
<br>As for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways,
<br>And enmity in the house of his God.
<br>9They have deeply corrupted themselves,
<br>As in the days of Gibeah;
<br>He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.
<br>
<br>10I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness,
<br>I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season;
<br> 
<br>But so soon as they came to Baal- peor,
<br>They separated themselves unto the shameful thing,
<br>And became detestable like that which they loved.
<br>11As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird;
<br>There shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception. 12Yea, though they bring up their
<br>children,
<br>Yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left;
<br>Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
<br>13Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place;
<br>But Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer.
<br>14Give them, O LORD, whatsoever Thou wilt give;
<br>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
<br>15All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them;
<br>Because of the wickedness of their doings
<br>I will drive them out of My house; I will love them no more,
<br>All their princes are rebellious.
<br>16Ephraim is smitten, Their root is dried up, They shall bear no fruit;
<br>Yea, though they bring forth,
<br>Yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.
<br>17My God will cast them away,
<br> 
<br>Because they did not hearken unto Him;
<br>And they shall be wanderers among the nations.
<br>
<br>Israel was a luxuriant vine, Which put forth fruit freely:
<br>As his fruit increased, He increased his altars;
<br>The more goodly his land was, The more goodly were his pillars. 2Their heart is divided;
<br>Now shall they bear their guilt; He will break down their altars, He will spoil their pillars.
<br>3Surely now shall they say: ‘We have no king;
<br>For we feared not the LORD;
<br>And the king, what can he do for us?’
<br>4They speak words,
<br>They swear falsely, they make covenants;
<br>Thus judgment springeth up as hemlock
<br>In the furrows of the field.
<br>5The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread
<br>For the calves of Beth-aven;
<br>For the people thereof shall mourn over it,
<br>And the priests thereof shall tremble for it,
<br>For its glory, because it is departed from it.
<br>6It also shall be carried unto Assyria,
<br>For a present to King Contentious; Ephraim shall receive shame,
<br> 
<br>And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
<br>7As for Samaria, her king is cut off, As foam upon the water.
<br>8The high places also of Aven shall be destroyed,
<br>Even the sin of Israel.
<br>The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars;
<br>And they shall say to the mountains: ‘Cover us’,
<br>And to the hills: ‘Fall on us.’
<br>
<br>9From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel;
<br>There they stood;
<br>No battle was to overtake them in Gibeah,
<br>Nor the children of arrogancy.
<br>10When it is My desire, I will chastise them;
<br>And the peoples shall be gathered against them,
<br>When they are yoked to their two rings.
<br>11And Ephraim is a heifer well broken,
<br>That loveth to thresh,
<br>And I have passed over upon her fair neck;
<br>I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow,
<br>Jacob shall break his clods.
<br>12Sow to yourselves according to righteousness,
<br>Reap according to mercy, Break up your fallow ground; For it is time to seek the LORD,
<br> 
<br>Till He come and cause righteousness to rain upon you.
<br>13Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity,
<br>Ye have eaten the fruit of lies; For thou didst trust in thy way,
<br>In the multitude of thy mighty men.
<br>14Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy hosts,
<br>And all thy fortresses shall be spoiled,
<br>As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle;
<br>The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
<br>15So hath Beth-el done unto you Because of your great wickedness;
<br>At daybreak is the king of Israel utterly cut off.
<br>
<br>When Israel was a child, then I loved him,
<br>And out of Egypt I called My son.
<br>2The more they called them, the more they went from them; They sacrificed unto the Baalim,
<br>And offered to graven images. 3And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms;
<br>But they knew not that I healed them.
<br>4I drew them with cords of a man, With bands of love;
<br>And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws,
<br>And I fed them gently.
<br>5He shall not return into the land of Egypt,
<br>But the Assyrian shall be his king,
<br> 
<br>Because they refused to return.
<br>6And the sword shall fall upon his cities,
<br>And shall consume his bars, and devour them,
<br>Because of their own counsels.
<br>
<br>7And My people are in suspense about returning to Me;
<br>And though they call them upwards, None at all will lift himself up.
<br>8How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim?
<br>My heart is turned within Me,
<br>My compassions are kindled together.
<br>9I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger,
<br>I will not return to destroy Ephraim; For I am God, and not man,
<br>The Holy One in the midst of thee; And I will not come in fury.
<br>10They shall walk after the LORD, Who shall roar like a lion;
<br>For He shall roar,
<br>And the children shall come trembling from the west.
<br>11They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt,
<br>And as a dove out of the land of Assyria;
<br>And I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Ephraim compasseth Me about with lies,
<br>And the house of Israel with deceit;
<br> 
<br>And Judah is yet wayward towards God,
<br>And towards the Holy One who is faithful.
<br>2Ephraim striveth after wind, and followeth after the east wind;
<br>All the day he multiplieth lies and desolation;
<br>And they make a covenant with Assyria,
<br>And oil is carried into Egypt.
<br>3The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah,
<br>And will punish Jacob according to his ways,
<br>According to his doings will He recompense him.
<br>4In the womb he took his brother by the heel,
<br>And by his strength he strove with a godlike being;
<br>5So he strove with an angel, and prevailed;
<br>He wept, and made supplication unto him;
<br>At Beth-el he would find him, And there he would speak with us; 6But the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name.
<br>7Therefore turn thou to thy God; Keep mercy and justice,
<br>And wait for thy God continually.
<br>8As for the trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand.
<br>He loveth to oppress.
<br>9And Ephraim said: ‘Surely I am become rich,
<br>I have found me wealth;
<br> 
<br>In all my labours they shall find in me
<br>No iniquity that were sin.’ 10But I am the LORD thy God From the land of Egypt;
<br>I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents,
<br>As in the days of the appointed season.
<br>11I have also spoken unto the prophets,
<br>And I have multiplied visions;
<br>And by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.
<br>12If Gilead be given to iniquity Becoming altogether vanity,
<br>In Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks;
<br>Yea, their altars shall be as heaps In the furrows of the field.
<br>
<br>13And Jacob fled into the field of Aram,
<br>And Israel served for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep.
<br>14And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt,
<br>And by a prophet was he kept.
<br>15Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly;
<br>Therefore shall his blood be cast upon him,
<br>And his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
<br>
<br>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling,
<br>He exalted himself in Israel;
<br> 
<br>But when he became guilty through Baal, he died.
<br>2And now they sin more and more,
<br>And have made them molten images of their silver,
<br>According to their own understanding, even idols,
<br>All of them the work of the craftsmen;
<br>Of them they say:
<br>‘They that sacrifice men kiss calves.’
<br>3Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud,
<br>And as the dew that early passeth away,
<br>As the chaff that is driven with the wind out of the threshing-floor,
<br>And as the smoke out of the window.
<br>
<br>4Yet I am the LORD thy God From the land of Egypt;
<br>And thou knowest no God but Me, And beside Me there is no saviour. 5I did know thee in the wilderness, In the land of great drought.
<br>6When they were fed, they became full,
<br>They were filled, and their heart was exalted;
<br>Therefore have they forgotten Me.
<br>7Therefore am I become unto them as a lion;
<br>As a leopard will I watch by the way;
<br>8I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps,
<br> 
<br>And will rend the enclosure of their heart;
<br>And there will I devour them like a lioness;
<br>The wild beast shall tear them.
<br>
<br>9It is thy destruction, O Israel,
<br>That thou art against Me, against thy help.
<br>10Ho, now, thy king,
<br>That he may save thee in all thy cities!
<br>And thy judges, of whom thou saidst:
<br>‘Give me a king and princes! ’
<br>11I give thee a king in Mine anger, And take him away in My wrath.
<br>
<br>12The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up;
<br>His sin is laid up in store.
<br>13The throes of a travailing woman shall come upon him;
<br>He is an unwise son;
<br>For it is time he should not tarry
<br>In the place of the breaking forth of children.
<br>14Shall I ransom them from the power of the nether-world?
<br>Shall I redeem them from death? Ho, thy plagues, O death!
<br>Ho, thy destruction, O netherworld! Repentance be hid from Mine eyes! 15For though he be fruitful among
<br>the reed-plants,
<br>An east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness,
<br> 
<br>And his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up;
<br>He shall spoil the treasure of all precious vessels.
<br>
<br>Samaria shall bear her guilt,
<br>For she hath rebelled against her God;
<br>They shall fall by the sword;
<br>Their infants shall be dashed in pieces,
<br>And their women with child shall be ripped up.
<br>2Return, O Israel, unto the LORD thy God;
<br>For thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity.
<br>3Take with you words, And return unto the LORD;
<br>Say unto Him: ‘Forgive all iniquity, And accept that which is good;
<br>So will we render for bullocks the offering of our lips.
<br>4Asshur shall not save us; We will not ride upon horses;
<br>Neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods;
<br>For in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.’
<br>5I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely;
<br>For Mine anger is turned away from him.
<br>6I will be as the dew unto Israel; He shall blossom as the lily,
<br>And cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
<br>7His branches shall spread,
<br>And his beauty shall be as the olive- tree,
<br> 
<br>And his fragrance as Lebanon.
<br>8They that dwell under his shadow shall again
<br>Make corn to grow,
<br>And shall blossom as the vine;
<br>The scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
<br>9Ephraim [shall say]:
<br>‘What have I to do any more with idols?’
<br>As for Me, I respond and look on him;
<br> 
<br>I am like a leafy cypress-tree; From Me is thy fruit found.
<br>10Whoso is wise, let him understand these things,
<br>Whoso is prudent, let him know them.
<br>For the ways of the LORD are right, And the just do walk in them;
<br>But transgressors do stumble therein.
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>יואל
<br>JOEL
<br> 
<br>The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
<br>
<br>2Hear this, ye old men,
<br>And give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
<br>Hath this been in your days, Or in the days of your fathers? 3Tell ye your children of it,
<br>And let your children tell their children,
<br>And their children another generation.
<br>4That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten;
<br>And that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten;
<br>And that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
<br> 
<br>5Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, And wail, all ye drinkers of wine, Because of the sweet wine,
<br>For it is cut off from your mouth.
<br>6For a people is come up upon my land,
<br>Mighty, and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
<br>And he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
<br>7He hath laid my vine waste, And blasted my fig-tree;
<br>He hath made it clean bare, and cast it down,
<br>The branches thereof are made white.
<br>
<br>8Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth
<br> 
<br>For the husband of her youth.
<br>9The meal-offering and the drink- offering is cut off
<br>From the house of the LORD; The priests mourn,
<br>Even the LORD’S ministers.
<br>10The field is wasted, The land mourneth; For the corn is wasted,
<br>The new wine is dried up, The oil languisheth.
<br>11Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, Wail, O ye vinedressers,
<br>For the wheat and for the barley;
<br>Because the harvest of the field is perished.
<br>12The vine is withered,
<br>And the fig-tree languisheth;
<br>The pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree,
<br>Even all the trees of the field, are withered;
<br>For joy is withered away from the sons of men.
<br>
<br>13Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests,
<br>Wail, ye ministers of the altar; Come, lie all night in sackcloth, Ye ministers of my God;
<br>For the meal-offering and the drink- offering is withholden
<br>From the house of your God.
<br>14Sanctify ye a fast, Call a solemn assembly, Gather the elders
<br>And all the inhabitants of the land Unto the house of the LORD your
<br>God,
<br> 
<br>And cry unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>15Alas for the day!
<br>For the day of the LORD is at hand, And as a destruction from the
<br>Almighty shall it come.
<br>16Is not the food cut off Before our eyes,
<br>Yea, joy and gladness
<br>From the house of our God?
<br>17The grains shrivel under their hoes;
<br>The garners are laid desolate, The barns are broken down; For the corn is withered.
<br>18How do the beasts groan!
<br>The herds of cattle are perplexed, Because they have no pasture;
<br>Yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
<br>19Unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry; For the fire hath devoured
<br>The pastures of the wilderness, And the flame hath set ablaze All the trees of the field.
<br>20Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto Thee;
<br>For the water brooks are dried up,
<br>And the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
<br>
<br>Blow ye the horn in Zion,
<br>And sound an alarm in My holy mountain;
<br>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble;
<br>For the day of the LORD cometh, For it is at hand;
<br>2A day of darkness and gloominess,
<br> 
<br>A day of clouds and thick darkness,
<br>As blackness spread upon the mountains;
<br>A great people and a mighty, There hath not been ever the like,
<br>Neither shall be any more after them,
<br>Even to the years of many generations.
<br>3A fire devoureth before them, And behind them a flame blazeth;
<br>The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
<br>And behind them a desolate wilderness;
<br>Yea, and nothing escapeth them.
<br>
<br>4The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses;
<br>And as horsemen, so do they run.
<br>5Like the noise of chariots,
<br>On the tops of the mountains do they leap,
<br>Like the noise of a flame of fire That devoureth the stubble,
<br>As a mighty people set in battle array.
<br>6At their presence the peoples are in anguish;
<br>All faces have gathered blackness.
<br>7They run like mighty men,
<br>They climb the wall like men of war;
<br>And they move on every one in his ways,
<br>And they entangle not their paths.
<br>8Neither doth one thrust another,
<br>They march every one in his highway;
<br> 
<br>And they break through the weapons,
<br>And suffer no harm. 9They leap upon the city, They run upon the wall,
<br>They climb up into the houses;
<br>They enter in at the windows like a thief.
<br>10Before them the earth quaketh, The heavens tremble;
<br>The sun and the moon are become black,
<br>And the stars withdraw their shining.
<br>11And the LORD uttereth His voice before His army;
<br>For His camp is very great,
<br>For he is mighty that executeth His word;
<br>For great is the day of the LORD and very terrible;
<br>And who can abide it?
<br>
<br>12Yet even now, saith the LORD, Turn ye unto Me with all your heart, And with fasting, and with weeping,
<br>and with lamentation;
<br>13And rend your heart, and not your garments,
<br>And turn unto the LORD your God;
<br>For He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy,
<br>And repenteth Him of the evil.
<br>14Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent,
<br>And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a meal-offering and a drink-
<br>offering
<br> 
<br>Unto the LORD your God?
<br>
<br>15Blow the horn in Zion,
<br>Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;
<br>16Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children,
<br>And those that suck the breasts;
<br>Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber,
<br>And the bride out of her pavilion.
<br>17Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD,
<br>Weep between the porch and the altar,
<br>And let them say: ‘Spare thy people, O LORD,
<br>And give not Thy heritage to reproach,
<br>That the nations should make them a byword:
<br>Wherefore should they say among the peoples:
<br>Where is their God?’
<br>18Then was the LORD jealous for His land,
<br>And had pity on His people.
<br>19And the LORD answered and said unto His people:
<br>‘Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil,
<br>And ye shall be satisfied therewith;
<br>And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;
<br>20But I will remove far off from you the northern one,
<br> 
<br>And will drive him into a land barren and desolate,
<br>With his face toward the eastern sea,
<br>And his hinder part toward the western sea;
<br>That his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up,
<br>Because he hath done great things.’
<br>
<br>21Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice;
<br>For the LORD hath done great things.
<br>22Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field;
<br>For the pastures of the wilderness do spring,
<br>For the tree beareth its fruit,
<br>The fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
<br>23Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice
<br>In the LORD your God;
<br>For He giveth you the former rain in just measure,
<br>And He causeth to come down for you the rain,
<br>The former rain and the latter rain, at the first.
<br>24And the floors shall be full of corn,
<br>And the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
<br>25And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,
<br>The canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer-worm,
<br>My great army which I sent among you.
<br> 
<br>26And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
<br>And shall praise the name of the LORD your God,
<br>That hath dealt wondrously with you;
<br>And My people shall never be ashamed.
<br>27And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,
<br>And that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else;
<br>And My people shall never be ashamed.
<br>
<br>And it shall come to pass afterward,
<br>That I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh;
<br>And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
<br>Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions; 2And also upon the servants and
<br>upon the handmaids
<br>In those days will I pour out My spirit.
<br>3And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
<br>Blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
<br>4The sun shall be turned into darkness,
<br>And the moon into blood,
<br>Before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.
<br>5And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered;
<br> 
<br>For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape,
<br>As the LORD hath said,
<br>And among the remnant those whom the LORD shall call.
<br>
<br>For, behold, in those days, and in that time,
<br>When I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
<br>2I will gather all nations,
<br>And will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;
<br>And I will enter into judgment with them there
<br>For My people and for My heritage Israel,
<br>Whom they have scattered among the nations,
<br>And divided My land.
<br>3And they have cast lots for My people;
<br>And have given a boy for an harlot,
<br>And sold a girl for wine, and have drunk.
<br>
<br>4And also what are ye to Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render retribution on My behalf? and if ye render retribution on My behalf, swiftly, speedily will I return your retribution upon your own head. 5Forasmuch as ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My goodly treasures; 6the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of Jevanim, that ye might remove them far from their
<br> 
<br>border; 7behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your retribution upon your own head; 8and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off; for the LORD hath spoken.
<br>
<br>9Proclaim ye this among the nations, Prepare war;
<br>Stir up the mighty men;
<br>Let all the men of war draw near, Let them come up.
<br>10Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning-hooks into spears; Let the weak say: ‘I am strong.’ 11Haste ye, and come, all ye nations
<br>round about,
<br>And gather yourselves together;
<br>Thither cause Thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD!
<br>12Let the nations be stirred up, and come up
<br>To the valley of aJehoshaphat; For there will I sit to judge All the nations round about. 13Put ye in the sickle,
<br>For the harvest is ripe; Come, tread ye,
<br>For the winepress is full, the vats overflow;
<br>For their wickedness is great.
<br>
<br>14Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!
<br>
<br>a That is, The Lord judgeth.
<br> 
<br>For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
<br>15The sun and the moon are become black,
<br>And the stars withdraw their shining.
<br>16And the LORD shall roar from Zion, And utter His voice from Jerusalem,
<br>And the heavens and the earth shall shake;
<br>But the LORD will be a refuge unto His people,
<br>And a stronghold to the children of Israel.
<br>17So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God,
<br>Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain;
<br>Then shall Jerusalem be holy,
<br>And there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
<br>
<br>18And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine,
<br>And the hills shall flow with milk,
<br>And all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters;
<br>And a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD,
<br>And shall water the valley of Shittim.
<br>19Egypt shall be a desolation,
<br>And Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,
<br>For the violence against the children of Judah,
<br> 
<br>Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
<br>20But Judah shall be inhabited for ever,
<br>And Jerusalem from generation to generation.
<br> 
<br>21And I will hold as innocent their blood that I have not held as innocent;
<br>And the LORD dwelleth in Zion.
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>עמוס
<br>AMOS
<br> 
<br>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen   of   Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the
<br>earthquake.
<br>
<br>2And he said:
<br>The LORD roareth from Zion, And uttereth His voice from
<br>Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
<br>
<br>3For thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have threshed Gilead with sledges of iron.
<br>4So will I send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad;
<br>5And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from Bikath-Aven, and
<br> 
<br>him that holdeth the sceptre from Beth-eden; and the people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>6Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they carried away captive a whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom.
<br>7So will I send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof;
<br>8And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn My hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.
<br>
<br>9Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they delivered up a whole
<br> 
<br>captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant.
<br>10So will I send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
<br>
<br>11Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever.
<br>12So will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
<br>
<br>13Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.
<br>14So will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
<br>15And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>For three transgressions of Moab, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it:
<br>Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.
<br> 
<br>2So will I send a fire upon Moab, And it shall devour the palaces of
<br>Kerioth;
<br>And Moab shall die with tumult,
<br>With shouting, and with the sound of the horn;
<br>3And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof,
<br>And will slay all the princes thereof with him,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>4Thus saith the LORD:
<br>For three transgressions of Judah, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it:
<br>Because they have rejected the law of the LORD,
<br>And have not kept His statutes,
<br>And their lies have caused them to err,
<br>After which their fathers did walk. 5So will I send a fire upon Judah, And it shall devour the palaces of
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>6Thus saith the LORD:
<br>For three transgressions of Israel, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it:
<br>Because they sell the righteous for silver,
<br>And the needy for a pair of shoes;
<br>7That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
<br>And turn aside the way of the humble;
<br>And a man and his father go unto the same maid,
<br>To profane My holy name;
<br> 
<br>8And they lay themselves down beside every altar
