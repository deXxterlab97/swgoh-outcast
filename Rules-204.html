<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a phased retiree does not make such a deposit and dies in service as a phased retiree, a survivor of the phased retiree shall have the same right to make such deposit as would have been available had the employee not entered phased retirement status and died in service.

<br>
<br>(e) Under such procedures as the Director may prescribe, a phased retiree may elect to enter full retirement status at any time. Upon making such an election, a phased retiree shall be entitled to a composite retirement annuity.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) Except as provided otherwise under this subsection, a composite retirement annuity is a single annuity computed under regulations prescribed by the Director, equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the phased retirement annuity as of the date of full retirement, before any reduction based on an election under section 8334(d)(2), and including any adjustments made under section 8340; and
<br>
<br>(B) the product obtained by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of an annuity computed under section 8339 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected a phased retirement and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any reduction for survivor annuity or reduction based on an election under section 8334(d)(2); by
<br>
<br>(ii) the working percentage.
<br>
<br>(2) After computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1), the Director shall adjust the amount of the annuity for any applicable reductions for a survivor annuity and any previously elected actuarial reduction under section 8334(d)(2).
<br>
<br>(3) A composite retirement annuity shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8340, except that subsection (c)(1) of that section shall not apply.
<br>
<br>(4) In computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the unused sick leave to the credit of a phased retiree at the time of entry into full retirement status shall be adjusted by dividing the number of hours of unused sick leave by the working percentage.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Under such procedures and conditions as the Director may provide, and with the concurrence of the head of the employing agency, a phased retiree may elect to terminate phased retirement status and return to a full-time work schedule.

<br>
<br>(3) After the termination of a phased retirement annuity under this subsection, the individual's rights under this subchapter shall be determined based on the law in effect at the time of any subsequent separation from service. For purposes of this subchapter or chapter 84, at time of the subsequent separation from service, the phased retirement period shall be treated as if it had been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2).
<br>
<br>(h) For purposes of section 8341—
<br>
<br>(1) the death of a phased retiree shall be deemed to be the death in service of an employee; and
<br>
<br>(2) the phased retirement period shall be deemed to have been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2).
<br>
<br>(i) Employment of a phased retiree shall not be deemed to be part-time career employment, as defined in section 3401(2).
<br>
<br>(j) A phased retiree is not eligible to apply for an annuity under section 8337.
<br>
<br>(k) For purposes of section 8341(h)(4), retirement shall be deemed to occur on the date on which a phased retiree enters into full retirement status.
<br>
