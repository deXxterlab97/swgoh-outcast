<br>And thou hast said in thy heart.
<br>’I am, and there is none else beside me.’
<br>11Yet shall evil came upon thee;
<br>Thou shalt not know how to charm it away;
<br>And calamity shall fall upon thee;
<br>Thou shalt not be able to put it away;
<br>And ruin shall come upon thee suddenly,
<br>Before thou knowest.
<br>
<br>12Stand now with thine enchantments,
<br>And with the multitude of thy sorceries,
<br>Wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth;
<br>If so be thou shalt be able to profit, If so be thou mayest prevail.
<br>13Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels;
<br>Let now the astrologers, the stargazers,
<br>The monthly prognosticators, Stand up, and save thee
<br> 
<br>From the things that shall come upon thee.
<br>14Behold, they shall be as stubble; The fire shall burn them;
<br>They shall not deliver themselves From the power of the flame;
<br>It shall not be a coal to warm at, Nor a fire to sit before.
<br>15Thus shall they be unto thee With whom thou hast laboured;
<br>They that have trafficked with thee from thy youth
<br>Shall wander every one to his quarter;
<br>There shall be none to save thee.
<br>
<br>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob,
<br>Who are called by the name of Israel,
<br>And are come forth out of the fountain of Judah;
<br>Who swear by the name of the LORD,
<br>And make mention of the God of Israel,
<br>But not in truth, nor in righteousness.
<br>2For they call themselves of the holy city,
<br>And stay themselves upon the God of Israel,
<br>The LORD of hosts is His name.
<br>3I have declared the former things from of old;
<br>Yea, they went forth out of My mouth, and I announced them;
<br>Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
<br> 
<br>4Because I knew that thou art obstinate,
<br>And thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
<br>5Therefore I have declared it to thee from of old;
<br>Before it came to pass I announced it to thee;
<br>Lest thou shouldest say: ‘Mine idol hath done them,
<br>And my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.’
<br>6Thou hast heard, see, all this; And ye, will ye not declare it?
<br>I have announced unto thee new things from this time,
<br>Even hidden things, which thou hast not known.
<br>7They are created now, and not from of old,
<br>And before this day thou heardest them not;
<br>Lest thou shouldest say: ‘Behold, I knew them.’
<br>8Yea, thou heardest not; Yea, thou knewest not;
<br>Yea, from of old thine ear was not opened;
<br>For I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously,
<br>And wast called a transgressor from the womb.
<br>9For My name’s sake will I defer Mine anger,
<br>And for My praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
<br>10Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver;
<br> 
<br>I have tried thee in the furnace of affliction.
<br>11For Mine own sake, for Mine own sake, will I do it;
<br>For how should it be profaned?
<br>And My glory will I not give to another.
<br>
<br>12Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, And Israel My called:
<br>I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.
<br>13Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth,
<br>And My right hand hath spread out the heavens;
<br>When I call unto them, They stand up together.
<br>14Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear;
<br>Which among them hath declared these things?
<br>He whom the LORD loveth shall perform His pleasure on Babylon,
<br>And show His arm on the Chaldeans.
<br>15I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him;
<br>I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
<br>
<br>16Come ye near unto Me, hear ye this:
<br>From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;
<br>From the time that it was, there am I;
<br>And now the Lord GOD hath sent me, and His spirit.
<br> 
<br>
<br>17Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer,
<br>The Holy One of Israel:
<br>I am the LORD thy God,
<br>Who teacheth thee for thy profit,
<br>Who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.
<br>18Oh that thou wouldest hearken to My commandments!
<br>Then would thy peace be as a river,
<br>And thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;
<br>19Thy seed also would be as the sand,
<br>And the offspring of thy body like the grains thereof;
<br>His name would not be cut off Nor destroyed from before Me.
<br>
<br>20Go ye forth from Babylon, Flee ye from the Chaldeans; With a voice of singing Declare ye, tell this,
<br>Utter it even to the end of the earth; Say ye: ‘The LORD hath redeemed
<br>His servant Jacob.
<br>21And they thirsted not
<br>When He led them through the deserts;
<br>He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them;
<br>He cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out.’
<br>22There is no peace,
<br>Saith the LORD concerning the wicked.
<br> 
<br>Listen, O isles, unto me,
<br>And hearken, ye peoples, from far:
<br>The LORD hath called me from the womb,
<br>From the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of my name; 2And He hath made my mouth like a
<br>sharp sword,
<br>In the shadow of His hand hath He hid me;
<br>And He hath made me a polished shaft,
<br>In His quiver hath He concealed me;
<br>3And He said unto me: ‘Thou art My servant,
<br>Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’
<br>4But I said: ‘I have laboured in vain,
<br>I have spent my strength for nought and vanity;
<br>Yet surely my right is with the LORD,
<br>And my recompense with my God.’
<br>5And now saith the LORD
<br>That formed me from the womb to be His servant,
<br>To bring Jacob back to Him, And that Israel be gathered unto
<br>Him—
<br>For I am honourable in the eyes of the LORD,
<br>And my God is become my strength—
<br>6Yea, He saith: ‘It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be My servant
<br>To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the offspring of
<br>Israel;
<br> 
<br>I will also give thee for a light of the nations,
<br>That My salvation may be unto the end of the earth.’
<br>
<br>7Thus saith the LORD,
<br>The Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One,
<br>To him who is despised of men, To him who is abhorred of nations, To a servant of rulers:
<br>Kings shall see and arise,
<br>Princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;
<br>Because of the LORD that is faithful,
<br>Even the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.
<br>
<br>8Thus saith the LORD:
<br>In an acceptable time have I answered thee,
<br>And in a day of salvation have I helped thee;
<br>And I will preserve thee, and give thee
<br>For a covenant of the people, To raise up the land,
<br>To cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
<br>9Saying to the prisoners: ‘Go forth’;
<br>To them that are in darkness: ‘Show yourselves’;
<br>They shall feed in the ways,
<br>And in all high hills shall be their pasture;
<br>10They shall not hunger nor thirst,
<br>Neither shall the heat nor sun smite them;
<br> 
<br>For He that hath compassion on them will lead them,
<br>Even by the springs of water will He guide them.
<br>11And I will make all My mountains a way,
<br>And My highways shall be raised on high.
<br>12Behold, these shall come from far;
<br>And, lo, these from the north and from the west,
<br>And these from the land of Sinim.
<br>
<br>13Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth,
<br>And break forth into singing, O mountains;
<br>For the LORD hath comforted His people,
<br>And hath compassion upon His afflicted.
<br>
<br>14But Zion said: ‘The LORD hath forsaken me,
<br>And the Lord hath forgotten me.’
<br>15Can a woman forget her sucking child,
<br>That she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
<br>Yea, these may forget, Yet will not I forget thee.
<br>16Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands;
<br>Thy walls are continually before Me.
<br>17Thy children make haste;
<br> 
<br>Thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee.
<br>18Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold:
<br>All these gather themselves together, and come to thee.
<br>As I live, saith the LORD,
<br>Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament,
<br>And gird thyself with them, like a bride.
<br>19For thy waste and thy desolate places
<br>And thy land that hath been destroyed—
<br>Surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants,
<br>And they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
<br>20The children of thy bereavement Shall yet say in thine ears:
<br>‘The place is too strait for me; Give place to me that I may dwell.’ 21Then shalt thou say in thy heart: ‘Who hath begotten me these,
<br>Seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary,
<br>An exile, and wandering to and fro? And who hath brought up these?
<br>Behold, I was left alone; These, where were they?’
<br>
<br>22Thus saith the Lord GOD:
<br>Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations,
<br>And set up Mine ensign to the peoples,
<br> 
<br>And they shall bring thy sons in their bosom,
<br>And thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
<br>23And kings shall be thy foster- fathers,
<br>And their queens thy nursing mothers;
<br>They shall bow down to thee with their face to the earth,
<br>And lick the dust of thy feet;
<br>And thou shalt know that I am the LORD,
<br>For they shall not be ashamed that wait for Me.
<br>
<br>24Shall the prey be taken from the mighty,
<br>Or the captives of the victorious be delivered?
<br>25But thus saith the LORD:
<br>Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
<br>And the prey of the terrible shall be delivered;
<br>And I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,
<br>And I will save thy children.
<br>26And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
<br>And they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine;
<br>And all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour,
<br>And thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD: Where is the bill of your
<br> 
<br>mother’s divorcement, Wherewith I have put her away? Or which of My creditors is it To whom I have sold you?
<br>Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold,
<br>And for your transgressions was your mother put away.
<br>2Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?
<br>When I called, was there none to answer?
<br>Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?
<br>Or have I no power to deliver?
<br>Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea,
<br>I make the rivers a wilderness;
<br>Their fish become foul, because there is no water,
<br>And die for thirst.
<br>3I clothe the heavens with blackness,
<br>And I make sackcloth their covering.
<br>
<br>4The Lord GOD hath given me
<br>The tongue of them that are taught, That I should know how to sustain with words him that is weary;
<br>He wakeneth morning by morning, He wakeneth mine ear
<br>To hear as they that are taught.
<br>5The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear,
<br>And I was not rebellious, Neither turned away backward. 6I gave my back to the smiters,
<br>And my checks to them that plucked off the hair;
<br> 
<br>I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
<br>7For the Lord GOD will help me;
<br>Therefore have I not been confounded;
<br>Therefore have I set my face like a flint,
<br>And I know that I shall not be ashamed.
<br>8He is near that justifieth me;
<br>Who will contend with me? let us stand up together;
<br>Who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.
<br>9Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; Who is he that shall condemn me?
<br>Behold, they all shall wax old as a garment,
<br>The moth shall eat them up.
<br>
<br>10Who is among you that feareth the LORD,
<br>That obeyeth the voice of His servant?
<br>Though he walketh in darkness, And hath no light,
<br>Let him trust in the name of the LORD,
<br>And stay upon his God.
<br>11Behold, all ye that kindle a fire,
<br>That gird yourselves with firebrands,
<br>Begone in the flame of your fire,
<br>And among the brands that ye have kindled.
<br>This shall ye have of My hand; Ye shall lie down in sorrow.
<br> 
<br>Hearken to Me, ye that follow after righteousness,
<br>Ye that seek the LORD;
<br>Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn,
<br>And to the hole of the pit whence ye were digged.
<br>2Look unto Abraham your father, And unto Sarah that bore you;
<br>For when he was but one I called him,
<br>And I blessed him, and made him many.
<br>3For the LORD hath comforted Zion;
<br>He hath comforted all her waste places,
<br>And hath made her wilderness like Eden,
<br>And her desert like the garden of the LORD;
<br>Joy and gladness shall be found therein,
<br>Thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
<br>
<br>4Attend unto Me, O My people,
<br>And give ear unto Me, O My nation; For instruction shall go forth from
<br>Me,
<br>And My right on a sudden for a light of the peoples.
<br>5My favour is near,
<br>My salvation is gone forth,
<br>And Mine arms shall judge the peoples;
<br>The isles shall wait for Me,
<br>And on Mine arm shall they trust. 6Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look upon the earth beneath;
<br> 
<br>For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,
<br>And the earth shall wax old like a garment,
<br>And they that dwell therein shall die in like manner;
<br>But My salvation shall be for ever,
<br>And My favour shall not be abolished.
<br>
<br>7Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness,
<br>The people in whose heart is My law;
<br>Fear ye not the taunt of men,
<br>Neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.
<br>8For the moth shall eat them up like a garment,
<br>And the worm shall eat them like wool;
<br>But My favour shall be for ever,
<br>And My salvation unto all generations.
<br>
<br>9Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD;
<br>Awake, as in the days of old, The generations of ancient times.
<br>Art thou not it that hewed Rahab in pieces,
<br>That pierced the dragon?
<br>10Art thou not it that dried up the sea,
<br>The waters of the great deep;
<br>That made the depths of the sea a way
<br>For the redeemed to pass over?
<br> 
<br>11And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,
<br>And come with singing unto Zion,
<br>And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;
<br>They shall obtain gladness and joy,
<br>And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
<br>
<br>12I, even I, am He that comforteth you:
<br>Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die,
<br>And of the son of man that shall be made as grass;
<br>13And hast forgotten the LORD thy Maker,
<br>That stretched forth the heavens,
<br>And laid the foundations of the earth;
<br>And fearest continually all the day Because of the fury of the
<br>oppressor,
<br>As he maketh ready to destroy?
<br>And where is the fury of the oppressor?
<br>14He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed;
<br>And he shall not go down dying into the pit,
<br>Neither shall his bread fail.
<br>15For I am the LORD thy God,
<br>Who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar;
<br>The LORD of hosts is His name.
<br>16And I have put My words in thy mouth,
<br>And have covered thee in the shadow of My hand,
<br> 
<br>That I may plant the heavens,
<br>And lay the foundations of the earth,
<br>And say unto Zion: ‘Thou art My people.’
<br>
<br>17Awake, awake, Stand up, O Jerusalem,
<br>That hast drunk at the hand of the LORD
<br>The cup of His fury;
<br>Thou hast drunken the beaker, even the cup of staggering,
<br>And drained it.
<br>18There is none to guide her Among all the sons whom she hath
<br>brought forth;
<br>Neither is there any that taketh her by the hand
<br>Of all the sons that she hath brought up.
<br>19These two things are befallen thee; Who shall bemoan thee?
<br>Desolation and destruction, And the famine and the sword; How shall I comfort thee?
<br>20Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets,
<br>As an antelope in a net;
<br>They are full of the fury of the LORD, The rebuke of thy God.
<br>21Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted,
<br>And drunken, but not with wine;
<br>22Thus saith thy Lord the LORD,
<br>And thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people:
<br>Behold, I have taken out of thy hand The cup of staggering;
<br> 
<br>The beaker, even the cup of My fury,
<br>Thou shalt no more drink it again;
<br>23And I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
<br>That have said to thy soul:
<br>‘Bow down, that we may go over’;
<br>And thou hast laid thy back as the ground,
<br>And as the street, to them that go over.
<br>
<br>Awake, awake,
<br>Put on thy strength, O Zion; Put on thy beautiful garments,
<br>O Jerusalem, the holy city;
<br>For henceforth there shall no more come into thee
<br>The uncircumcised and the unclean.
<br>2Shake thyself from the dust; Arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem;
<br>Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck,
<br>O captive daughter of Zion.
<br>
<br>3For thus saith the LORD:
<br>Ye were sold for nought;
<br>And ye shall be redeemed without money.
<br>4For thus saith the Lord GOD:
<br>My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there;
<br>And the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
<br>5Now therefore, what do I here, saith the LORD,
<br>Seeing that My people is taken away for nought?
<br> 
<br>They that rule over them do howl, saith the LORD,
<br>And My name continually all the day is blasphemed.
<br>6Therefore My people shall know My name;
<br>Therefore they shall know in that day
<br>That I, even He that spoke, behold, here I am.
<br>
<br>7How beautiful upon the mountains Are the feet of the messenger of
<br>good tidings,
<br>That announceth peace, the harbinger of good tidings,
<br>That announceth salvation; That saith unto Zion:
<br>‘Thy God reigneth! ’
<br>8Hark, thy watchmen! they lift up the voice,
<br>Together do they sing;
<br>For they shall see, eye to eye, The LORD returning to Zion.
<br>9Break forth into joy, sing together, Ye waste places of Jerusalem;
<br>For the LORD hath comforted His people,
<br>He hath redeemed Jerusalem.
<br>10The LORD hath made bare His holy arm
<br>In the eyes of all the nations;
<br>And all the ends of the earth shall see
<br>The salvation of our God.
<br>11Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence,
<br>Touch no unclean thing;
<br> 
<br>Go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean,
<br>Ye that bear the vessels of the LORD. 12For ye shall not go out in haste, Neither shall ye go by flight;
<br>For the LORD will go before you,
<br>And the God of Israel will be your rearward.
<br>
<br>13Behold, My servant shall prosper, He shall be exalted and lifted up,
<br>and shall be very high.
<br>14According as many were appalled at thee—
<br>So marred was his visage unlike that of a man,
<br>And his form unlike that of the sons of men—
<br>15So shall he startle many nations,
<br>Kings shall shut their mouths because of him;
<br>For that which had not been told them shall they see,
<br>And that which they had not heard shall they perceive.
<br>’Who would have believed our report?
<br>And to whom hath the arm of the LORD been revealed?
<br>2For he shot up right forth as a sapling,
<br>And as a root out of a dry ground;
<br>He had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him,
<br>Nor beauty that we should delight in him.
<br>3He was despised, and forsaken of men,
<br> 
<br>A man of pains, and acquainted with disease,
<br>And as one from whom men hide their face:
<br>He was despised, and we esteemed him not.
<br>4Surely our diseases he did bear, and our pains he carried;
<br>Whereas we did esteem him stricken,
<br>Smitten of God, and afflicted.
<br>5But he was wounded because of our transgressions,
<br>He was crushed because of our iniquities:
<br>The chastisement of our welfare was upon him,
<br>And with his stripes we were healed.
<br>6All we like sheep did go astray,
<br>We turned every one to his own way;
<br>And the LORD hath made to light on him
<br>The iniquity of us all.
<br>7He was oppressed, though he humbled himself
<br>And opened not his mouth;
<br>As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
<br>And as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb;
<br>Yea, he opened not his mouth.
<br>8By oppression and judgment he was taken away,
<br>And with his generation who did reason?
<br>For he was cut off out of the land of the living,
<br> 
<br>For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due.
<br>9And they made his grave with the wicked,
<br>And with the rich his tomb; Although he had done no violence,
<br>Neither was any deceit in his mouth.’
<br>
<br>10Yet it pleased the LORD to crush him by disease;
<br>To see if his soul would offer itself in restitution,
<br>That he might see his seed, prolong his days,
<br>And that the purpose of the LORD might prosper by his hand:
<br>11Of the travail of his soul he shall see to the full, even My servant, Who by his knowledge did justify the Righteous One to the many,
<br>And their iniquities he did bear.
<br>12Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great,
<br>And he shall divide the spoil with the mighty;
<br>Because he bared his soul unto death,
<br>And was numbered with the transgressors;
<br>Yet he bore the sin of many,
<br>And made intercession for the transgressors.
<br>
<br>Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear,
<br>Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail;
<br> 
<br>For more are the children of the desolate
<br>Than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.
<br>2Enlarge the place of thy tent,
<br>And let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations, spare not;
<br>Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.
<br>3For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left;
<br>And thy seed shall possess the nations,
<br>And make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
<br>4Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed.
<br>Neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame;
<br>For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth,
<br>And the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.
<br>5For thy Maker is thy husband, The LORD of hosts is His name; And the Holy One of Israel is thy
<br>Redeemer,
<br>The God of the whole earth shall He be called.
<br>6For the LORD hath called thee
<br>As a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit;
<br>And a wife of youth, can she be rejected?
<br>Saith thy God.
<br>7For a small moment have I forsaken thee;
<br> 
<br>But with great compassion will I gather thee.
<br>8In a little wrath I hid My face from thee for a moment;
<br>But with everlasting kindness will I have compassion on thee,
<br>Saith the LORD thy Redeemer.
<br>9For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me;
<br>For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah
<br>Should no more go over the earth,
<br>So have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee,
<br>Nor rebuke thee.
<br>10For the mountains may depart, And the hills be removed;
<br>But My kindness shall not depart from thee,
<br>Neither shall My covenant of peace be removed,
<br>Saith the LORD that hath compass- sion on thee.
<br>
<br>11O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest,
<br>And not comforted,
<br>Behold, I will set thy stones in fair colours,
<br>And lay thy foundations with sapphires.
<br>12And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies,
<br>And thy gates of carbuncles,
<br>And all thy border of precious stones.
<br>13And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD;
<br> 
<br>And great shall be the peace of thy children.
<br>14In righteousness shalt thou be established;
<br>Be thou far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear,
<br>And from ruin, for it shall not come near thee.
<br>15Behold, they may gather together, but not by Me;
<br>Whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.
<br>16Behold, I have created the smith That bloweth the fire of coals,
<br>And bringeth forth a weapon for his work;
<br>And I have created the waster to destroy.
<br>17No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper;
<br>And every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
<br>This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD,
<br>And their due reward from Me, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye for water,
<br>And he that hath no money; Come ye, buy, and eat;
<br>Yea, come, buy wine and milk Without money and without price. 2Wherefore do ye spend money for
<br>that which is not bread?
<br>And your gain for that which satisfieth not?
<br> 
<br>Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good,
<br>And let your soul delight itself in fatness.
<br>3Incline your ear, and come unto Me;
<br>Hear, and your soul shall live;
<br>And I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
<br>Even the sure mercies of David.
<br>4Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
<br>A prince and commander to the peoples.
<br>5Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not,
<br>And a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee;
<br>Because of the LORD thy God,
<br>And for the Holy One of Israel, for He hath glorified thee.
<br>
<br>6Seek ye the LORD while He may be found,
<br>Call ye upon Him while He is near;
<br>7Let the wicked forsake his way,
<br>And the man of iniquity his thoughts;
<br>And let him return unto the LORD, and He will have compassion upon him,
<br>And to our God, for He will abundantly pardon
<br>8For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
<br>Neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD.
<br>9For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
<br> 
<br>So are My ways higher than your ways,
<br>And My thoughts than your thoughts.
<br>10For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven,
<br>And returneth not thither, Except it water the earth,
<br>And make it bring forth and bud,
<br>And give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
<br>11So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth:
<br>It shall not return unto Me void,
<br>Except it accomplish that which I please,
<br>And make the thing whereto I sent it prosper.
<br>12For ye shall go out with joy, And be led forth with peace;
<br>The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing,
<br>And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
<br>13Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress,
<br>And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;
<br>And it shall be to the LORD for a memorial,
<br>For an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Keep ye justice, and do righteousness;
<br>For My salvation is near to come, And My favour to be revealed.
<br> 
<br>2Happy is the man that doeth this,
<br>And the son of man that holdeth fast by it:
<br>That keepeth the sabbath from profaning it,
<br>And keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
<br>3Neither let the alien,
<br>That hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying:
<br>‘The LORD will surely separate me from His people’;
<br>Neither let the eunuch say: ‘Behold, I am a dry tree.’ 4For thus saith the LORD
<br>Concerning the eunuchs that keep My sabbaths,
<br>And choose the things that please Me,
<br>And hold fast by My covenant:
<br>5Even unto them will I give in My house
<br>And within My walls a monument and a memorial
<br>Better than sons and daughters;
<br>I will give them an everlasting memorial,
<br>That shall not be cut off.
<br>6Also the aliens, that join themselves to the LORD, to minister unto Him,
<br>And to love the name of the LORD, To be His servants,
<br>Every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it,
<br>And holdeth fast by My covenant:
<br>7Even them will I bring to My holy mountain,
<br> 
<br>And make them joyful in My house of prayer;
<br>Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices
<br>Shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; For My house shall be called
<br>A house of prayer for all peoples.
<br>8Saith the Lord GOD who gathereth the dispersed of Israel:
<br>Yet I will gather others to him, beside those of him that are gathered.
<br>
<br>9All ye beasts of the field, come to devour,
<br>Yea, all ye beasts in the forest. 10His watchmen are all blind, Without knowledge;
<br>They are all dumb dogs, They cannot bark;
<br>Raving, lying down, loving to slumber.
<br>11Yea, the dogs are greedy,
<br>They know not when they have enough;
<br>And these are shepherds That cannot understand;
<br>They all turn to their own way, Each one to his gain, one and all. 12’Come ye, I will fetch wine,
<br>And we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
<br>And to-morrow shall be as this day, And much more abundant.’
<br>
<br>The righteous perisheth,
<br>And no man layeth it to heart, And godly men are taken away, None considering
<br> 
<br>That the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
<br>2He entereth into peace, They rest in their beds,
<br>Each one that walketh in his uprightness.
<br>
<br>3But draw near hither, Ye sons of the sorceress,
<br>The seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
<br>4Against whom do ye sport yourselves?
<br>Against whom make ye a wide mouth,
<br>And draw out the tongue?
<br>Are ye not children of transgression, A seed of falsehood,
<br>5Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths,
<br>Under every leafy tree;
<br>That slay the children in the valleys, Under the clefts of the rocks?
<br>6Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion;
<br>They, they are thy lot;
<br>Even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering,
<br>Thou hast offered a meal-offering.
<br>Should I pacify Myself for these things?
<br>7Upon a high and lofty mountain Hast thou set thy bed;
<br>Thither also wentest thou up To offer sacrifice.
<br>8And behind the doors and the posts Hast thou set up thy symbol;
<br>For thou hast uncovered, and art gone up from Me,
<br> 
<br>Thou hast enlarged thy bed, And chosen thee of them Whose bed thou lovedst, Whose hand thou sawest.
<br>9And thou wentest to the king with ointment,
<br>And didst increase thy perfumes,
<br>And didst send thine ambassadors far off,
<br>Even down to the nether-world.
<br>10Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not: ‘There is no hope’; thou didst find a renewal of thy strength, therefore thou wast not affected.
<br>11And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou wouldest fail? And as for Me, thou hast not remembered Me, nor laid it to thy heart. Have not I held My peace even of long time? Therefore thou fearest Me not.
<br>12I will declare thy righteousness; thy works also—they shall not profit thee.
<br>13When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away, a breath shall bear them off; but he that taketh refuge in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.
<br>
<br>14And He will say:
<br>Cast ye up, cast ye up, clear the way,
<br>Take up the stumblingblock out of the way of My people.
<br> 
<br>15For thus saith the High and Lofty One
<br>That inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy:
<br>I dwell in the high and holy place,
<br>With him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
<br>To revive the spirit of the humble,
<br>And to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
<br>16For I will not contend for ever, Neither will I be always wroth;
<br>For the spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me,
<br>And the souls which I have made.
<br>17For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him,
<br>I hid Me and was wroth;
<br>And he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
<br>18I have seen his ways, and will heal him;
<br>I will lead him also, and requite with comforts him and his mourners.
<br>19Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near,
<br>Saith the LORD that createth the fruit of the lips;
<br>And I will heal him.
<br>20But the wicked are like the troubled sea;
<br>For it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
<br>21There is no peace,
<br>Saith my God concerning the wicked.
<br> 
<br>Cry aloud, spare not,
<br>Lift up thy voice like a horn,
<br>And declare unto My people their transgression,
<br>And to the house of Jacob their sins.
<br>2Yet they seek Me daily,
<br>And delight to know My ways; As a nation that did righteousness,
<br>And forsook not the ordinance of their God,
<br>They ask of Me righteous ordinances,
<br>They delight to draw near unto God.
<br>
<br>3’Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not?
<br>Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge?’—
<br>Behold, in the day of your fast ye pursue your business,
<br>And exact all your labours.
<br>4Behold, ye fast for strife and contention,
<br>And to smite with the fist of wickedness;
<br>Ye fast not this day
<br>So as to make your voice to be heard on high.
<br>5Is such the fast that I have chosen?
<br>The day for a man to afflict his soul?
<br>Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush,
<br>And to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?
<br>Wilt thou call this a fast,
<br>And an acceptable day to the LORD?
<br> 
<br>6Is not this the fast that I have chosen?
<br>To loose the fetters of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free, And that ye break every yoke?
<br>7Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry,
<br>And that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?
<br>When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him,
<br>And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
<br>8Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
<br>And thy healing shall spring forth speedily;
<br>And thy righteousness shall go before thee,
<br>The glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.
<br>9Then shalt thou call, and the LORD will answer;
<br>Thou shalt cry, and He will say: ‘Here I am.’
<br>If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke,
<br>The putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedness;
<br>10And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,
<br>And satisfy the afflicted soul;
<br>Then shall thy light rise in darkness, And thy gloom be as the noon-day; 11And the LORD will guide thee
<br>continually,
<br>And satisfy thy soul in drought, And make strong thy bones;
<br> 
<br>And thou shalt be like a watered garden,
<br>And like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
<br>12And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places,
<br>The restorer of paths to dwell in.
<br>13If thou turn away thy foot because of the sabbath,
<br>From pursuing thy business on My holy day;
<br>And call the sabbath a delight,
<br>And the holy of the LORD honourable;
<br>And shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways,
<br>Nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof;
<br>14Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD,
<br>And I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,
<br>And I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father;
<br>For the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
<br>
<br>Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,
<br>Neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear;
<br>2But your iniquities have separated Between you and your God,
<br>And your sins have hid His face from you,
<br>That He will not hear.
<br>3For your hands are defiled with blood,
<br> 
<br>Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;
<br>And thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach,
<br>
<br>
<br>And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken lies,
<br>Your tongue muttereth wickedness.
<br>4None sueth in righteousness, And none pleadeth in truth;
<br>They trust in vanity, and speak lies,
<br>They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
<br>5They hatch basilisks’eggs, And weave the spider’s web;
<br>He that eateth of their eggs dieth,
<br>And that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
<br>6Their webs shall not become garments,
<br>Neither shall men cover themselves with their works;
<br>Their works are works of iniquity,
<br>And the act of violence is in their hands.
<br>7Their feet run to evil,
<br>And they make haste to shed innocent blood;
<br>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity,
<br>Desolation and destruction are in their paths.
<br>8The way of peace they know not, And there is no right in their goings;
<br>They have made them crooked paths,
<br>Whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.
<br> 
<br>
<br>9Therefore is justice far from us,
<br>Neither doth righteousness overtake us;
<br>We look for light, but behold darkness,
<br>For brightness, but we walk in gloom.
<br>10We grope for the wall like the blind,
<br>Yea, as they that have no eyes do we grope;
<br>We stumble at noonday as in the twilight;
<br>We are in dark places like the dead.
<br>11We all growl like bears, And mourn sore like doves;
<br>We look for right, but there is none;
<br>For salvation, but it is far off from us.
<br>
<br>12For our transgressions are multiplied before Thee,
<br>And our sins testify against us;
<br>For our transgressions are present to us,
<br>And as for our iniquities, we know them:
<br>13Transgressing and denying the LORD,
<br>And turning away from following our God,
<br>Speaking oppression and perverseness,
<br>Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
<br>14And justice is turned away backward,
<br>And righteousness standeth afar off;
<br> 
<br>For truth hath stumbled in the broad place,
<br>And uprightness cannot enter.
<br>15And truth is lacking,
<br>And he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.
<br>
<br>And the LORD saw it, and it displeased Him
<br>That there was no justice;
<br>16And He saw that there was no man,
<br>And was astonished that there was no intercessor;
<br>Therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him;
<br>And His righteousness, it sustained Him;
<br>17And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail,
<br>And a helmet of salvation upon His head,
<br>And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
<br>And was clad with zeal as a cloak.
<br>18According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay,
<br>Fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies;
<br>To the islands He will repay recompense.
<br>19So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west,
<br>And His glory from the rising of the sun;
<br>For distress will come in like a flood,
<br>Which the breath of the LORD driveth.
<br> 
<br>
<br>20And a redeemer will come to Zion,
<br>And unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>21And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and My words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
<br>
<br>Arise, shine, for thy light is come,
<br>And the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
<br>2For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
<br>And gross darkness the peoples; But upon thee the LORD will arise,
<br>And His glory shall be seen upon thee.
<br>3And nations shall walk at thy light,
<br>And kings at the brightness of thy rising.
<br>
<br>4Lift Up thine eyes round about, and see:
<br>They all are gathered together, and come to thee;
<br>Thy sons come from far,
<br>And thy daughters are borne on the side.
<br>5Then thou shalt see and be radiant,
<br>And thy heart shall throb and be enlarged;
<br> 
<br>Because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee,
<br>The wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.
<br>6The caravan of camels shall cover thee,
<br>And of the young camels of Midian and Ephah,
<br>All coming from Sheba;
<br>They shall bring gold and incense, And shall proclaim the praises of the
<br>LORD.
<br>7All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
<br>The rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee;
<br>They shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar,
<br>And I will glorify My glorious house.
<br>
<br>8Who are these that fly as a cloud, And as the doves to their cotes?
<br>9Surely the isles shall wait for Me, And the ships of Tarshish first,
<br>To bring thy sons from far,
<br>Their silver and their gold with them,
<br>For the name of the LORD thy God, And for the Holy One of Israel,
<br>because He hath glorified thee.
<br>
<br>10And aliens shall build up thy walls,
<br>And their kings shall minister unto thee;
<br>For in My wrath I smote thee,
<br>But in My favour have I had compassion on thee.
<br> 
<br>11Thy gates also shall be open continually,
<br>Day and night, they shall not be shut;
<br>That men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations,
<br>And their kings in procession.
<br>12For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish;
<br>Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
<br>
<br>13The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee,
<br>The cypress, the plane-tree and the larch together;
<br>To beautify the place of My sanctuary,
<br>And I will make the place of My feet glorious.
<br>14And the sons of them that afflicted thee
<br>Shall come bending unto thee,
<br>And all they that despised thee shall bow down
<br>At the soles of thy feet;
<br>And they shall call thee The city of the LORD,
<br>The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<br>15Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated,
<br>So that no man passed through thee,
<br>I will make thee an eternal excellency,
<br>A joy of many generations.
<br>16Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations,
<br>And shalt suck the breast of kings;
<br> 
<br>And thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour,
<br>And I, the Mighty One of Jacob, thy Redeemer.
<br>
<br>17For brass I will bring gold, And for iron I will bring silver, And for wood brass,
<br>And for stones iron;
<br>I will also make thy officers peace, And righteousness thy magistrates. 18Violence shall no more be heard in
<br>thy land,
<br>Desolation nor destruction within thy borders;
<br>But thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,
<br>And thy gates Praise.
<br>
<br>19The sun shall be no more thy light by day,
<br>Neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee;
<br>But the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light,
<br>And thy God thy glory.
<br>20Thy sun shall no more go down,
<br>Neither shall thy moon withdraw itself;
<br>For the LORD shall be thine everlasting light,
<br>And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
<br>
<br>21Thy people also shall be all righteous,
<br>They shall inherit the land for ever;
<br>The branch of My planting, the work of My hands,
<br> 
<br>Wherein I glory.
<br>22The smallest shall become a thousand,
<br>And the least a mighty nation;
<br>I the LORD will hasten it in its time.
<br>
<br>The spirit of the Lord God	is upon me;
<br>Because the LORD hath anointed me To bring good tidings unto the
<br>humble;
<br>He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,
<br>To proclaim liberty to the captives,
<br>And the opening of the eyes to them that are bound;
<br>2To proclaim the year of the LORD’S good pleasure,
<br>And the day of vengeance of our God;
<br>To comfort all that mourn;
<br>3To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
<br>To give unto them a garland for ashes,
<br>The oil of joy for mourning,
<br>The mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
<br>That they might be called terebinths of righteousness,
<br>The planting of the LORD, wherein He might glory.
<br>4And they shall build the old wastes,
<br>They shall raise up the former desolations,
<br>And they shall renew the waste cities,
<br>The desolations of many generations.
<br> 
<br>5And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,
<br>And aliens shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
<br>6But ye shall be named the priests of the LORD,
<br>Men shall call you the ministers of our God;
<br>Ye shall eat the wealth of the nations,
<br>And in their splendour shall ye revel.
<br>7For your shame which was double, And for that they rejoiced:
<br>‘Confusion is their portion’;
<br>Therefore in their land they shall possess double,
<br>Everlasting joy shall be unto them.
<br>
<br>8For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity;
<br>And I will give them their recompense in truth,
<br>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
<br>9And their seed shall be known among the nations,
<br>And their offspring among the peoples;
<br>All that see them shall acknowledge them,
<br>That they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.
<br>
<br>10I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, My soul shall be joyful in my God;
<br>For He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
<br> 
<br>He hath covered me with the robe of victory,
<br>As a bridegroom putteth on a priestly diadem,
<br>And as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
<br>11For as the earth bringeth forth her growth,
<br>And as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth;
<br>So the Lord GOD will cause victory and glory
<br>To spring forth before all the nations.
<br>
<br>For Zion’s sake will I not hold My peace,
<br>And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
<br>Until her triumph go forth as brightness,
<br>And her salvation as a torch that burneth.
<br>2And the nations shall see thy triumph,
<br>And all kings thy glory;
<br>And thou shalt be called by a new name,
<br>Which the mouth of the LORD shall mark out.
<br>3Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD,
<br>And a royal diadem in the open hand of thy God.
<br>4Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken,
<br>Neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate;
<br> 
<br>But thou shalt be called, My delight is in her,
<br>And thy land, Espoused;
<br>For the LORD delighteth in thee, And thy land shall be espoused. 5For as a young man espouseth a
<br>virgin,
<br>So shall thy sons espouse thee;
<br>And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
<br>So shall thy God rejoice over thee.
<br>
<br>6I have set watchmen
<br>Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, They shall never hold their peace Day nor night:
<br>‘Ye that are the LORD’S remembrancers,
<br>Take ye no rest,
<br>7And give Him no rest, Till He establish,
<br>And till He make Jerusalem A praise in the earth.’
