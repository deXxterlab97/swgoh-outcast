<br>
<br>(A) Basis for request.—Under procedures the Administrator establishes, a person may request the Administrator to review a regulation relating to procurement on the basis that the regulation is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
<br>
<br>(B) Period of review.—Unless the request is frivolous or does not, on its face, state a valid basis for the review, the Administrator shall complete the review not later than 60 days after receiving the request. The time for completion of the review may be extended if the Administrator determines that an additional period of review is required. The Administrator shall advise the requester of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the review will be completed.
<br>
<br>(5) When regulation is inconsistent or needs to be improved.—If the Administrator determines that a regulation relating to procurement is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation or that the regulation otherwise should be revised to remove an inconsistency with the policies prescribed under section 1121(b) of this title, the Administrator shall rescind or deny the promulgation of the regulation or take other action authorized under sections 1121, 1122(a) to (c)(1), 1125, 1126, 1130, 1131, and 2305 of this title as may be necessary to remove the inconsistency. If the Administrator determines that the regulation, although not inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation or those policies, should be revised to improve compliance with the Regulation or policies, the Administrator shall take action authorized under sections 1121, 1122(a) to (c)(1), 1125, 1126, 1130, 1131, and 2305 as may be necessary and appropriate.
<br>
<br>(6) Decisions to be in writing and publicly available.—The decisions of the Administrator shall be in writing and made publicly available.
<br>
<br>(b) Additional Responsibilities of Membership.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the head of the agency concerned, each official who represents an agency on the Council pursuant to section 1302(b) of this title shall—
<br>
<br>(A) approve or disapprove all regulations relating to procurement that are proposed for public comment, prescribed in final form, or otherwise made effective by that agency before the regulation may be prescribed in final form, or otherwise made effective, except that the official may grant an interim approval, without review, for not more than 60 days for a procurement regulation in urgent and compelling circumstances;
<br>
<br>(B) carry out the responsibilities of that agency set forth in chapter 35 of title 44 for each information collection request that relates to procurement rules or regulations; and
<br>
<br>(C) eliminate or reduce—
<br>
<br>(i) any redundant or unnecessary levels of review and approval in the procurement system of that agency; and

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1)(B), the words "(as that term is defined in section 3502(11) of title 44)" are omitted because chapter 35 of title 44 was amended generally by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–13, 109 Stat. 163) and 44:3502 no longer defines "information collection request". The term "information collection request" is retained in this section of the revised title, however, because 44:ch. 35 still contains provisions about requests for collection of information.

<br>Addressing Tax Delinquency by Government Contractors
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 20, 2010, 75 F.R. 3979, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>The Federal Government pays more than half a trillion dollars a year to contractors and has an important obligation to protect American taxpayer money and the integrity of the Federal acquisition process. Yet reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) state that Federal contracts are awarded to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax delinquencies. The total amount in unpaid taxes owed by these contracting companies is estimated to be more than $5 billion.
<br>
<br>Too often, Federal contracting officials do not have the most basic information they need to make informed judgments about whether a company trying to win a Federal contract is delinquent in paying its taxes. We need to give our contracting officials the tools they need to protect taxpayer dollars.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, I hereby direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) to direct a review of certifications of non-delinquency in taxes that companies bidding for Federal contracts are required to submit pursuant to a 2008 amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. I further direct that the Commissioner report to me within 90 days on the overall accuracy of contractors' certifications.
<br>
<br>I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, working with the Secretary of the Treasury and other agency heads, to evaluate practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to contractors' certifications of serious tax delinquencies and to provide me, within 90 days, recommendations on process improvements to ensure these contractors are not awarded new contracts, including a plan to make contractor certifications available in a Government-wide database, as is already being done with other information on contractors.
<br>
<br>Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
