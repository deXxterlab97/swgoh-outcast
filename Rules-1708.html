<br>Proc. No. 8442. National Forest Products Week
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 8442, Oct. 23, 2009, 74 F.R. 55437, provided:
<br>
<br>America's forests have helped spur the growth and development that has been indispensable to our Nation's success. They have provided timber and water, as well as habitat for wildlife and opportunities for recreational activities. As a repository for renewable natural resources, forests have supplied the raw materials that have sustained us throughout our history. During National Forest Products Week, we recognize the value of our woodlands and commit ourselves to good stewardship and conservation practices that help us to responsibly manage our Nation's forests.
<br>
<br>As a renewable and recyclable resource, wood is one of our Nation's most environmentally friendly building materials. Wood fiber is used throughout our daily lives, from the paper we write on to the offices where we work. We value the beauty of wood in our furniture, in our homes, and in artwork that surrounds us. Today, modern technology and stewardship practices by Federal, State, tribal, and private landowners have improved the way we manage our natural resources so that forests can meet the needs of current and future generations.
<br>
<br>Forests are one of the foundations on which our Nation was formed; they are the backbone of our environment. This week, we recognize the value of forest products and the importance of their sustainable use to our lives.
<br>
<br>To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86–753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National Forest Products Week and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National Forest Products Week. I call on all Americans to celebrate the varied uses and products of our forested lands, as well as the people who carry on the tradition of careful stewardship of these precious natural resources for generations to come.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama.      
<br>§124. National Freedom Day

<br>Proc. No. 8484. National Poison Prevention Week
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 8484, Mar. 15, 2010, 75 F.R. 13215, provided:
<br>
<br>Since 1962, during National Poison Prevention Week we alert American families about the dangers of accidental poisonings and provide information on safety measures that can prevent senseless injuries and deaths. With nearly two million poison exposures reported each year, we must take every precaution to guard against these preventable tragedies.
<br>
<br>Sadly, more than half of all reported poisonings involve children under the age of six, and the vast majority take place in the home. Parents should keep household chemicals and medicines in child-proof containers, beyond the reach of their children. Thanks to safety regulations and awareness campaigns like National Poison Prevention Week, childhood death rates from unintentional poisonings have fallen considerably. However, adult death rates have steadily risen in recent years.
<br>
<br>We must each remember to read labels thoroughly before taking medications, to keep medicines in their original packaging, and to dispose of them properly. Consulting a physician before combining prescription drugs or using them with alcohol also reduces our risks.
<br>
<br>In the event of an accidental poisoning, crucial information and immediate action can save lives. Individuals can call the toll-free national poison control hotline at 1–800–222–1222 to be connected to one of dozens of local poison control centers, which are open 24 hours every day. These centers provide emergency assistance, offer guidance on poison prevention, and answer questions concerning potential exposure.
<br>
<br>To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as "National Poison Prevention Week."
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the third week of March of each year as National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous household materials and from the misuse of prescription medications.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama.

<br>
<br>"(13) in 2005, the American Bison Society was reestablished, bringing together bison ranchers, managers from Indian tribes, Federal and State agencies, conservation organizations, and natural and social scientists from the United States, Canada, and Mexico to create a vision for the North American bison in the 21st century;

<br>
<br>"(21) several sports teams have the bison as a mascot, which highlights the iconic significance of bison in the United States;

<br>Proc. No. 5574. The Rose Proclaimed the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 5574, Nov. 20, 1986, 51 F.R. 42197, provided:
<br>
<br>Americans have always loved the flowers with which God decorates our land. More often than any other flower, we hold the rose dear as the symbol of life and love and devotion, of beauty and eternity. For the love of man and woman, for the love of mankind and God, for the love of country, Americans who would speak the language of the heart do so with a rose.
<br>
<br>We see proofs of this everywhere. The study of fossils reveals that the rose has existed in America for age upon age. We have always cultivated roses in our gardens. Our first President, George Washington, bred roses, and a variety he named after his mother is still grown today. The White House itself boasts a beautiful Rose Garden. We grow roses in all our fifty States. We find roses throughout our art, music, and literature. We decorate our celebrations and parades with roses. Most of all, we present roses to those we love, and we lavish them on our altars, our civil shrines, and the final resting places of our honored dead.
<br>
<br>The American people have long held a special place in their hearts for roses. Let us continue to cherish them, to honor the love and devotion they represent, and to bestow them on all we love just as God has bestowed them on us.
<br>
<br>The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 159 [Pub. L. 99–449, now this section], has designated the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation declaring this fact.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
<br>
<br>Ronald Reagan.

<br>

<br>
<br>(5) there is great value in volunteer involvement in maintaining and preserving Federal lands for recreational use;
<br>
<br>(6) the Federal land management agencies should be concerned with promoting a sense of pride and ownership among citizens toward these lands;
