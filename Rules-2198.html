All reasonable and lawful means must be used to ensure that the United States will receive the best intelligence available. For that purpose, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (Act) [50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.], and as President of the United States of America, in order to provide for the effective conduct of United States intelligence activities and the protection of constitutional rights, it is hereby ordered as follows:

<br>
<br>(f) State, local, and tribal governments are critical partners in securing and defending the United States from terrorism and other threats to the United States and its interests.
