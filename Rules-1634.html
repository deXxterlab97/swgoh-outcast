<br>
<br>For purposes of laws relating to navigation on inland and intracoastal waterways of the United States, the term "rehabilitation" means—
<br>
<br>(1) major project feature restoration—
<br>
<br>(A) which consists of structural work on an inland navigation facility operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers;
<br>
<br>(B) which will significantly extend the physical life of the feature;
<br>
<br>(C) which is economically justified by a benefit-cost analysis;
<br>
<br>(D) which will take at least 2 years to complete; and
<br>
<br>(E)(i) which is initially funded before October 1, 1994, and will require at least $5,000,000 in capital outlays; or
<br>
<br>(ii) which is initially funded on or after such date and will require at least $20,000,000 in capital outlays; and
<br>
<br>(2) structural modification of a major project component (not exhibiting reliability problems)—
<br>
<br>(A) which will enhance the operational efficiency of such component or any other major component of the project by increasing benefits beyond the original project design; and
