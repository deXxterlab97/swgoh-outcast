<br>
<br>"(2) part-time permanent employment—

<br>
<br>(3) An employee with critical knowledge and skills (as defined by the Secretary concerned) may not participate in a voluntary separation under paragraph (1)(A) if the Secretary concerned determines that such participation would impair the performance of the mission of the Department of Defense or the military department concerned.

<br>
<br>(5) No authority under paragraph (1) may be exercised after September 30, 2018.

The words "in any civilian service of any Federal agency" are omitted as unnecessary because of the application stated in section 3501. In the second sentence, the word "total" in the phrase "length of service" is omitted for consistency with paragraph (3), and the words "subject to subsection (c) of this section" are omitted as unnecessary in view of the supplied distinction between a competing employee who is not a retired member of a uniformed service and such an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service. In paragraph (A), the words "total length of time in active service" are substituted for "length of time spent in active service" for consistency with paragraph (B)(ii).

<br>
<br>(1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position; and

The Office shall require a demonstration by the appointing authority that the notification was timely sent to the preference eligible's last known address and shall, before the selection of any other person for the position, make a final determination on the physical ability of the preference eligible to perform the duties of the position, taking into account any additional information provided in the response. When the Office has completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to the appointing authority and the preference eligible.
