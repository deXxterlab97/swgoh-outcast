<br>If an article of food covered by a recall order issued under paragraph (1)(B) has been distributed to a warehouse-based third party logistics provider without providing such provider sufficient information to know or reasonably determine the precise identity of the article of food covered by a recall order that is in its possession, the notice provided by the responsible party subject to the order issued under paragraph (1)(B) shall include such information as is necessary for the warehouse-based third party logistics provider to identify the food.
<br>(B) Rules of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed—
<br>
<br>(i) to exempt a warehouse-based third party logistics provider from the requirements of this chapter, including the requirements in this section and section 350c of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) to exempt a warehouse-based third party logistics provider from being the subject of a mandatory recall order.
<br>(3) Determination to limit areas affected
<br>
<br>If the Secretary requires a responsible party to cease distribution under paragraph (1)(A) of an article of food identified in subsection (a), the Secretary may limit the size of the geographic area and the markets affected by such cessation if such limitation would not compromise the public health.
<br>(c) Hearing on order
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide the responsible party subject to an order under subsection (b) with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held as soon as possible, but not later than 2 days after the issuance of the order, on the actions required by the order and on why the article that is the subject of the order should not be recalled.
<br>(d) Post-hearing recall order and modification of order
<br>(1) Amendment of order
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) specify a timetable in which the recall shall occur;
<br>
<br>(C) require periodic reports to the Secretary describing the progress of the recall; and
<br>
<br>(D) provide notice to consumers to whom such article was, or may have been, distributed.
<br>(2) Vacating of order
<br>
<br>If, after such hearing, the Secretary determines that adequate grounds do not exist to continue the actions required by the order, or that such actions should be modified, the Secretary shall vacate the order or modify the order.
<br>(e) Rule regarding alcoholic beverages
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not initiate a mandatory recall or take any other action under this section with respect to any alcohol beverage until the Secretary has provided the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau with a reasonable opportunity to cease distribution and recall such article under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau authority.
<br>(f) Cooperation and consultation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall work with State and local public health officials in carrying out this section, as appropriate.
<br>(g) Public notification
<br>

<br>(A) of the recall to consumers and retailers to whom such article was, or may have been, distributed; and
<br>
<br>(B) that includes, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(i) the name of the article of food subject to the recall;
<br>
<br>(ii) a description of the risk associated with such article; and
<br>
<br>(iii) to the extent practicable, information for consumers about similar articles of food that are not affected by the recall;
<br>
<br>(2) consult the policies of the Department of Agriculture regarding providing to the public a list of retail consignees receiving products involved in a Class I recall and shall consider providing such a list to the public, as determined appropriate by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(3) if available, publish on the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration an image of the article that is the subject of the press release described in (1).2
<br>(h) No delegation
<br>
<br>The authority conferred by this section to order a recall or vacate a recall order shall not be delegated to any officer or employee other than the Commissioner.
<br>(i) Effect
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the Secretary to request or participate in a voluntary recall, or to issue an order to cease distribution or to recall under any other provision of this chapter or under the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.].
<br>(j) Coordinated communication

<br>SUBCHAPTER V—DRUGS AND DEVICES
<br>Part A—Drugs and Devices
<br>§351. Adulterated drugs and devices
<br>
<br>A drug or device shall be deemed to be adulterated—
<br>(a) Poisonous, insanitary, etc., ingredients; adequate controls in manufacture
<br>
<br>(1) If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance; or (2)(A) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; or (B) if it is a drug and the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess; or (C) if it is a compounded positron emission tomography drug and the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, its compounding, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with the positron emission tomography compounding standards and the official monographs of the United States Pharmacopoeia to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, that it purports or is represented to possess; or (3) if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; or (4) if (A) it bears or contains, for purposes of coloring only, a color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of section 379e(a) of this title, or (B) it is a color additive the intended use of which in or on drugs or devices is for purposes of coloring only and is unsafe within the meaning of section 379e(a) of this title; or (5) if it is a new animal drug which is unsafe within the meaning of section 360b of this title; or (6) if it is an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, and such animal feed is unsafe within the meaning of section 360b of this title.
<br>(b) Strength, quality, or purity differing from official compendium
<br>
<br>If it purports to be or is represented as a drug the name of which is recognized in an official compendium, and its strength differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, the standard set forth in such compendium. Such determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made in accordance with the tests or methods of assay set forth in such compendium, except that whenever tests or methods of assay have not been prescribed in such compendium, or such tests or methods of assay as are prescribed are, in the judgment of the Secretary, insufficient for the making of such determination, the Secretary shall bring such fact to the attention of the appropriate body charged with the revision of such compendium, and if such body fails within a reasonable time to prescribe tests or methods of assay which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are sufficient for purposes of this paragraph, then the Secretary shall promulgate regulations prescribing appropriate tests or methods of assay in accordance with which such determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made. No drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be adulterated under this paragraph because it differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity therefor set forth in such compendium, if its difference in strength, quality, or purity from such standard is plainly stated on its label. Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United States Pharmacopoeia.
<br>(c) Misrepresentation of strength, etc., where drug is unrecognized in compendium
<br>
<br>If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and its strength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess.
<br>(d) Mixture with or substitution of another substance
<br>
<br>If it is a drug and any substance has been (1) mixed or packed therewith so as to reduce its quality or strength or (2) substituted wholly or in part therefor.
<br>(e) Devices not in conformity with performance standards
<br>
<br>(1) If it is, or purports to be or is represented as, a device which is subject to a performance standard established under section 360d of this title unless such device is in all respects in conformity with such standard.
<br>
<br>(2) If it is declared to be, purports to be, or is represented as, a device that is in conformity with any standard recognized under section 360d(c) of this title unless such device is in all respects in conformity with such standard.
<br>(f) Certain class III devices
<br>
<br>(1) If it is a class III device—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) which is required by an order issued under subsection (b) of section 360e of this title to have an approval under such section of an application for premarket approval and which is not exempt from section 360e of this title under section 360j(g) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) for which an application for premarket approval or a notice of completion of a product development protocol was not filed with the Secretary within the ninety-day period beginning on the date of the issuance of such order, or
<br>
<br>(II) for which such an application was filed and approval of the application has been denied, suspended, or withdrawn, or such a notice was filed and has been declared not completed or the approval of the device under the protocol has been withdrawn;
<br>
<br>(B)(i) which was classified under section 360c(f) of this title into class III, which under section 360e(a) of this title is required to have in effect an approved application for premarket approval, and which is not exempt from section 360e of this title under section 360j(g) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(ii) which has an application which has been suspended or is otherwise not in effect; or
<br>
<br>(C) which was classified under section 360j(l) of this title into class III, which under such section is required to have in effect an approved application under section 360e of this title, and which has an application which has been suspended or is otherwise not in effect.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In the case of a device classified under section 360c(f) of this title into class III and intended solely for investigational use, paragraph 1 (1)(B) shall not apply with respect to such device during the period ending on the ninetieth day after the date of the promulgation of the regulations prescribing the procedures and conditions required by section 360j(g)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of a device subject to an order issued under subsection (b) of section 360e of this title, paragraph 1 (1) shall not apply with respect to such device during the period ending—
<br>
<br>(i) on the last day of the thirtieth calendar month beginning after the month in which the classification of the device in class III became effective under section 360c of this title, or
<br>
<br>(ii) on the ninetieth day after the date of the issuance of such order,
<br>
<br>whichever occurs later.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of a device with respect to which a regulation was promulgated under section 360e(b) of this title prior to July 9, 2012, a reference in this subsection to an order issued under section 360e(b) of this title shall be deemed to include such regulation.
<br>(g) Banned devices
<br>
<br>If it is a banned device.
<br>(h) Manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of device not in conformity with applicable requirements or conditions
<br>
<br>If it is a device and the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with applicable requirements under section 360j(f)(1) of this title or an applicable condition prescribed by an order under section 360j(f)(2) of this title.
<br>(i) Failure to comply with requirements under which device was exempted for investigational use
<br>
<br>If it is a device for which an exemption has been granted under section 360j(g) of this title for investigational use and the person who was granted such exemption or any investigator who uses such device under such exemption fails to comply with a requirement prescribed by or under such section.
<br>(j) Delayed, denied, or limited inspection; refusal to permit entry or inspection
<br>
<br>If it is a drug or device and it has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(B), the term "current good manufacturing practice" includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.

<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "subparagraph".
<br>§352. Misbranded drugs and devices
<br>
<br>A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded—
<br>(a) False or misleading label
<br>
<br>(1) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Health care economic information provided to a payor, formulary committee, or other similar entity with knowledge and expertise in the area of health care economic analysis, carrying out its responsibilities for the selection of drugs for coverage or reimbursement, shall not be considered to be false or misleading under this paragraph if the health care economic information relates to an indication approved under section 355 of this title or under section 262(a) of title 42 for such drug, is based on competent and reliable scientific evidence, and includes, where applicable, a conspicuous and prominent statement describing any material differences between the health care economic information and the labeling approved for the drug under section 355 of this title or under section 262 of title 42. The requirements set forth in section 355(a) of this title or in subsections (a) and (k) of section 262 of title 42 shall not apply to health care economic information provided to such a payor, committee, or entity in accordance with this paragraph. Information that is relevant to the substantiation of the health care economic information presented pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available to the Secretary upon request.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) For purposes of this paragraph,1 the term "health care economic information" means any analysis (including the clinical data, inputs, clinical or other assumptions, methods, results, and other components underlying or comprising the analysis) that identifies, measures, or describes the economic consequences, which may be based on the separate or aggregated clinical consequences of the represented health outcomes, of the use of a drug. Such analysis may be comparative to the use of another drug, to another health care intervention, or to no intervention.
<br>
<br>(B) Such term does not include any analysis that relates only to an indication that is not approved under section 355 of this title or under section 262 of title 42 for such drug.
<br>(b) Package form; contents of label
<br>
<br>If in package form unless it bears a label containing (1) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; and (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided, That under clause (2) of this paragraph reasonable variations shall be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
<br>(c) Prominence of information on label
<br>
<br>If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
<br>(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 105–115, title I, §126(b), Nov. 21, 1997, 111 Stat. 2327
<br>(e) Designation of drugs or devices by established names
<br>
<br>(1)(A) If it is a drug, unless its label bears, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical formula)—
<br>
<br>(i) the established name (as defined in subparagraph (3)) of the drug, if there is such a name;
<br>
<br>(ii) the established name and quantity or, if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, the proportion of each active ingredient, including the quantity, kind, and proportion of any alcohol, and also including whether active or not the established name and quantity or if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, the proportion of any bromides, ether, chloroform, acetanilide, acetophenetidin, amidopyrine, antipyrine, atropine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, arsenic, digitalis, digitalis glucosides, mercury, ouabain, strophanthin, strychnine, thyroid, or any derivative or preparation of any such substances, contained therein, except that the requirement for stating the quantity of the active ingredients, other than the quantity of those specifically named in this subclause, shall not apply to nonprescription drugs not intended for human use; and
<br>
