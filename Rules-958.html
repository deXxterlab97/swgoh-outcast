<br>SUBCHAPTER XIII—NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN
<br>§80q. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) there is no national museum devoted exclusively to the history and art of cultures indigenous to the Americas;
<br>
<br>(2) although the Smithsonian Institution sponsors extensive Native American programs, none of its 19 museums, galleries, and major research facilities is devoted exclusively to Native American history and art;
<br>
<br>(3) the Heye Museum in New York, New York, one of the largest Native American collections in the world, has more than 1,000,000 art objects and artifacts and a library of 40,000 volumes relating to the archaeology, ethnology, and history of Native American peoples;
<br>
<br>(4) the Heye Museum is housed in facilities with a total area of 90,000 square feet, but requires a minimum of 400,000 square feet for exhibition, storage, and scholarly research;
<br>
<br>(5) the bringing together of the Heye Museum collection and the Native American collection of the Smithsonian Institution would—
<br>
<br>(A) create a national institution with unrivaled capability for exhibition and research;
<br>
<br>(B) give all Americans the opportunity to learn of the cultural legacy, historic grandeur, and contemporary culture of Native Americans;
<br>
<br>(C) provide facilities for scholarly meetings and the performing arts;
<br>
<br>(D) make available curatorial and other learning opportunities for Indians; and
<br>
<br>(E) make possible traveling exhibitions to communities throughout the Nation;
<br>
<br>(6) by order of the Surgeon General of the Army, approximately 4,000 Indian human remains from battlefields and burial sites were sent to the Army Medical Museum and were later transferred to the Smithsonian Institution;
<br>
<br>(7) through archaeological excavations, individual donations, and museum donations, the Smithsonian Institution has acquired approximately 14,000 additional Indian human remains;
<br>
<br>(8) the human remains referred to in paragraphs (6) and (7) have long been a matter of concern for many Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Villages, and Native Hawaiian communities which are determined to provide an appropriate resting place for their ancestors;
<br>
<br>(9) identification of the origins of such human remains is essential to addressing that concern; and
<br>
<br>(10) an extraordinary site on the National Mall in the District of Columbia (U.S. Government Reservation No. 6) is reserved for the use of the Smithsonian Institution and is available for construction of the National Museum of the American Indian.

<br>

<br>"SEC. 4. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND USE OF NAME.
<br>
<br>"(a) Responsibility of National Congress of American Indians and National Museum of the American Indian.—The National Congress of American Indians and the National Museum of the American Indian shall be responsible for acceptance of contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the establishment of the memorial. No Federal funds may be used to pay any expense of the establishment of the memorial.

<br>(b) Repatriation
<br>
<br>Where cultural affiliation of Native American unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony has been established in the summary prepared pursuant to subsection (a), or where a requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show cultural affiliation by a preponderance of the evidence based upon geographical, kinship, biological, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric, oral traditional, historical, or other relevant information or expert opinion, then the Smithsonian Institution shall expeditiously return such unassociated funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony where—

<br>If a known lineal descendant or an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization requests the return of Native American unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony pursuant to this subchapter and presents evidence which, if standing alone before the introduction of evidence to the contrary, would support a finding that the Smithsonian Institution did not have the right of possession, then the Smithsonian Institution shall return such objects unless it can overcome such inference and prove that it has a right of possession to the objects.
<br>(d) Museum obligation
<br>
<br>Any museum of the Smithsonian Institution which repatriates any item in good faith pursuant to this subchapter shall not be liable for claims by an aggrieved party or for claims of fiduciary duty, public trust, or violations of applicable law that are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter.
<br>(e) Statutory construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with respect to any museum of the Smithsonian Institution, from making an inventory or preparing a written summary or carrying out the repatriation of unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony in a manner that exceeds the requirements of this subchapter.
