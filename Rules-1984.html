<br>In making grants under subsection (a), the Secretary shall take into consideration the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Factors that contribute to infant mortality, including poor birth outcomes (such as low birthweight and preterm birth) and social determinants of health.
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) The ability of grantees to improve health outcomes for project participants, promote the awareness of the Healthy Start program services, incorporate and promote family participation, facilitate coordination with the community in which the grantee is located, and increase grantee accountability through quality improvement, performance monitoring, evaluation, and the effect such metrics may have toward decreasing the rate of infant mortality and improving perinatal outcomes.
