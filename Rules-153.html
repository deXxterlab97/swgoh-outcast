<br>Statutes at Large
<br>(a) 	5 U.S.C. 638 (less applicability to appointment and promotion). 	Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, §7 (less applicability to appointment and promotion), 22 Stat. 406.
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is restated in the form of a definition.
<br>
<br>Subsection (a)(1) is based on former section 638, which placed positions in the executive branch of the Government generally in the competitive service by the requirement that employment be predicated on passing an examination or being exempted from examination, and section 1 of the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, 54 Stat. 1211 (see table III), which authorized the President, subject to certain exceptions, to place in the classified civil service positions in the Executive departments, independent establishments, and other agencies of the Government. In that Act the word "executive" has been construed to modify "departments", "independent establishments"; and "other agency". This construction is supported by the language of the Act of Jan. 16, 1883, and is embodied in Civil Service Rule I. Acting under this statute, the President has placed all but a comparatively few of the positions covered by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, in the competitive service. The remainder are covered by the exceptions contained in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The authority of the President conferred by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, has been superseded in part by exceptions created by statutes enacted after that date. The effect of these exceptions and the power conferred on the President by former section 633(2)8 (last sentence) to make exceptions to the Civil Service Rules are preserved by the words "positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute".
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words "or to pass an examination" are omitted as covered by the exclusion from the "competitive service".
<br>
<br>Subsection (a)(2) preserves the exception stated in former section 638 modified to recognize the several statutory exceptions to this exception that have been enacted. The language of former section 638 relative to examination is codified in sections 3304(b) and 3361. The reference to veterans' preference is omitted because the statute referred to, R.S. §1754, was superseded by sections 3 and 21 of the Act of June 18, 1929, ch. 28, 46 Stat. 21. Section 3 of the Act of June 18, 1929, was superseded by the Act of June 27, 1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, as amended, which is carried into this title. Rights preserved by section 18 of the Act of June 27, 1944, are further preserved by technical section 8. The exception for laborers and workmen was superseded by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is added because of the provisions in section 3311 of title 39.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) is supplied for conformity inasmuch as the terms are coextensive by definition.
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see section 201 of Title 29 and Tables.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2013—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 113–66 substituted "Navy Ships Stores Program" for "Army and Air Force Motion Picture Service, Navy Ship's Stores Ashore" in introductory provisions.

<br>
<br>1996—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104–201 inserted "who is" after "An individual" and "and whose employment in such a position began before October 1, 1996, and has been uninterrupted in such a position since that date" after "Academy dairy,".
<br>
<br>1994—Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 103–424 added subsec. (f).
<br>
<br>1993—Subsec. (c)(1)(E). Pub. L. 103–3 added subpar. (E).
<br>
<br>1990—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 101–508, §7202(b)(1), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: "laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title, and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 101–508, §7202(b)(2), inserted "(except to the extent specifically provided therein)" after "chapter 84".
<br>
<br>1986—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 99–638 inserted "of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title,".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 99–335 substituted "chapter 81, chapter 84," for "chapter 81".
<br>
<br>1979—Subsec. (a)(1)(F). Pub. L. 96–54, §2(a)(5), substituted "an adjutant" for "the adjutants" and struck out ", United States Code" after "32".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 96–54, §2(a)(6), amended subsec. (c)(1) in same manner as amendment by section 703(c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454. See 1978 Amendment note set out below.
<br>
<br>1978—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 95–454 substituted "7204" for "7154", and "Office of Personnel Management" for "Civil Service Commission". Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend section 3302(2) of this title. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95–454, §703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by Pub. L. 95–454, §703(c)(2) was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to section 3302(2) of this title as the probable intent of Congress.
<br>
<br>1972—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 92–392 substituted "laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 and sections 5550 and 7154 of this title)" for "laws".

<br>
<br>1968—Subsec. (a)(1)(F). Pub. L. 90–486 added subpar. (F).

<br>
<br>(2) All employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition, and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.
<br>
<br>(3) Equal pay should be provided for work of equal value, with appropriate consideration of both national and local rates paid by employers in the private sector, and appropriate incentives and recognition should be provided for excellence in performance.
<br>
<br>(4) All employees should maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public interest.
<br>
<br>(5) The Federal work force should be used efficiently and effectively.

<br>(B) prohibited from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or a nomination for election.
<br>
<br>(9) Employees should be protected against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences—
<br>
<br>(A) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or
<br>
<br>(B) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.
<br>
<br>(c) In administering the provisions of this chapter—
<br>
<br>(1) with respect to any agency (as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(C) of this title), the President shall, pursuant to the authority otherwise available under this title, take any action, including the issuance of rules, regulations, or directives; and
<br>

<br>
<br>which is consistent with the provisions of this title and which the President or the head, as the case may be, determines is necessary to ensure that personnel management is based on and embodies the merit system principles.

<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the 'Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Table of Contents.—[Omitted.]
<br>"TITLE I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>"SEC. 101. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, including representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;
<br>
<br>"(3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;
<br>
<br>"(4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation found that the Environmental Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and for helping Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities;
<br>
<br>"(5) there have been several recent class action suits based on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service, the Department of Agriculture, the United States Information Agency, and the Social Security Administration;
<br>
<br>"(6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal agency compliance with the law;
<br>
<br>"(7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; and
<br>
<br>"(8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or settlement should improve agency accountability with respect to discrimination and whistleblower laws.
<br>"SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;
<br>
<br>"(2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower incident should not be compromised;
<br>
<br>"(3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;
<br>
<br>"(4) accountability in the enforcement of the rights of Federal employees is furthered when Federal agencies agree to take appropriate disciplinary action against Federal employees who are found to have intentionally committed discriminatory (including retaliatory) acts;
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) accountability is not furthered if Federal agencies react to the increased accountability under this Act for what, by law, the agency is responsible by taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by violating the procedural rights of managers who have been accused of discrimination; and
<br>
<br>"(B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce and in dispute resolution and other essential communication skills; and
<br>
<br>"(6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under this Act; and
<br>
<br>"(B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual appropriations for that agency, may need to extend reimbursement over several years in order to avoid—
<br>
<br>"(i) reductions in force;
<br>
<br>"(ii) furloughs;
<br>
<br>"(iii) other reductions in compensation or benefits for the workforce of the agency; or
<br>
<br>"(iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agency.
<br>"SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.
<br>
<br>"For purposes of this Act—
<br>
