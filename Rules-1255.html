<br>§9001. Findings and declarations
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The international abduction or wrongful retention of children is harmful to their well-being.
<br>
<br>(2) Persons should not be permitted to obtain custody of children by virtue of their wrongful removal or retention.
<br>
<br>(3) International abductions and retentions of children are increasing, and only concerted cooperation pursuant to an international agreement can effectively combat this problem.
<br>
<br>(4) The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, done at The Hague on October 25, 1980, establishes legal rights and procedures for the prompt return of children who have been wrongfully removed or retained, as well as for securing the exercise of visitation rights. Children who are wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the Convention are to be promptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set forth in the Convention applies. The Convention provides a sound treaty framework to help resolve the problem of international abduction and retention of children and will deter such wrongful removals and retentions.
<br>(b) Declarations
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following declarations:
<br>
<br>(1) It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures for the implementation of the Convention in the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) The provisions of this chapter are in addition to and not in lieu of the provisions of the Convention.
<br>
<br>(3) In enacting this chapter the Congress recognizes—
<br>
<br>(A) the international character of the Convention; and
<br>
<br>(B) the need for uniform international interpretation of the Convention.
<br>
<br>(4) The Convention and this chapter empower courts in the United States to determine only rights under the Convention and not the merits of any underlying child custody claims.

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12648, Aug. 11, 1988, 53 F.R. 30637, provided:
<br>
<br>The United States of America deposited its instrument of ratification of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ("Convention") on April 29, 1988. The Convention entered into force for the United States on July 1, 1988. Article 6 of the Convention imposes upon Contracting States an obligation to designate a "Central Authority" for the purpose of discharging certain specified functions.
<br>
<br>In order that the Government of the United States of America may give full and complete effect to the Convention, and pursuant to section 7 of the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, Public Law No. 100–300 (1988) [22 U.S.C. 9006], it is expedient and necessary that I designate a Central Authority within the Executive branch of said Government:
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code and section 7 of the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, it is ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Designation of Central Authority. The Department of State is hereby designated as the Central Authority of the United States for purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and empowered, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, to perform all lawful acts that may be necessary and proper in order to execute the functions of the Central Authority in a timely and efficient manner.

<br>(b) Costs incurred in civil actions
<br>
<br>(1) Petitioners may be required to bear the costs of legal counsel or advisors, court costs incurred in connection with their petitions, and travel costs for the return of the child involved and any accompanying persons, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3).
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to paragraph (3), legal fees or court costs incurred in connection with an action brought under section 9003 of this title shall be borne by the petitioner unless they are covered by payments from Federal, State, or local legal assistance or other programs.
<br>
<br>(3) Any court ordering the return of a child pursuant to an action brought under section 9003 of this title shall order the respondent to pay necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the petitioner, including court costs, legal fees, foster home or other care during the course of proceedings in the action, and transportation costs related to the return of the child, unless the respondent establishes that such order would be clearly inappropriate.

<br>In performing its functions under the Convention, the United States Central Authority may, under such conditions as the Central Authority prescribes by regulation, but subject to subsection (c), receive from or transmit to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government or of any State or foreign government, and receive from or transmit to any applicant, petitioner, or respondent, information necessary to locate a child or for the purpose of otherwise implementing the Convention with respect to a child, except that the United States Central Authority—
<br>
<br>(1) may receive such information from a Federal or State department, agency, or instrumentality only pursuant to applicable Federal and State statutes; and
<br>
<br>(2) may transmit any information received under this subsection notwithstanding any provision of law other than this chapter.

<br>
<br>Whenever any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of any State receives a request from the United States Central Authority for information authorized to be provided to such Central Authority under subsection (a), the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall promptly cause a search to be made of the files and records maintained by such department, agency, or instrumentality in order to determine whether the information requested is contained in any such files or records. If such search discloses the information requested, the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall immediately transmit such information to the United States Central Authority, except that any such information the disclosure of which—
<br>
<br>(1) would adversely affect the national security interests of the United States or the law enforcement interests of the United States or of any State; or
<br>
<br>(2) would be prohibited by section 9 of title 13;
<br>
<br>shall not be transmitted to the Central Authority. The head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall, immediately upon completion of the requested search, notify the Central Authority of the results of the search, and whether an exception set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) applies. In the event that the United States Central Authority receives information and the appropriate Federal or State department, agency, or instrumentality thereafter notifies the Central Authority that an exception set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) applies to that information, the Central Authority may not disclose that information under subsection (a).
<br>(d) Information available from Parent Locator Service
<br>
<br>To the extent that information which the United States Central Authority is authorized to obtain under the provisions of subsection (c) can be obtained through the Parent Locator Service, the United States Central Authority shall first seek to obtain such information from the Parent Locator Service, before requesting such information directly under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.
<br>(e) Recordkeeping
<br>
<br>The United States Central Authority shall maintain appropriate records concerning its activities and the disposition of cases brought to its attention.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 113–150, §1(a), Aug. 8, 2014, 128 Stat. 1807, provided that: "This Act [enacting this chapter and section 241 of Title 6, Domestic Security, repealing section 11611 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, and enacting provisions set out as a note under this section] may be cited as the 'Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act of 2014'."
<br>Findings; Sense of Congress; Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 113–150, §2, Aug. 8, 2014, 128 Stat. 1807, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Sean Goldman, a United States citizen and resident of New Jersey, was abducted from the United States in 2004 and separated from his father, David Goldman, who spent nearly 6 years battling for the return of his son from Brazil before Sean was finally returned to Mr. Goldman's custody on December 24, 2009.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Department of State's Office of Children's Issues, which serves as the Central Authority of the United States for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (referred to in this Act [see Short Title note above] as the 'Hague Abduction Convention'), has received thousands of requests since 2007 for assistance in the return to the United States of children who have been wrongfully abducted by a parent or other legal guardian to another country.
<br>
<br>"(3) For a variety of reasons reflecting the significant obstacles to the recovery of abducted children, as well as the legal and factual complexity involving such cases, not all cases are reported to the Central Authority of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(4) More than 1,000 outgoing international child abductions are reported every year to the Central Authority of the United States, which depends solely on proactive reporting of abduction cases.
<br>
<br>"(5) Only about one-half of the children abducted from the United States to countries with which the United States enjoys reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction Convention are returned to the United States.
<br>
<br>"(6) The United States and other Convention countries have expressed their desire, through the Hague Abduction Convention, 'to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access.'
<br>
<br>"(7) Compliance by the United States and other Convention countries depends on the actions of their designated central authorities, the performance of their judicial systems as reflected in the legal process and decisions rendered to enforce or effectuate the Hague Abduction Convention, and the ability and willingness of their law enforcement authorities to ensure the swift enforcement of orders rendered pursuant to the Hague Abduction Convention.
<br>
<br>"(8) According to data from the Department of State, approximately 40 percent of abduction cases involve children taken from the United States to countries with which the United States does not have reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction Convention or other arrangements relating to the resolution of abduction cases.
<br>
<br>"(9) According to the Department of State's April 2010 Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 'parental child abduction jeopardizes the child and has substantial long-term consequences for both the child and the left-behind parent.'
<br>
<br>"(10) Few left-behind parents have the extraordinary financial resources necessary—
<br>
<br>"(A) to pursue individual civil or criminal remedies in both the United States and a foreign country, even if such remedies are available; or
<br>
<br>"(B) to engage in repeated foreign travel to attempt to obtain the return of their children through diplomatic or other channels.
<br>
<br>"(11) Military parents often face additional complications in resolving abduction cases because of the challenges presented by their military obligations.
<br>
<br>"(12) In addition to using the Hague Abduction Convention to achieve the return of abducted children, the United States has an array of Federal, State, and local law enforcement, criminal justice, and judicial tools at its disposal to prevent international abductions.
<br>
<br>"(13) Federal agencies tasked with preventing international abductions have indicated that the most effective way to stop international child abductions is while they are in progress, rather than after the child has been removed to a foreign destination.
<br>
<br>"(14) Parental awareness of abductions in progress, rapid response by relevant law enforcement, and effective coordination among Federal, State, local, and international stakeholders are critical in preventing such abductions.
<br>
<br>"(15) A more robust application of domestic tools, in cooperation with international law enforcement entities and appropriate application of the Hague Abduction Convention could—
<br>
<br>"(A) discourage some parents from attempting abductions;
<br>
<br>"(B) block attempted abductions at ports of exit; and
<br>
<br>"(C) help achieve the return of more abducted children.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the United States should set a strong example for other Convention countries in the timely location and prompt resolution of cases involving children abducted abroad and brought to the United States.
<br>
<br>"(c) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act [see Short Title note above] are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to protect children whose habitual residence is the United States from wrongful abduction;
<br>
<br>"(2) to assist left-behind parents in quickly resolving cases and maintaining safe and predictable contact with their child while an abduction case is pending;
<br>
<br>"(3) to protect the custodial rights of parents, including military parents, by providing the parents, the judicial system, and law enforcement authorities with the information they need to prevent unlawful abduction before it occurs;
<br>
<br>"(4) to enhance the prompt resolution of abduction and access cases;
<br>
<br>"(5) to detail an appropriate set of actions to be undertaken by the Secretary of State to address persistent problems in the resolution of abduction cases;
<br>
<br>"(6) to establish a program to prevent wrongful abductions; and
<br>
<br>"(7) to increase interagency coordination in preventing international child abduction by convening a working group composed of presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed officials from the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice."

<br>(1) to oppose institutional or other systemic failures of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the Hague Abduction Convention or bilateral procedures, as applicable, to resolve abduction and access cases;
<br>
<br>(2) to promote reciprocity pursuant to, and in compliance with, the Hague Abduction Convention or bilateral procedures, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(3) to directly engage with senior foreign government officials to most effectively address patterns of noncompliance.
<br>(b) Determination of countries with patterns of noncompliance in cases of international child abduction
<br>(1) Annual review
<br>
<br>Not later than April 30 of each year, the Secretary of State shall—

<br>(2) Authority for delay of actions by the Secretary of State
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not be required to take action under paragraph (1) until the expiration of a single, additional period of up to 90 days if, on or before the date on which the Secretary of State is required to take such action, the Secretary determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that such additional period is necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) for a continuation of negotiations that have been commenced with the government of a country described in paragraph (1) in order to bring about a cessation of the pattern of noncompliance by such country;
<br>
<br>(B) for a review of corrective action taken by a country after the designation of such country as being engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under subsection (b)(1)(A); or
<br>
<br>(C) in anticipation that corrective action will be taken by such country during such 90-day period.
<br>(3) Exception for additional action by the Secretary of State
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State shall not be required to take additional action under paragraph (1) with respect to a country determined to have been engaged in a persistent pattern of noncompliance if the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) has taken action pursuant to paragraph (5), (6), or (7) of subsection (d) with respect to such country in the preceding year and such action continues to be in effect;
<br>
<br>(B) exercises the waiver under section 9124 of this title and briefs the appropriate congressional committees; or
<br>
<br>(C) submits a report to the appropriate congressional committees that—
<br>
<br>(i) indicates that such country is subject to multiple, broad-based sanctions; and
<br>
<br>(ii) describes how such sanctions satisfy the requirements under this subsection.
<br>(4) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after the submission of the Annual Report, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the specific actions taken against countries determined to have been engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under this section.
