<br>§1604. Enrollment

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prepare within two years from December 18, 1971, a roll of all Natives who were born on or before, and who are living on, December 18, 1971. Any decision of the Secretary regarding eligibility for enrollment shall be final.
<br>(b) Residence; order of priority in enrollment of Natives not permanent residents; regional family or hardship enrollment
<br>
<br>The roll prepared by the Secretary shall show for each Native, among other things, the region and the village or other place in which he resided on the date of the 1970 census enumeration, and he shall be enrolled according to such residence. Except as provided in subsection (c), a Native eligible for enrollment who is not, when the roll is prepared, a permanent resident of one of the twelve regions established pursuant to section 1606(a) of this title shall be enrolled by the Secretary in one of the twelve regions, giving priority in the following order to—
<br>
<br>(1) the region where the Native resided on the 1970 census date if he had resided there without substantial interruption for two or more years;
<br>
<br>(2) the region where the Native previously resided for an aggregate of ten years or more;
<br>
<br>(3) the region where the Native was born; and
<br>
<br>(4) the region from which an ancestor of the Native came: 1
<br>
<br>The Secretary may enroll a Native in a different region when necessary to avoid enrolling members of the same family in different regions or otherwise avoid hardship.
<br>(c) Election of enrollment in thirteenth region, if established, of Native nonresidents; dependent household members as bound
<br>
<br>A Native eligible for enrollment who is eighteen years of age or older and is not a permanent resident of one of the twelve regions may, on the date he files an application for enrollment, elect to be enrolled in a thirteenth region for Natives who are non-residents of Alaska, if such region is established pursuant to section 1606(c) of this title. If such region is not established, he shall be enrolled as provided in subsection (b). His election shall apply to all dependent members of his household who are less than eighteen years of age, but shall not affect the enrollment of anyone else.

The respective shares of the State and the United States shall be calculated on the remaining balance.
<br>(e) Federal enforcement; State underpayment: deductions from grants-in-aid or other Federal assistance equal to underpayment and deposit of such amount in Fund
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall be enforceable by the United States for the benefit of the Natives, and in the event of default by the State in making the payments required, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, there shall be deducted annually by the Secretary of the Treasury from any grant-in-aid or from any other sums payable to the State under any provision of Federal law an amount equal to any such underpayment, which amount shall be deposited in the Fund.
<br>(f) Oil and gas revenues; amount payable equal to Federal or State royalties in cash or kind
<br>
<br>Revenues received by the United States or the State as compensation for estimated drainage of oil or gas shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as revenues from the disposition of oil and gas. In the event the United States or the State elects to take royalties in kind, there shall be paid into the Fund on account thereof an amount equal to the royalties that would have been paid into the Fund under the provisions of this section had the royalty been taken in cash.
<br>(g) Alaska Native Fund payments; cessation; reimbursement for advance payments
<br>
<br>The payments required by this section shall continue only until a sum of $500,000,000 has been paid into the Alaska Native Fund less the total of advance payments paid into the Alaska Native Fund pursuant to section 407 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. Thereafter, payments which would otherwise go into the Alaska Native Fund will be made to the United States Treasury as reimbursement for the advance payments authorized by section 407 of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act. The provisions of this section shall no longer apply, and the reservation required in patents under this section shall be of no further force and effect, after a total sum of $500,000,000 has been paid to the Alaska Native Fund and to the United States Treasury pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(h) Final payment; order of computation
<br>
<br>When computing the final payment into the Fund the respective shares of the United States and the State with respect to payments to the Fund required by this section shall be determined pursuant to this subsection and in the following order:
<br>
<br>(1) first, from sources identified under subsections (b) and (c) hereof; and
<br>
<br>(2) then, from sources identified under subsection (d) hereof.
<br>(i) Outer Continental Shelf mineral revenues; provisions of section inapplicable
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section do not apply to mineral revenues received from the Outer Continental Shelf.

<br>§1609. Limitation of actions
<br>(a) Complaint, time for filing; jurisdiction; commencement by State official; certainty and finality of vested rights, titles, and interests
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within one year of December 18, 1971, and no such action shall be entertained unless it is commenced by a duly authorized official of the State. Exclusive jurisdiction over such action is hereby vested in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The purpose of this limitation on suits is to insure that, after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, the right, title, and interest of the United States, the Natives, and the State of Alaska will vest with certainty and finality and may be relied upon by all other persons in their relations with the State, the Natives, and the United States.
<br>(b) Land selection; suspension and extension of rights
<br>
<br>In the event that the State initiates litigation or voluntarily becomes a party to litigation to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter, all rights of land selection granted to the State by the Alaska Statehood Act shall be suspended as to any public lands which are determined by the Secretary to be potentially valuable for mineral development, timber, or other commercial purposes, and no selections shall be made, no tentative approvals shall be granted, and no patents shall be issued for such lands during the pendency of such litigation. In the event of such suspension, the State's right of land selection pursuant to section 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time the selection right was suspended.

<br>(1) The following public lands are withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, and from selection under the Alaska Statehood Act, as amended:
<br>
<br>(A) The lands in each township that encloses all or part of any Native village identified pursuant to subsection (b);
<br>
<br>(B) The lands in each township that is contiguous to or corners on the township that encloses all or part of such Native village; and
<br>
<br>(C) The lands in each township that is contiguous to or corners on a township containing lands withdrawn by paragraph (B) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>The following lands are excepted from such withdrawal: lands in the National Park System and lands withdrawn or reserved for national defense purposes other than Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4.
<br>
<br>(2) All lands located within the townships described in subsection (a)(1) hereof that have been selected by, or tentatively approved to, but not yet patented to, the State under the Alaska Statehood Act are withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, and from the creation of third party interests by the State under the Alaska Statehood Act.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the Secretary determines that the lands withdrawn by subsections (a)(1) and (2) hereof are insufficient to permit a Village or Regional Corporation to select the acreage it is entitled to select, the Secretary shall withdraw three times the deficiency from the nearest unreserved, vacant and unappropriated public lands. In making this withdrawal the Secretary shall, insofar as possible, withdraw public lands of a character similar to those on which the village is located and in order of their proximity to the center of the Native village: Provided, That if the Secretary, pursuant to section 1616, and 1621(e) of this title determines there is a need to expand the boundaries of a National Wildlife Refuge to replace any acreage selected in the Wildlife Refuge System by the Village Corporation the withdrawal under this section shall not include lands in the Refuge.
