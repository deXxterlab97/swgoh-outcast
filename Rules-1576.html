<br>
<br>"(1) more than 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability companies are being formed under the laws of the States each year;
<br>
<br>"(2) most or all States do not require information about the beneficial owners of the corporations, limited liability companies, or other similar entities formed under the laws of the State;
<br>
<br>"(3) malign actors seek to conceal their ownership of corporations, limited liability companies, or other similar entities in the United States to facilitate illicit activity, including money laundering, the financing of terrorism, proliferation financing, serious tax fraud, human and drug trafficking, counterfeiting, piracy, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of foreign corruption, harming the national security interests of the United States and allies of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(4) money launderers and others involved in commercial activity intentionally conduct transactions through corporate structures in order to evade detection, and may layer such structures, much like Russian nesting 'Matryoshka' dolls, across various secretive jurisdictions such that each time an investigator obtains ownership records for a domestic or foreign entity, the newly identified entity is yet another corporate entity, necessitating a repeat of the same process;
<br>
<br>"(5) Federal legislation providing for the collection of beneficial ownership information for corporations, limited liability companies, or other similar entities formed under the laws of the States is needed to—
<br>
<br>"(A) set a clear, Federal standard for incorporation practices;

<br>"(B) protect vital Unites States national security interests;
<br>
<br>"(C) protect interstate and foreign commerce;

<br>
<br>"(E) bring the United States into compliance with international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism standards;
<br>
<br>"(6) beneficial ownership information collected under the amendments made by this title is sensitive information and will be directly available only to authorized government authorities, subject to effective safeguards and controls, to—
<br>
<br>"(A) facilitate important national security, intelligence, and law enforcement activities; and
<br>
<br>"(B) confirm beneficial ownership information provided to financial institutions to facilitate the compliance of the financial institutions with anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and customer due diligence requirements under applicable law;
<br>
<br>"(7) consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) maintain the information described in paragraph (1) in a secure, nonpublic database, using information security methods and techniques that are appropriate to protect nonclassified information systems at the highest security level; and
<br>
<br>"(B) take all steps, including regular auditing, to ensure that government authorities accessing beneficial ownership information do so only for authorized purposes consistent with this title; and
<br>
<br>"(8) in prescribing regulations to provide for the reporting of beneficial ownership information, the Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this title—
<br>
<br>"(A) seek to minimize burdens on reporting companies associated with the collection of beneficial ownership information;
<br>
<br>"(B) provide clarity to reporting companies concerning the identification of their beneficial owners; and

<br>
<br>(a) Findings and Purpose.—
<br>
<br>(1) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes frequently appear to be concentrated in particular geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or financial institutions.
<br>
<br>(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.
<br>
<br>(2) Purpose and objective.—It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that—
<br>
<br>(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity; or
<br>
<br>(B) such area can be targeted for law enforcement action.
<br>
<br>(b) Element of National Strategy.—The designation of certain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an element of the national strategy developed pursuant to section 5341(b).
<br>
<br>(c) Designation of Areas.—
<br>
<br>(1) Designation by secretary.—The Secretary, after taking into consideration the factors specified in subsection (d), shall designate any geographical area, industry, sector, or institution in the United States in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk as a "high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area".
<br>
<br>(2) Case-by-case determination in consultation with the attorney general.—In addition to the factors specified in subsection (d), any designation of any area under paragraph (1) shall be made on the basis of a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the particular area, industry, sector, or institution is being victimized by, or is particularly vulnerable to, money laundering and related financial crimes.
<br>
<br>(3) Specific initiatives.—Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit—
<br>
<br>(A) a written request for the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area; or
<br>
<br>(B) a written request for funding under section 5351 for a specific prevention or enforcement initiative, or to determine the extent of financial criminal activity, in an area.
<br>
<br>(d) Factors.—In considering the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area, the Secretary shall, to the extent appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, take into account the following factors:
<br>
<br>(1) The population of the area.
<br>
<br>(2) The number of bank and nonbank financial institution transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.
<br>
<br>(3) The number of stock or commodities transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.
<br>
<br>(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.
<br>
<br>(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.
<br>
<br>(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country.
<br>
<br>(7) The number or nature of requests for information or analytical assistance which—
<br>
<br>(A) are made to the analytical component of the Department of the Treasury; and
<br>
<br>(B) originate from law enforcement or regulatory authorities located in such area or involve institutions or businesses located in such area or residents of such area.
<br>
<br>(8) The volume or nature of suspicious activity reports originating in the area.
<br>
<br>(9) The volume or nature of currency transaction reports or reports of cross-border movements of currency or monetary instruments originating in, or transported through, the area.
<br>
<br>(10) Whether, and how often, the area has been the subject of a geographical targeting order.
<br>
<br>(11) Observed changes in trends and patterns of money laundering activity.
<br>
<br>(12) Unusual patterns, anomalies, growth, or other changes in the volume or nature of core economic statistics or indicators.
<br>
<br>(13) Statistics or indicators of unusual or unexplained volumes of cash transactions.
<br>
<br>(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the volume or nature of transactions conducted through financial institutions operating within or outside the United States.
<br>
<br>(15) The extent to which State and local governments and State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources reflects a determination by such government and agencies to address the problem aggressively.
<br>
<br>(16) The extent to which a significant increase in the allocation of Federal resources to combat financial crimes in such area is necessary to provide an adequate State and local response to financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area.

<br>SUBCHAPTER IV—PROHIBITION ON FUNDING OF UNLAWFUL INTERNET GAMBLING
<br>§5361. Congressional findings and purpose
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire transfers.
<br>
<br>(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which represent such sites.
<br>
<br>(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt collection problems for insured depository institutions and the consumer credit industry.
<br>
<br>(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling prohibitions or regulations on the Internet, especially where such gambling crosses State or national borders.
<br>
<br>(b) Rule of Construction.—No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.
