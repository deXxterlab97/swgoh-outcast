<br>That boast themselves of things of nought;
<br>Bow down to Him, all ye gods.
<br>8Zion heard and was glad,
<br>And the daughters of Judah rejoiced;
<br>Because of Thy judgments, O LORD.
<br>9For Thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth;
<br>Thou art exalted far above all gods.
<br>
<br>10O ye that love the LORD, hate evil;
<br>He preserveth the souls of His saints;
<br> 
<br>He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked.
<br>11Light is sown for the righteous,
<br>And gladness for the upright in heart.
<br>12Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; And give thanks to His holy name.
<br>98 A Psalm.
<br>O sing unto the LORD a new song;
<br>For He hath done marvellous things; His right hand, and His holy arm,
<br>hath wrought salvation for Him.
<br>2The LORD hath made known His salvation;
<br>His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations.
<br>3He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel;
<br>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
<br>
<br>4Shout unto the LORD, all the earth; Break forth and sing for joy, yea,
<br>sing praises.
<br>5Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp;
<br>With the harp and the voice of melody.
<br>6With trumpets and sound of the horn
<br>Shout ye before the King, the LORD.
<br>
<br>7Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
<br>The world, and they that dwell therein;
<br> 
<br>8Let the floods clap their hands;
<br>Let the mountains sing for joy together;
<br>9Before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth;
<br>He will judge the world with righteousness,
<br>And the peoples with equity.
<br>
<br>The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble;
<br>He is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake.
<br>2The LORD is great in Zion;
<br>And He is high above all the peoples.
<br>3Let them praise Thy name as great and awful;
<br>Holy is He.
<br>
<br>4The strength also of the king who loveth justice—
<br>Thou hast established equity,
<br>Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
<br>5Exalt ye the LORD our God,
<br>And prostrate yourselves at His footstool;
<br>Holy is He.
<br>
<br>6Moses and Aaron among His priests,
<br>And Samuel among them that call upon His name,
<br>Did call upon the LORD, and He answered them.
<br>7He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud;
<br> 
<br>They kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them.
<br>8O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them;
<br>A forgiving God wast Thou unto them,
<br>Though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds.
<br>9Exalt ye the LORD our God, And worship at His holy hill; For the LORD our God is holy.
<br> 
<br>2I will give heed unto the way of integrity;
<br>Oh when wilt Thou come unto me?
<br>I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
<br>
<br>3I will set no base thing before mine eyes;
<br>I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me.
<br>4A perverse heart shall depart from me;
<br> 
<br>100
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of thanksgiving.
<br> 
<br>I will know no evil thing.
<br> 
<br>Shout unto the LORD, all the earth.
<br>2Serve the LORD with gladness;
<br>Come before His presence with singing.
<br>3Know ye that the LORD He is God;
<br>It is He that hath made us, and we are His,
<br>His people, and the flock of His pasture.
<br>4Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,
<br>And into His courts with praise;
<br>Give thanks unto Him, and bless His name.
<br>5For the LORD is good; His mercy endureth for ever;
<br>And His faithfulness unto all generations.
<br> 
<br>5Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy;
<br>Whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer.
<br>6Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me;
<br>He that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me.
<br>
<br>7He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house;
<br>He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
<br>8Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
<br>To cut off all the workers of iniquity
<br>from the city of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>101
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of David.
<br>

<br> 
<br>
<br>A Prayer of the afflicted,
<br> 
<br>I will sing of mercy and justice;
<br>Unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing praises.
<br> 
<br>when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.
<br> 
<br>2O LORD, hear my prayer,
<br>And let my cry come unto Thee.
<br>3Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress;
<br>Incline Thine ear unto me;
<br>In the day when I call answer me speedily.
<br>
<br>4For my days are consumed like smoke,
<br>And my bones are burned as a hearth.
<br>5My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
<br>For I forget to eat my bread.
<br>6By reason of the voice of my sighing
<br>My bones cleave to my flesh.
<br>7I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
<br>I am become as an owl of the waste places.
<br>8I watch, and am become
<br>Like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.
<br>9Mine enemies taunt me all the day;
<br>They that are mad against me do curse by me.
<br>10For I have eaten ashes like bread,
<br>And mingled my drink with weeping,
<br>11Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath;
<br>For Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
<br>12My days are like a lengthening shadow;
<br>And I am withered like grass.
<br> 
<br>13But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever;
<br>And Thy name is unto all generations.
<br>14Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion;
<br>For it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.
<br>15For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
<br>And love her dust.
<br>16So the nations will fear the name of the LORD,
<br>And all the kings of the earth Thy glory;
<br>17When the LORD hath built up Zion,
<br>When He hath appeared in His glory;
<br>18When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute,
<br>And hath not despised their prayer.
<br>
<br>19This shall be written for the generation to come;
<br>And a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
<br>20For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary;
<br>From heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
<br>21To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
<br>To loose those that are appointed to death;
<br>22That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion,
<br>And His praise in Jerusalem;
<br> 
<br>23When the peoples are gathered together,
<br>And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
<br>
<br>24He weakened my strength in the way;
<br>He shortened my days.
<br>25I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days,
<br>Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.
<br>26Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth;
<br>And the heavens are the work of Thy hands.
<br>27They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
<br>Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
<br>As a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;
<br>28But Thou art the selfsame,
<br>And Thy years shall have no end.
<br>29The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely,
<br>And their seed shall be established before Thee.'
<br> 
<br>4Who redeemeth Thy life from the pit;
<br>Who encompasseth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
<br>5Who satisfieth thine old age with good things;
<br>So that Thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
<br>
<br>6The LORD executeth righteousness,
<br>And acts of justice for all that are oppressed.
<br>7He made known His ways unto Moses,
<br>His doings unto the children of Israel.
<br>8The LORD is full of compassion and gracious,
<br>Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
<br>9He will not always contend;
<br>Neither will He keep His anger for ever.
<br>10He hath not dealt with us after our sins,
<br>Nor requited us according to our iniquities.
<br>11For as the heaven is high above the
<br> 
<br>103
<br> 
<br>[A Psalm] of David.
<br> 
<br>earth,
<br>So great is His mercy toward them
<br> 
<br>Bless the LORD, O my soul;
<br>And all that is within me, bless His holy name.
<br>2Bless the LORD, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits;
<br>3Who forgiveth all thine iniquity; Who healeth all Thy diseases;
<br> 
<br>that fear Him.
<br>12As far as the east is from the west,
<br>So far hath He removed our transgressions from us.
<br>13Like as a father hath compassion upon his children,
<br>So hath the LORD compassion upon them that fear Him.
<br> 
<br>14For He knoweth our frame;
<br>He remembereth that we are dust.
<br>15As for man, his days are as grass;
<br>As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
<br>16For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
<br>And the place thereof knoweth it no more.
<br>17But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him,
<br>And His righteousness unto children's children;
<br>18To such as keep His covenant,
<br>And to those that remember His precepts to do them.
<br>
<br>19The LORD hath established His throne in the heavens;
<br>And His kingdom ruleth over all.
<br>20Bless the LORD, ye angels of His,
<br>Ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word,
<br>Hearkening unto the voice of His word.
<br>21Bless the LORD, all ye His hosts;
<br>Ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure.
<br>22Bless the LORD, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion; Bless the LORD, O my soul.
<br> 
<br>2Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment,
<br>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
<br>3Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters,
<br>Who makest the clouds Thy chariot,
<br>Who walkest upon the wings of the wind;
<br>4Who makest winds Thy messengers,
<br>The flaming fire Thy ministers.
<br>
<br>5Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations,
<br>That it should not be moved for ever and ever;
<br>6Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture;
<br>The waters stood above the mountains.
<br>7At Thy rebuke they fled,
<br>At the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away—
<br>8The mountains rose, the valleys sank down—
<br>Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them;
<br>9Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over,
<br>That they might not return to cover the earth.
<br> 
<br>104
<br> 
<br>
<br>Bless the LORD, O my soul.
<br> 
<br>
<br>10Who sendest forth springs into the valleys;
<br> 
<br>O LORD my God, Thou art very great;
<br>Thou art clothed with glory and majesty.
<br> 
<br>They run between the mountains;
<br>11They give drink to every beast of the field,
<br>The wild asses quench their thirst.
<br> 
<br>12Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven,
<br>From among the branches they sing.
<br>13Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers;
<br>The earth is full of the fruit of Thy works.
<br>
<br>14Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle,
<br>And herb for the service of man;
<br>To bring forth bread out of the earth,
<br>15And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
<br>Making the face brighter than oil, And bread that stayeth man's heart. 16The trees of the LORD have their
<br>fill,
<br>The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;
<br>17Wherein the birds make their nests;
<br>As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
<br>18The high mountains are for the wild goats;
<br>The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
<br>
<br>19Who appointedst the moon for seasons;
<br>The sun knoweth his going down.
<br>20Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
<br>Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
<br>21The young lions roar after their prey,
<br>And seek their food from God.
<br> 
<br>22The sun ariseth, they slink away, And couch in their dens.
<br>23Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labour until the evening.
<br>
<br>24How manifold are Thy works, O LORD!
<br>In wisdom hast Thou made them all; The earth is full of Thy creatures.
<br>25Yonder sea, great and wide,
<br>Therein are creeping things innumerable,
<br>Living creatures, both small and great.
<br>26There go the ships;
<br>There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein.
<br>27All of them wait for Thee,
<br>That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.
<br>28Thou givest it unto them, they gather it;
<br>Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
<br>29Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish;
<br>Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish,
<br>And return to their dust.
<br>30Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created;
<br>And Thou renewest the face of the earth.
<br>
<br>31May the glory of the LORD endure for ever;
<br>Let the LORD rejoice in His works!
<br>32Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
<br> 
<br>He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
<br>33I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live;
<br>I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
<br>34Let my musing be sweet unto Him;
<br>As for me, I will rejoice in the LORD. 35Let sinners cease out of the earth, And let the wicked be no more.
<br>Bless the LORD, O my soul.
<br>aHallelujah.
<br> 
<br>His judgments are in all the earth.
<br>8He hath remembered His covenant for ever,
<br>The word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
<br>9[The covenant] which He made with Abraham,
<br>And His oath unto Isaac;
<br>10And He established it unto Jacob for a statute,
<br>To Israel for an everlasting covenant;
<br>11Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
<br> 
<br>105
<br> 
<br>O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name;
<br> 
<br>The lot of your inheritance.'
<br>
<br>12When they were but a few men in
<br> 
<br>Make known His doings among the peoples.
<br>2Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him;
<br>Speak ye of all His marvellous works.
<br>3Glory ye in His holy name;
<br>Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
<br>4Seek ye the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
<br>5Remember His marvellous works that He hath done,
<br>His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;
<br>6O ye seed of Abraham His servant,
<br>Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
<br>
<br>7He is the LORD our God;
<br>
<br>a That is, Praise ye the LORD.
<br> 
<br>number.
<br>Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,
<br>13And when they went about from nation to nation,
<br>From one kingdom to another people,
<br>14He suffered no man to do them wrong,
<br>Yea, for their sake He reproved kings:
<br>15'Touch not Mine anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.'
<br>
<br>16And He called a famine upon the land;
<br>He broke the whole staff of bread. 17He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant; 18His feet they hurt with fetters, His person was laid in iron;
<br>19Until the time that his word came to pass,
<br> 
<br>The word of the LORD tested him.
<br>20The king sent and loosed him;
<br>Even the ruler of the peoples, and set him free.
<br>21He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his possessions; 22To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.
<br>
<br>23Israel also came into Egypt;
<br>And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
<br>24And He increased His people greatly,
<br>And made them too mighty for their adversaries.
<br>25He turned their heart to hate His people,
<br>To deal craftily with His servants.
<br>26He sent Moses His servant,
<br>And Aaron whom He had chosen.
<br>27They wrought among them His manifold signs,
<br>And wonders in the land of Ham.
<br>28He sent darkness, and it was dark;
<br>And they rebelled not against His word.
<br>29He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.
<br>30Their land swarmed with frogs, In the chambers of their kings.
<br>31He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
<br>And gnats in all their borders. 32He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.
<br>33He smote their vines also and their fig-trees;
<br>And broke the trees of their borders.
<br> 
<br>34He spoke, and the locust came,
<br>And the canker-worm without number,
<br>35And did eat up every herb in their land,
<br>And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
<br>36He smote also all the first-born in their land,
<br>The first-fruits of all their strength.
<br>37And He brought them forth with silver and gold;
<br>And there was none that stumbled among His tribes.
<br>38Egypt was glad when they departed;
<br>For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
<br>
<br>39He spread a cloud for a screen; And fire to give light in the night. 40They asked, and He brought
<br>quails,
<br>And gave them in plenty the bread of heaven.
<br>41He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
<br>They ran, a river in the dry places. 42For He remembered His holy word Unto Abraham His servant;
<br>43And He brought forth His people with joy,
<br>His chosen ones with singing.
<br>44And He gave them the lands of the nations,
<br>And they took the labour of the peoples in possession;
<br>45That they might keep His statutes, And observe His laws.
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>10And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
<br> 
<br>106
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good;
<br> 
<br>And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
<br>11And the waters covered their
<br> 
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2Who can express the mighty acts of the LORD,
<br>Or make all His praise to be heard? 3Happy are they that keep justice, That do righteousness at all times. 4Remember me, O LORD, when Thou
<br>favourest Thy people;
<br>O think of me at Thy salvation;
<br>5That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen,
<br>That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation,
<br>That I may glory with Thine inheritance.
<br>
<br>6We have sinned with our fathers,
<br>We have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.
<br>7Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders;
<br>They remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies;
<br>But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
<br>8Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,
<br>That He might make His mighty power to be known.
<br>9And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up;
<br>And He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
<br> 
<br>adversaries;
<br>There was not one of them left. 12Then believed they His words; They sang His praise.
<br>
<br>13They soon forgot His works; They waited not for His counsel; 14But lusted exceedingly in the
<br>wilderness,
<br>And tried God in the desert. 15And He gave them their request; But sent leanness into their soul.
<br>
<br>16They were jealous also of Moses in the camp,
<br>And of Aaron the holy one of the LORD.
<br>17The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
<br>And covered the company of Abiram.
<br>18And a fire was kindled in their company;
<br>The flame burned up the wicked.
<br>
<br>19They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.
<br>20Thus they exchanged their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth
<br>grass.
<br>21They forgot God their saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt; 22Wondrous works in the land of
<br>Ham,
<br> 
<br>Terrible things by the Red Sea.
<br>23Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
<br>Had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach,
<br>To turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.
<br>
<br>24Moreover, they scorned the desirable land,
<br>They believed not His word;
<br>25And they murmured in their tents,
<br>They hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
<br>26Therefore He swore concerning them,
<br>That He would overthrow them in the wilderness;
<br>27And that He would cast out their seed among the nations,
<br>And scatter them in the lands.
<br>
<br>28They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor,
<br>And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
<br>29Thus they provoked Him with their doings,
<br>And the plague broke in upon them.
<br>30Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment,
<br>And so the plague was stayed.
<br>31And that was counted unto him for righteousness,
<br>Unto all generations for ever.
<br>
<br>32They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah,
<br>And it went ill with Moses because of them;
<br> 
<br>33For they embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lips.
<br>
<br>34They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them; 35But mingled themselves with the
<br>nations,
<br>And learned their works;
<br>36And they served their idols, Which became a snare unto them; 37Yea, they sacrificed their sons and
<br>their daughters unto demons,
<br>38And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
<br>Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
<br>And the land was polluted with blood.
<br>39Thus were they defiled with their works,
<br>And went astray in their doings.
<br>40Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people,
<br>And He abhorred His inheritance.
<br>41And He gave them into the hand of the nations;
<br>And they that hated them ruled over them.
<br>42Their enemies also oppressed them,
<br>And they were subdued under their hand.
<br>43Many times did He deliver them;
<br>But they were rebellious in their counsel,
<br>And sank low through their iniquity.
<br>44Nevertheless He looked upon their distress,
<br> 
<br>When He heard their cry;
<br>45And He remembered for them His covenant,
<br>And repented according to the multitude of His mercies.
<br>46He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them
<br>captive.
<br>
<br>47Save us, O LORD our God,
<br>And gather us from among the nations,
<br>That we may give thanks unto Thy holy name,
<br>That we may triumph in Thy praise.
<br>
<br>48Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
<br>From everlasting even to everlasting,
<br>And let all the people say: 'Amen.' Hallelujah.

<br>4They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
<br>They found no city of habitation.
<br>5Hungry and thirsty,
<br>Their soul fainted in them.
<br>6Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
<br>And He delivered them out of their distresses.
<br>7And He led them by a straight way,
<br>That they might go to a city of habitation.
<br>8Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy,
<br>And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>9For He hath satisfied the longing soul,
<br>And the hungry soul He hath filled with good.
<br>
<br>10Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
<br>Being bound in affliction and iron—
<br>11Because they rebelled against the words of God,
<br>And contemned the counsel of the Most High.
<br>12Therefore He humbled their heart
<br> 
<br>107
<br> 
<br>
<br>LORD, for He is good,
<br> 
<br>with travail,
<br> 
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.'
<br>2So let the redeemed of the LORD say,
<br>Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;
<br>3And gathered them out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the sea.
<br> 
<br>They stumbled, and there was none to help—
<br>13They cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
<br>And He saved them out of their distresses.
<br>14He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
<br>And broke their bands in sunder.
<br> 
<br>15Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy,
<br>And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>16For He hath broken the gates of brass,
<br>And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
<br>
<br>17Crazed because of the way of their transgression,
<br>And afflicted because of their iniquities—
<br>18Their soul abhorred all manner of food,
<br>And they drew near unto the gates of death—
<br>19They cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
<br>And He saved them out of their distresses;
<br>20He sent His word, and healed them,
<br>And delivered them from their graves.
<br>21Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy,
<br>And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>22And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
<br>And declare His works with singing.
<br>
<br>23They that go down to the sea in ships,
<br>That do business in great waters— 24These saw the works of the LORD, And His wonders in the deep;
<br>25For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind,
<br> 
<br>Which lifted up the waves thereof; 26They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps;
<br>Their soul melted away because of trouble;
<br>27They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man,
<br>And all their wisdom was swallowed up—
<br>28They cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
<br>And He brought them out of their distresses.
<br>29He made the storm a calm,
<br>So that the waves thereof were still.
<br>30Then were they glad because they were quiet,
<br>And He led them unto their desired haven.
<br>31Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy,
<br>And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>32Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,
<br>And praise Him in the seat of the elders.
<br>33He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
<br>And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
<br>34A fruitful land into a salt waste,
<br>For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
<br>
<br>35He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
<br>And a dry land into watersprings.
<br>36And there He maketh the hungry to dwell,
<br> 
<br>And they establish a city of habitation;
<br>37And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
<br>Which yield fruits of increase.
<br>38He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly,
<br>And suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
<br>
<br>39Again, they are minished and dwindle away
<br>Through oppression of evil and sorrow.
<br>40He poureth contempt upon princes,
<br>And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
<br>41Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction,
<br>And maketh his families like a flock.
<br>42The upright see it, and are glad; And all iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
<br>
<br>43Whoso is wise, let him observe these things,
<br>And let them consider the mercies of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>And I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
<br>5For Thy mercy is great above the heavens,
<br>And Thy truth reacheth unto the skies.
<br>6Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
<br>And Thy glory be above all the earth.
<br>7That Thy beloved may be delivered,
<br>Save with Thy right hand, and answer me.
<br>
<br>8God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult;
<br>That I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
<br>9Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;
<br>Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
<br>Judah is my sceptre.
<br>10Moab is my washpot;
<br>Upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Over Philistia do I cry aloud. 11Who will bring me into the
<br>fortified city?
<br>Who will lead me unto Edom?
<br> 
<br>108
<br> 
<br>A Song, a Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>12Hast not Thou cast us off, O God? And Thou goest not forth, O God,
<br> 
<br>2My heart is steadfast, O God;
<br>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
<br>3Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.
<br>4I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the peoples;
<br> 
<br>with our hosts?
<br>13Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
<br>14Through God we shall do valiantly;
<br>For He it is that will tread down our adversaries.
<br> 
<br>109
<br> 
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>12Let there be none to extend kindness unto him;
<br>Neither let there be any to be
<br> 
<br>O God of my praise, keep not silence;
<br>2For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me;
<br>They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
<br>3They compassed me about also with words of hatred,
<br>And fought against me without a cause.
<br>4In return for my love they are my adversaries;
<br>But I am all prayer.
<br>5And they have laid upon me evil for good,
<br>And hatred for my love:
<br>
<br>6’Set Thou a wicked man over him;
<br>And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
<br>7When he is judged, let him go forth condemned;
<br>And let his prayer be turned into sin.
<br>8Let his days be few;
<br>Let another take his charge. 9Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.
<br>10Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;
<br>And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
<br>11Let the creditor distrain all that he hath;
<br>And let strangers make spoil of his labour.
<br> 
<br>gracious unto his fatherless children.
<br>13Let his posterity be cut off;
<br>In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
<br>14Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto the LORD;
<br>And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
<br>15Let them be before the LORD continually,
<br>That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
<br>16Because that he remembered not to do kindness,
<br>But persecuted the poor and needy man,
<br>And the broken in heart he was ready to slay.
<br>17Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;
<br>And he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him.
<br>18He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment,
<br>And it is come into his inward parts like water,
<br>And like oil into his bones.
<br>19Let it be unto him as the garment which he putteth on,
<br>And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.'
<br>
<br>20This would mine adversaries effect from the LORD,
<br> 
<br>And they that speak evil against my soul.
<br>21But Thou, O GOD the Lord, deal
<br> 
<br>To save him from them that judge his soul.
<br> 
<br>with me for Thy name's sake; Because Thy mercy is good, deliver
<br> 
<br>110
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>Thou me.
<br>22For I am poor and needy,
<br>And my heart is wounded within me.
<br>23I am gone like the shadow when it lengtheneth;
<br>I am shaken off as the locust.
<br>24My knees totter through fasting;
<br>And my flesh is lean, and hath no fatness.
<br>25I am become also a taunt unto them;
<br>When they see me, they shake their head.
<br>
<br>26Help me, O LORD my God;
<br>O save me according to Thy mercy;
<br>27That they may know that this is Thy hand;
<br>That Thou, LORD, hast done it.
<br>28Let them curse, but bless Thou;
<br>When they arise, they shall be put to shame, but Thy servant shall rejoice.
<br>29Mine adversaries shall be clothed with confusion,
<br>And shall put on their own shame as a robe.
<br>30I will give great thanks unto the
<br>LORD with my mouth;
<br> 
<br>The LORD saith unto my lord: ‘Sit thou at My right hand,
<br>Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.'
<br>2The rod of Thy strength the LORD will send out of Zion:
<br>'Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.'
<br>3Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy warfare;
<br>In adornments of holiness, from the womb of the dawn,
<br>Thine is the dew of thy youth.
<br>
<br>4The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent:
<br>'Thou art a priest for ever
<br>After the manner of Melchizedek.'
<br>5The Lord at thy right hand
<br>Doth crush kings in the day of His wrath.
<br>6He will judge among the nations; He filleth it with the dead bodies,
<br>He crusheth the head over a wide land.
<br>7He will drink of the brook in the way;
<br>Therefore will he lift up the head.
<br> 
<br>Yea, I will praise Him among the multitude;
<br> 
<br>111
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>31Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy,
<br> 
<br>א I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart,
<br> 
<br>ב In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
<br> 
<br>112
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>ג 2The works of the LORD are great, ד Sought out of all them that have
<br>delight therein.
<br>ה 3His work is glory and majesty;
<br>ו And His righteousness endureth for ever.
<br>ז 4He hath made a memorial for His wonderful works;
<br>ח The LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
<br>ט 5He hath given food unto them that fear Him;
<br>י He will ever be mindful of His covenant.
<br>כ 6He hath declared to His people the power of His works,
<br>ל In giving them the heritage of the nations.
<br>מ 7The works of His hands are truth and justice;
<br>נ All His precepts are sure.
<br>ס 8They are established for ever and ever,
<br>ע They are done in truth and uprightness.
<br>פ 9He hath sent redemption unto His people;
<br>צ He hath commanded His covenant for ever;
<br>ק Holy and awful is His name. ר 10The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom;
<br>ש A good understanding have all they that do thereafter;
<br>ת His praise endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>א Happy is the man that feareth the LORD,
<br>ב That delighteth greatly in His commandments.
<br>ג 2His seed shall be mighty upon earth;
<br>ד The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
<br>ה 3Wealth and riches are in his house; ו And his merit endureth for ever.
<br>ז 4Unto the upright He shineth as a light in the darkness,
<br>ח Gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
<br>ט 5Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth,
<br>י That ordereth his affairs rightfully. כ 6For he shall never be moved;
<br>ל The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
<br>מ 7He shall not be afraid of evil tidings;
<br>נ His heart is stedfast, trusting in the LORD.
<br>ס 8His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
<br>ע Until he gaze upon his adversaries. פ 9He hath scattered abroad, he hath
<br>given to the needy;
<br>צ His righteousness endureth for ever; ק His horn shall be exalted in honour. ר 10The wicked shall see it, and be
<br>vexed;
<br>ש He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away;
<br>ת The desire of the wicked shall perish.
<br> 
<br>113
<br> 
<br>
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>Praise, O ye servants of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>The hills like young sheep.
<br>
<br>5What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?
<br> 
<br>Praise the name of the LORD. 2Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth and for ever. 3From the rising of the sun unto the
<br>going down thereof
<br>The LORD'S name is to be praised.
<br>
<br>4The LORD is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens.
<br>5Who is like unto the LORD our God, That is enthroned on high,
<br>6That looketh down low
<br> 
<br>Thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward?
<br>6Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;
<br>Ye hills, like young sheep?
<br>7Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,
<br>At the presence of the God of Jacob;
<br>8Who turned the rock into a pool of water,
<br>The flint into a fountain of waters.
<br> 
<br>Upon heaven and upon the earth?
<br> 
<br>115
<br> 
<br>Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us,
<br> 
<br>7Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
<br>And lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill;
<br>8That He may set him with princes, Even with the princes of His people. 9Who maketh the barren woman to
<br>dwell in her house
<br>As a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>But unto Thy name give glory,
<br>For Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake.
<br>2Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is now their God?'
<br>
<br>3But our God is in the heavens;
<br>Whatsoever pleased Him He hath done.
<br>4Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
<br> 
<br>114
<br> 
<br>When Israel came forth out of Egypt,
<br> 
<br>5They have mouths, but they speak not;
<br> 
<br>The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
<br>2Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.
<br>
<br>3The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan turned backward.
<br>4The mountains skipped like rams,
<br> 
<br>Eyes have they, but they see not; 6They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not; 7They have hands, but they handle
<br>not;
<br>Feet have they, but they walk not; Neither speak they with their throat.
<br> 
<br>8They that make them shall be like unto them;
<br>Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
<br>
<br>9O Israel, trust thou in the LORD! He is their help and their shield! 10O house of Aaron, trust ye in the
<br>LORD!
<br>He is their help and their shield!
<br>11Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD!
<br>He is their help and their shield.
<br>
<br>12The LORD hath been mindful of us, He will bless—
<br>He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron. 13He will bless them that fear the
<br>LORD,
<br>Both small and great.
<br>14The LORD increase you more and more,
<br>You and your children. 15Blessed be ye of the LORD Who made heaven and earth.
<br>
<br>16The heavens are the heavens of the LORD;
<br>But the earth hath He given to the children of men.
<br>17The dead praise not the LORD,
<br>Neither any that go down into silence;
<br>18But we will bless the LORD From this time forth and for ever. Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>Mmy voice and my supplications.
<br>2Because He hath inclined His ear unto me,
<br>Therefore will I call upon Him all my days.
<br>
<br>3The cords of death compassed me,
<br>And the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me;
<br>I found trouble and sorrow.
<br>4But I called upon the name of the LORD:
<br>'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my soul.'
<br>5Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
<br>Yea, our God is compassionate.
<br>6The LORD preserveth the simple;
<br>I was brought low, and He saved me.
<br>
<br>7Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest;
<br>For the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
<br>8For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
<br>Mine eyes from tears,
<br>And my feet from stumbling. 9I shall walk before the LORD In the lands of the living.
<br>10I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.'
<br>11I said in my haste:
<br>'All men are liars.'
<br>
<br>12How can I repay unto the LORD All His bountiful dealings toward
<br> 
<br>116
<br> 
<br>I love that the LORD should hear
<br> 
<br>me?
<br>13I will lift up the cup of salvation,
<br> 
<br>And call upon the name of the LORD.
<br>14My vows will I pay unto the LORD,
<br>Yea, in the presence of all His people.
<br>
<br>15Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His saints.
<br>16I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am Thy servant;
<br>I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid;
<br>Thou hast loosed my bands.
<br>17I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
<br>And will call upon the name of the LORD.
<br>18I will pay my vows unto the LORD,
<br>Yea, in the presence of all His people;
<br>19In the courts of the LORD’S house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>4So let them now that fear the LORD say,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>5Out of my straits I called upon the LORD;
<br>He answered me with great enlargement.
<br>6The LORD is for me; I will not fear; What can man do unto me?
<br>7The LORD is for me as my helper;
<br>And I shall gaze upon them that hate me.
<br>8It is better to take refuge in the LORD
<br>Than to trust in man.
<br>9It is better to take refuge in the LORD
<br>Than to trust in princes.
<br>10All nations compass me about;
<br>Verily, in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.
<br>11They compass me about, yea, they
<br> 
<br>117
<br> 
<br>O praise the LORD, all ye nations;
<br> 
<br>compass me about;
<br>Verily, in the name of the LORD I
<br> 
<br>Laud Him, all ye peoples.
<br>2For His mercy is great toward us;
<br>And the truth of the LORD endureth for ever.
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>will cut them off.
<br>12They compass me about like bees;
<br>They are quenched as the fire of thorns;
<br>Verily, in the name of the LORD I
<br>will cut them off.
<br> 
<br>118
<br> 
<br>'O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good,
<br> 
<br>13Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall;
<br> 
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2So let Israel now say,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever, 3So let the house of Aaron now say, For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>But the LORD helped me.
<br>14The LORD is my strength and song; And He is become my salvation.
<br>15The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous;
<br> 
<br>The right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
