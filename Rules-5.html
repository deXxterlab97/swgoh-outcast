<br>9And on the sabbath day two he- lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink- offering thereof. 10This is the burnt- offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
<br>11And in your new moons ye shall present a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; 12and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; 13and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 14And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the
<br> 
<br>months of the year. 15And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
<br>16And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the LORD’S passover. 17And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. 18In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work; 19but ye shall present an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish; 20and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram; 21a several tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs; 22and one he- goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you. 23Ye shall offer these beside the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering. 24After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt- offering, and the drink-offering thereof. 25And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<br>26Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye bring a new meal-offering
<br> 
<br>unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no manner of servile work; 27but ye shall present a burnt-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he- lambs of the first year; 28and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram, 29a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs; 30one he-goat, to make atonement for you. 31Beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal- offering thereof, ye shall offer them— they shall be unto you without blemish—and their drink-offerings.
<br>And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
<br>shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a day of blowing the horn unto you. 2And ye shall prepare a burnt-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD: one young bullock, one ram, seven he- lambs of the first year without blemish; 3and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth part for the ram, 4and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs; 5and one he- goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you; 6beside the burnt- offering of the new moon, and the meal-offering thereof, and the continual burnt-offering and the meal- offering thereof, and their drink- offerings,     according     unto     their
<br> 
<br>ordinance, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>7And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls; ye shall do no manner of work; 8but ye shall present a burnt-offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour: one young bullock, one ram, seven he- lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish; 9and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram, 10a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs; 11one he-goat for a sin- offering; beside the sin-offering of atonement, and the continual burnt- offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings.

<br> 
<br>offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.
<br>17And on the second day ye shall present twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish; 18and their meal- offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance; 19and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings.
<br>20And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish; 21and their meal-offering and their drink- offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance; 22and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.

<br>26And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish; 27and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings
<br> 
<br>for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance; 28and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. 29And	on	the	sixth	day	eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish; 30and their meal-offering and their drink- offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance; 31and one he-goat for a sin-offering; beside the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-

<br>And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
<br>the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>מטות
<br>2And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying:
<br>This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded. 3When a man voweth a vow unto the LORD, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. 4Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth, 5and her father heareth her vow, or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 6But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father
<br> 
<br>disallowed her. 7And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; 8and her husband hear it, whatsoever day it be that he heareth it, and hold his peace at her; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 9But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; and the LORD will forgive her. 10But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her. 11 And if a woman vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 12and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 13But if her husband make them null and void in the day that he heareth them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips, whether it were her vows, or the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD will forgive her. 14Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void. 15But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he causeth all her vows to stand, or all her bonds, which are upon her; he hath
<br> 
<br>let them stand, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 16But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. 17These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses, saying:   2’Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites; afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.’ 3And Moses spoke unto the people, saying: ‘Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the LORD’S vengeance on Midian. 4Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.’ 5So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.	6And	Moses	sent	them,	a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. 7And they warred against Midian,   as   the   LORD     commanded Moses; and they slew every male. 8And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian; Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 9And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their
<br> 
<br>little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 10And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 11And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast. 12And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp, unto the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
<br>13And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 14And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. 15And Moses said unto them: ‘Have ye saved all the women alive? 16Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to revolt so as to break faith with the LORD in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD. 17Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. 18But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 19And encamp ye without the camp seven days; whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the
<br> 
<br>third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives. 20And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify.’
<br>21And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: ‘This is the statute of the law which the LORD hath commanded Moses: 22Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 23every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling; and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water. 24And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye may come into the camp.’
<br>25And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 26’Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the congregation; 27and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation; 28and levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the flocks; 29take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, as a portion set apart for the LORD. 30And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of
<br> 
<br>the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.’ 31And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 32Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 33and threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 34and threescore and one thousand asses, 35and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him. 36And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep. 37And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. 38And the beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and twelve. 39And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and one. 40And the persons were sixteen thousand, of whom the LORD’S tribute was thirty and two persons. 41And Moses gave the tribute, which was set apart for the LORD, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 42And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred— 43now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand
<br> 
<br>and five hundred sheep, 44and thirty and six thousand beeves, 45and thirty thousand and five hundred asses, 46and sixteen thousand persons— 47even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>48And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses; 49and they said unto Moses: ‘Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. 50And we have brought the LORD’S offering, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the LORD.’ 51And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. 52And all the gold of the gift that they set apart for the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.— 53For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.— 54And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
<br> 
<br>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a
<br>very great multitude of cattle; and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle, 2the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying: 3’Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 4the land which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.’ 5And they said: ‘If we have found favour in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.’ 6And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: ‘Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here? 7And wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? 8Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. 9For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they turned away the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 10And the LORD’S anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying: 11Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see
<br> 
<br>the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed Me; 12save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed the LORD. 13And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed. 14And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’stead, a brood of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 15For if ye turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and so ye will destroy all this people.’
<br>16And they came near unto him, and said: ‘We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones; 17but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 18We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 19For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.’
<br>20And Moses said unto them: ‘If ye will do this thing: if ye will arm yourselves to go before the LORD to the
<br> 
<br>war, 21and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the LORD, until He hath driven out His enemies from before Him, 22and the land be subdued before the LORD, and ye return afterward; then ye shall be clear before the LORD, and before Israel, and this land shall be unto you for a possession before the LORD. 23But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD; and know ye your sin which will find you. 24Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.’
<br>25And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 26Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 27but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.’
<br>28So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’houses of the tribes of the children of Israel. 29And Moses said unto them: ‘If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; 30but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions
<br> 
<br>among you in the land of Canaan.’ 31And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: ‘As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. 32We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.’
<br>33And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half- tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with their borders, even the cities of the land round about. 34And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer; 35and Atroth- shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah; 36and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran; fortified cities, and folds for sheep. 37And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim; 38and Nebo, and Baal-meon—their names being changed—and Sibmah; and gave their names unto the cities which they builded. 39And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein. 40And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 41And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the villages thereof, and called them aHavvoth-jair. 42And
<br>
<br>a That is, The villages of Jair.
<br> 
<br>Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
<br>מסעי
<br>These are the stages of the children of Israel, by which
<br>they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron. 2And Moses wrote their goings forth, stage by stage, by the commandment of the LORD; and these are their stages at their goings forth. 3And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, 4while the Egyptians were burying them that the LORD had smitten among them, even all their first-born; upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments. 5And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. 6And they journeyed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness. 7And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon; and they pitched before Migdol. 8And they journeyed from Penehahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days’journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 9And they journeyed from Marah, and came unto Elim; and in Elim were twelve springs of  water,  and threescore  and
<br> 
<br>ten palm-trees; and they pitched there. 10And they journeyed from Elim, and pitched by the Red Sea. 11And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and pitched in the wilderness of Sin. 12And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and pitched in Dophkah. 13And they journeyed from Dophkah, and pitched in Alush. 14And they journeyed from Alush, and pitched in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink. 15And they journeyed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai. 16And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and pitched in Kibroth- hattaavah. 17And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and pitched in Hazeroth. 18And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 19And they journeyed from Rithmah, and pitched in Rimmon-perez. 20And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and pitched in Libnah. 21And they journeyed from Libnah, and pitched in Rissah. 22And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelah. 23And they journeyed from Kehelah, and pitched in mount Shepher. 24And they journeyed from mount Shepher, and pitched in Haradah. 25And they journeyed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. 26And they journeyed from Makheloth, and pitched in Tahath. 27And they journeyed from Tahath, and pitched in Terah. 28And they journeyed from Terah, and pitched in Mithkah. 29And they journeyed from Mithkah, and pitched
<br> 
<br>in Hashmonah. 30And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and pitched in Moseroth. 31And they journeyed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan. 32And they journeyed from Bene- jaakan, and pitched in Hor-haggidgad. 33And they journeyed from Hor- haggidgad, and pitched in Jotbah. 34And they journeyed from Jotbah, and pitched in Abronah. 35And they journeyed from Abronah, and pitched in Ezion-geber. 36And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin—the same is Kadesh. 37And they journeyed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.— 38And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. 39And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. 40And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.— 41And they journeyed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 42And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 43And they journeyed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 44And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab. 45And they journeyed from Ijim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 46And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and
<br> 
<br>pitched in Almon-diblathaim. 47And they journeyed from Almon- diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, in front of Nebo. 48And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 49And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
<br>50And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 51’Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 52then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places. 53And ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it. 54And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families—to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit. 55But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell. 56And it shall come to pass, that
<br> 
<br>as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses,   saying:   2’Command
<br>the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof. 3Thus your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin close by the side of Edom, and your south border shall begin at the end of the Salt Sea eastward; 4and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh- barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar- addar, and pass along to Azmon; 5and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Sea. 6And for the western border, ye shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your west border. 7And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall mark out your line unto mount Hor; 8from mount Hor ye shall mark out a line unto the entrance to Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; 9and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your north border. 10And ye shall mark out your line for the east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham; 11and the border shall go down from Shepham to

<br>Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall strike upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; 12and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.’
<br>13And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: ‘This is the land wherein ye shall receive inheritance by lot, which the LORD hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe; 14for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance; 15the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sun- rising.’
<br>16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 17’These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 18And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to take possession of the land. 19And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 20And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. 21Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 22And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince,
<br> 
<br>Bukki the son of Jogli. 23Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod; 24and of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 25And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Eli-zaphan the son of Parnach. 26And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan. 27And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 28And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. 29These are they whom the LORD   commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.’
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab
<br>by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 2’Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and open land round about the cities shall ye give unto the Levites. 3And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their open land shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts. 4And the open land about the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 5And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side
<br> 
<br>two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the open land about the cities. 6And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither; and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities. 7All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with the open land about them. 8And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many, and from the few ye shall take few; each tribe according to its inheritance which it inheriteth shall give of its cities unto the Levites.’
<br>9And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 10’Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 11then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person through error may flee thither. 12And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment. 13And as to the cities which ye shall give, there shall be for you six cities of refuge. 14Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 15For the children of Israel, and for the stranger
<br> 
<br>and for the settler among them, shall these six cities be for refuge, that every one that killeth any person through error may flee thither. 16But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. 17And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. 18Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. 19The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death. 20And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him any thing, lying in wait, so that he died; 21or in enmity smote him with his hand, that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death: he is a murderer; the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meeteth him. 22But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait, 23or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; 24then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 25and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his
<br> 
<br>city of refuge, whither he was fled; and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. 26But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth; 27and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him; 28because he must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return into the land of his possession. 29And these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 30Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die. 31Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death. 32And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 33So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 34And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD
<br> 
<br>dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.’
<br>
<br>And the heads of the fathers’houses of the family of
<br>the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’houses of the children of Israel; 2and they said: ‘The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 3And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 4And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.’ 5And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: ‘The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. 6This is the
<br> 
<br>thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. 7So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 8And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 9So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.’ 10Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. 11For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’sons. 12They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
<br>13These are the commandments and the ordinances, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

<br>דברים
<br>DEUTERONOMY
<br> 
<br>THESE ARE the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. 2It is eleven days journey from Horeb unto Kadesh- barnea by the way of mount Seir. 3And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that   the   LORD     had given him in commandment unto them; 4after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth,	at		Edrei;		5beyond	the Jordan, in the land of Moab, took Moses upon him to expound this law, saying: 6The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: ‘Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain; 7turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South, and by the	sea-shore;		the	land	of	the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great		river,	the	river	Euphrates. 8Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, to
<br> 
<br>Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.’
<br>9And I spoke unto you at that time, saying: ‘I am not able to bear you myself alone; 10the LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.—11The LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as He hath promised you!— 12How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 13Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over you.’ 14And ye answered me, and said: ‘The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.’ 15So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe. 16And I charged your judges at that time, saying: ‘Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. 17Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not
<br> 
<br>be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.’ 18And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
<br>19And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. 20And I said unto you: ‘Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God giveth unto us. 21Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.’ 22And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said: ‘Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.’ 23And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe; 24and they turned and went up into the mountains, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 25And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: ‘Good is the land which the LORD our God giveth unto us.’ 26Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God; 27and ye murmured in your tents,
<br> 
<br>and said: ‘Because the LORD hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 28Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’ 29Then I said unto you: ‘Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 30The LORD your God who goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 31and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place. 32Yet in this thing ye do not believe the LORD your God, 33Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.’
<br>34And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying: 35’Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers, 36save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children; because he hath wholly followed the LORD.’ 37Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither; 38Joshua the son
<br> 
<br>of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither; encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 39Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 40But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’ 41Then ye answered and said unto me: ‘We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.’ And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country. 42And the LORD said unto me: ‘Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.’ 43So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. 44And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill- country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah. 45And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you. 46So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
<br>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
<br> 
<br>way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.
<br>2And the LORD spoke unto me, saying: 3’Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; turn you northward. 4And command thou the people, saying: Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; 5contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. 6Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 7For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.’ 8So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from Ezion-geber.
<br>And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 9And the LORD said unto me: ‘Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.— 10The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a
<br> 
<br>people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; 11these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 12And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.— 13Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.’ And we went over the brook Zered. 14And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation, even the men of war, were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the LORD swore unto them. 15Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to discomfit them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
<br>16So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 17that the LORD spoke unto me saying: 18’Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; 19and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, harass them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.— 20That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 21a people
<br> 
<br>great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead; 22as He did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day; 23and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.— 24Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon; behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 25This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who, when they hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.’
<br>26And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying: 27’Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 28Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on my feet; 29as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.’
<br> 
<br>30But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
<br>31And the LORD said unto me: ‘Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee; begin to possess his land.’ 32Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. 33And the LORD our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 34And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones; we left none remaining; 35only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. 36From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: the LORD our God delivered up all before us. 37Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever the LORD our God forbade us.
<br>
<br>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king
<br>of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei. 2And the LORD said unto me: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all
<br> 
<br>his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’ 3So the LORD our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 4And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5All these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many. 6And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones. 7But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.
<br>8And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon— 9which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir—10all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.— 11For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a
<br> 
<br>man.—12And this land we took in possession at that time; from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites; 13and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half- tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob—all that Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. 14Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth- jair, unto this day.—15And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 16And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley for a border; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 17the Arabah also, the Jordan being the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
<br>18And I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valour. 19But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle—I know that ye have much cattle—shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 20until the LORD give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the LORD
<br> 
<br>your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 21And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying: ‘Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings; so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. 22Ye shall not fear them; for the LORD your God, He it is that fighteth for you.’
<br>ואתחנן
<br>23And I besought the LORD at that time, saying: 24’O Lord GOD, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy mighty acts? 25Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.’ 26But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and the LORD said unto me: ‘Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto Me of this matter. 27Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 28But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.’ 29So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
<br> 
<br>And now, O Israel, hearken unto the		statutes	and	unto			the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, giveth you. 2Ye shall not add unto the word which I command		you,			neither		shall			ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. 3Your eyes have seen what the LORD did in Baal- peor; for all the men that followed the Baal of Peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee. 4But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day. 5Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it. 6Observe therefore and do them; for this		is	your		wisdom	and	your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that, when they hear all these statutes, shall say: ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ 7For what great nation is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is whensoever we call upon Him? 8And what great nation is	there,		that			hath		statutes		and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 9Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of
<br> 
<br>thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children; 10the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me: ‘Assemble Me the people, and I will make them hear My words that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.’ 11And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 12And the LORD spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only a voice. 13And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the ten words; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone. 14And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. 15Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves— for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire— 16lest ye deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, even the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 17the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven, 18the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
<br> 
<br>19and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven. 20But you hath the LORD taken and brought forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto Him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. 21Now the LORD was angered with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD   thy God giveth thee for an inheritance; 22but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye are to go over, and possess that good land. 23Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which He made with you, and make you a graven image, even the likeness of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. 24For the LORD thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
<br>25When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a graven image, even the form of any thing, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke Him; 26I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your
<br> 
<br>days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 27And the LORD shall scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither the LORD shall lead you away. 28And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 29But from thence ye will seek the LORD thy God; and thou shalt find Him, if thou search after Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. 30In thy distress, when all these things are come upon thee, in the end of days, thou wilt return to the LORD thy God, and hearken unto His voice; 31for the LORD thy God is a merciful God; He will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which He swore unto them. 32For ask now of the days past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? 33Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 34Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before thine eyes? 35Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightiest know
<br> 
<br>that the LORD, He is God; there is none else beside Him. 36Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee; and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire; and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire. 37And because He loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with His presence, with His great power, out of Egypt, 38to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day; 39know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else. 40And thou shalt keep His statutes, and His commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
<br>
<br>41Then Moses separated three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; 42that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 43Bezer in the wilderness, in the table-land, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
<br> 
<br>44And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel; 45these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt; 46beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt; 47and they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising; 48from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even unto mount Sion—the same is Hermon— 49and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
<br>And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them:
<br>Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them. 2The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 3The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. 4The LORD spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire— 5I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare unto you the word of the LORD; for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount—saying:
<br> 
<br>6I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<br>7Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. 8Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, even any manner of likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 9Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate Me, 10and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
<br>11Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.
<br>12Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD thy God commanded thee. 13Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; 14but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou. 15And thou shalt remember that thou was a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God brought thee out thence by a
<br> 
<br>mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
<br>16Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
<br>17Thou shalt not murder.
<br>Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither shalt thou steal.
<br>Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
<br>18Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid- servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
<br>19These words the LORD spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice, and it went on no more. And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me. 20And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 21and ye said: ‘Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire; we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth. 22Now therefore why should we die? for this
<br> 
<br>great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. 23For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 24Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God may say; and thou shalt speak unto us all that the LORD our God may speak unto thee; and we will hear it and do it.’ 25And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me; and the LORD said unto me: ‘I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee; they have well said all that they have spoken. 26Oh that they had such a heart as this alway, to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 27Go say to them: Return ye to your tents. 28But as for thee, stand thou here by Me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.’ 29Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 30Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
<br> 
<br>Now this is the commandment, the statutes,  and  the ordinances, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it— 2that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. 3Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee—a land flowing
<br>with milk and honey.
<br>4HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE LORD OUR GOD,
<br>THE LORD IS ONE. 5And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 6And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; 7and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 8And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. 9And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
<br>10And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land which He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee—great and goodly cities,
<br> 
<br>which thou didst not build, 11and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which thou the didst not hew, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied—12then beware lest thou forget the LORD, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 13Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; and Him shalt thou serve, and by His name shalt thou swear. 14Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you; 15for a jealous God, even the LORD thy God, is in the midst of thee; lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and He destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
<br>16Ye shall not try the LORD your God, as ye tried Him in Massah. 17Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies, and His statutes, which He hath commanded thee. 18And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore unto thy fathers, 19to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
<br>20When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: ‘What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? 21then thou
<br> 
<br>shalt say unto thy son: ‘We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 22And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes. 23And He brought us out from thence, that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore unto our fathers. 24And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. 25And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as He hath commanded us.’
<br>When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 2and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them; 3neither shalt thou make marriages with them: thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 4For he will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
<br> 
<br>against you, and He will destroy thee quickly. 5But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. 6For thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be His own treasure, out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. 7The LORD did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people—for ye were the fewest of all peoples— 8but because the LORD loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 9Know therefore that the LORD thy God, He is God; the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations; 10and repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them; He will not be slack to him that hateth Him, He will repay him to his face. 11Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
<br>עקב
<br>12And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy
<br> 
<br>God shall keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto thy fathers, 13and He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; He will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine and the young of thy flock, in the land which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee. 14Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 15And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness; and He will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. 16And thou shalt consume all the peoples that the LORD thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
<br>17If thou shalt say in thy heart: ‘These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?’ 18thou shalt not be afraid of them; thou shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt: 19the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out; so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid. 20Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and they that hide themselves, perish from before thee.
<br> 
<br>21Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for the LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a God great and awful. 22And the LORD thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little; thou mayest not consume them quickly, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. 23But the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed. 24And He shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven; there shall no man be able to stand against thee, until thou have destroyed them. 25The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. 26And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and be accursed like unto it; thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
<br>All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers. 2And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep His commandments,	or	no.	3And	He
<br> 
<br>afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 4Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 5And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. 6And thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD   thy God, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him. 7For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills; 8a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey; 9a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. 10And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the LORD thy God for the good land which He hath given thee. 11Beware lest thou forget the LORD thy God, in not keeping His commandments, and His ordinances, and His statutes, which I command thee this day; 12lest when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 13and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is
<br> 
<br>multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 14then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; 15who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 16who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that He might afflict thee, and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 17and thou say in thy heart: ‘My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.’ 18But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day.
<br>19And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I forewarn you this day that ye shall surely perish. 20As the nations that the LORD maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God.
<br>Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in
<br>to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, 2a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom
<br> 
<br>thou hast heard say: ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’ 3Know therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is He who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the LORD hath spoken unto thee. 4Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying: ‘For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land’; whereas for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. 5Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that He may establish the word which the LORD swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 6Know therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that the LORD thy God giveth thee this good land to possess it; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
<br>7Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the LORD thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. 8Also in Horeb ye made the LORD wroth, and the LORD was angered with you to have destroyed you. 9When I was gone up into the mount to
<br> 
<br>receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water. 10And the LORD delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 11And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 12And the LORD said unto me: ‘Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have dealt corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.’ 13Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying: ‘I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people; 14let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.’ 15So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 16And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you. 17And I took hold of
<br> 
<br>the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 18And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him. 19For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me that time also. 20Moreover the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 21And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.— 22And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made the LORD wroth. 23And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you’; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed Him not, nor hearkened to His voice. 24Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.— 25So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the LORD had said He would destroy you. 26And I prayed unto the LORD, and said: ‘O Lord GOD, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance,
<br> 
<br>that Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, that Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 27Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin; 28lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say: Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which He promised unto them, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 29Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm.’
<br>At that time the LORD said unto me: ‘Hew thee two tables of
<br>stone like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount; and make thee an ark of wood. 2And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.’ 3So I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand. 4And He wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten words, which the LORD spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them unto me. 5And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.— 6And the children
<br> 
<br>of Israel journeyed from Beeroth- benejaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead. 7From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod; and from Gudgod to Jotbah, a land of brooks of water.— 8At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day. 9Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God spoke unto him.—10Now I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me that time also; the LORD would not destroy thee. 11And the LORD said unto me: ‘Arise, go before the people, causing them to set forward, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.’
<br>12And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul; 13to keep for thy good the commandments of the LORD, and His statutes, which I command thee this day? 14Behold, unto the LORD thy God belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that therein is. 15Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to
<br> 
<br>love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you, above all peoples, as it is this day. 16Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 17For the LORD   your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awful, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward. 18He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 19Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 20Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; Him shalt thou serve; and to Him shalt thou cleave, and by His name shalt thou swear. 21He is thy glory, and He is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and tremendous things, which thine eyes have seen. 22Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
<br>Therefore thou shalt love the LORD   thy God, and keep His
<br>charge, and His statutes, and His ordinances, and His commandments, alway. 2And know ye this day; for I speak not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm, 3and His signs, and His works, which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 4and what He did unto the army of Egypt,
<br> 
<br>unto their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; 5and what He did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place; 6and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living substance that followed them, in the midst of all Israel; 7but your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did. 8Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it; 9and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>10For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and didst water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs; 11but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down; 12a land which the LORD thy God careth for; the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
<br> 
<br>13And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, 14that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 15And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. 16Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 17and the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain, and the ground shall not yield her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you. 18Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 19And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 20And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates; 21that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
<br> 
<br>22For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him, 23then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. 24Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border. 25There shall no man be able to stand against you: the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as He hath spoken unto you.
<br>ראה
<br>26Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: 27the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day; 28and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
<br>29And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 30Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of  the  sun,  in the land  of  the
<br> 
<br>Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the terebinths of Moreh? 31For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. 32And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
<br>
<br>These are the statutes and the ordinances,    which    ye    shall observe to do in the land which the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 2Ye shall surely destroy all the places, wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree. 3And ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. 4Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 5But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come; 6and thither ye shall bring your burnt- offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill- offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock; 7and there ye
<br> 
<br>shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. 8Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes; 9for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth thee. 10But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God causeth you to inherit, and He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 11then it shall come to pass that the place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD. 12And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men- servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you. 13Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt- offerings in every place that thou seest; 14but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
<br>15Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after
<br> 
<br>all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. 16Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 17Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill- offerings, nor the offering of thy hand; 18but thou shalt eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. 19Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land.
<br>20When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee, and thou shalt say: ‘I will eat flesh’, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul. 21If the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to put His name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul. 22Howbeit as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
<br> 
<br>thereof; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike. 23Only be stedfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh. 24Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. 25Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD. 26Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose; 27and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out against the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 28Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
<br>29When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land; 30take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying: ‘How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.’ 31Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God; for every abomination to the LORD, which He
<br> 
<br>hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.
<br>
<br>All	this	word	which	I command you,   that   shall   ye observe to do; thou shalt not add
<br>thereto, nor diminish from it.
<br>2If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams—and he give thee a sign or a wonder, 3and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee—saying: ‘Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them’; 4thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God putteth you to proof, to know whether ye do love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 5After the LORD your God shall ye walk, and Him shall ye fear, and His commandments shall ye keep, and unto His voice shall ye hearken, and Him shall ye serve, and unto Him shall ye cleave. 6And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken perversion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>7If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend,
<br> 
<br>that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying: ‘Let us go and serve other gods, ‘which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 8of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 9thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him; 10but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 11And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to draw thee away from the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 12And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.
<br>13If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying: 14’Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying: Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known’; 15then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee; 16thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it
<br> 
<br>utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 17And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto the LORD thy God; and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again. 18And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers; 19 when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all His commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
<br>Ye are the children of the LORD your God:  ye shall not
<br>cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. 2For thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be His own treasure out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
<br>3Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 4These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 5the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the mountain-sheep. 6And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof wholly cloven in two, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that ye may eat.
<br> 
<br>7Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rock- badger, because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you; 8and the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you; of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch.
<br>9These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat; 10and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you.
<br>11Of all clean birds ye may eat. 12But
<br>these are they of which ye shall not eat: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the ospray; 13and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kinds; 14and every raven after its kinds; 15and the ostrich, and the night- hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds; 16the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl; 17and the pelican, and the carrion-vulture, and the cormorant; 18and the stork, and the heron after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 19And all winged swarming things are unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten. 20Of all clean winged things ye may eat.
<br>21Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself; thou mayest give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner; for thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou
<br> 
<br>shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.
<br>22Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which is brought forth in the field year by year. 23And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always. 24And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set His name there, when the LORD thy God shall bless thee; 25then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose. 26And thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household. 27And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.
<br>28At the end of every three years, even in the same year, thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase, and shall lay it up within thy gates. 29And the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the
<br> 
<br>stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.
<br>At the end of every seven years		thou	shalt		make	a release. 2And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbour; he shall not exact it of his neighbour and his brother; because the LORD’S release hath been proclaimed. 3Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it; but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother			thy		hand			shall			release. 4Howbeit there shall be no needy among you—for the LORD will surely bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it— 5if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God,	to		observe	to		do		all	this commandment which I command thee this day. 6For the LORD thy God will bless thee, as He promised thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall
<br>not rule over thee.
<br>7If there be among you a needy man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates, in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother; 8but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need
<br> 
<br>in that which he wanteth. 9Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying: ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand’; and thine eye be evil against thy needy brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin in thee. 10Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing the LORD thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. 11For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying: ‘Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy poor and needy brother, in thy land.’
<br>12If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. 13And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; 14thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. 15And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing to-day. 16And it shall be, if he say unto thee: ‘I will not go out from thee’; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he fareth well with thee; 17then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his
<br> 
<br>ear and into the door, and he shall be thy bondman for ever. And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise. 18It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years; and the LORD thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.
<br>19All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God; thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock. 20Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. 21And if there be any blemish therein, lameness, or blindness, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. 22Thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the unclean and the clean may eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart. 23Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.
<br>Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the
<br>LORD thy God; for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. 2And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the LORD   thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. 3Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt    thou    eat    unleavened    bread
<br> 
<br>therewith, even the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou come forth out of the land of Egypt; that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 4And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all they borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 5Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover-offering within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee; 6but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover- offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 7And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. 8Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God; thou shalt do no work therein.
<br>9Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn shalt thou begin to number seven weeks. 10And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as the LORD thy God blesseth thee. 11And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy
<br> 
<br>daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within they gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. 12And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
<br>13Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing- floor and from thy winepress. 14And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates. 15Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose; because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful. 16Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which He shall choose; on the feast of unleavened bread, and on the feast of weeks, and on the feast of tabernacles; and they shall not appear before the LORD empty; 17every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee.
<br> 
<br>שפטים
<br>18Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. 19Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 20Justice, justice shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
<br>21Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee. 22Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar, which the LORD thy God hateth.
<br>Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God an ox, or a
<br>sheep, wherein is a blemish, even any evil thing; for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
<br>2If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing His covenant, 3and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have commanded not; 4and it be told thee, and thou hear it, then shalt thou inquire diligently, and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is
<br> 
<br>wrought in Israel; 5then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them with stones, that they die. 6At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. 7The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>8If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, even matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose. 9And thou shall come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days; and thou shalt inquire; and they shall declare unto thee the sentence of judgment. 10And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall declare unto thee from that place which the LORD shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee. 11According to the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left. 12And the man
<br> 
<br>that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die; and thou shalt exterminate the evil from Israel. 13And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
<br>14When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein; and shalt say: ‘I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me’; 15thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose; one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother. 16Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses; forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you: ‘Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.’ 17Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 18And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites. 19And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; 20that his heart be not lifted up above his
<br> 
<br>brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
<br>The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have
<br>no portion nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and His inheritance. 2And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the LORD is their inheritance, as He hath spoken unto them.
<br>3And this shall be the priests’due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 4The first-fruits of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. 5For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.
<br>6And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which the LORD shall choose; 7then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before the LORD. 8They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which is his due according to the fathers’houses.
<br> 
<br>9When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. 10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 11or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a necromancer. 12For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the LORD; and because of these abominations the LORD thy God is driving them out from before thee. 13Thou shalt be whole- hearted with the LORD thy God. 14For these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto soothsayers, and unto diviners; but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do. 15A prophet will the LORD thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; 16according to all that thou didst desire of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying: ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.’ 17And the LORD said unto me: ‘They have well said that which they have spoken. 18I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. 19And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
<br> 
<br>unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him. 20But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’ 21And if thou say in thy heart: ‘How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?’ 22When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.
<br>When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land
<br>the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou dost succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; 2thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy GOD giveth thee to possess it. 3Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which the LORD thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither. 4And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; 5as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and
<br> 
<br>live; 6lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not deserving of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. 7Wherefore I command thee, saying: ‘Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.’ 8And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers— 9if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in His ways—then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three; 10that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
<br>11But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee into one of these cities; 12then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 13Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the blood of the innocent from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
<br>14Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the  land
<br> 
<br>that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
<br>15One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be establishment16If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to bear perverted witness against him; 17then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days. 18And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 19then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. 20And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. 21And thine eye shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
<br>
<br>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies,
<br>and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for the LORD thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 2And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 3and shall say unto them: ‘Hear, O Israel, ye  draw
<br> 
<br>nigh this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, neither be ye affrighted at them; 4for the LORD your God is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’ 5And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying: ‘What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 6And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof. 7And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.’ 8And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say: ‘What man is there that is fearful and faint- hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart.’ 9And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that captains of hosts shall be appointed at the head of the people.
<br>10When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 11And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall
<br> 
<br>serve thee. 12And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it. 13And when the LORD thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword; 14but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. 15Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. 16Howbeit of the cities of these peoples, that the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth, 17but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; 18that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, and so ye sin against the LORD your God.
<br>19When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, but thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee? 20Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, them thou mayest destroy and cut down, that thou mayest
<br> 
<br>build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.
<br>If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
<br>giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; 2then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain. 3And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke. 4And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley. 5And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near—for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. 6And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. 7And they shall speak and say: ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 8Forgive, O LORD, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.’ And the blood shall be forgiven them. 9So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the
<br> 
<br>midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD.
<br>כי תצא
<br>10When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, 11and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; 12then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 13and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. 14And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.
<br>15If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first- born son be hers that was hated; 16then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born; 17but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for
<br> 
<br>he is the first-fruits of his strength, the right of the first-born is his.
<br>18If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; 19then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 20and they shall say unto the elders of his city: ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.’ 21And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
<br>22And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; 23his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God; that thou defile not thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
<br>Thou shalt not see thy brother’s   ox   or   his   sheep
<br>driven away, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely bring them back unto thy brother. 2And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother require it, and thou shalt restore it to him. 3And so
<br> 
<br>shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found; thou mayest not hide thyself.
<br>4Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
<br>5A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
<br>6If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young; 7thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.
<br>8When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence. 9Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed; lest the fulness of the seed which thou hast sown be forfeited together with the increase of
<br>the vineyard.
<br>10Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. 11Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.
<br> 
<br>12Thou shalt make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
<br>13If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 14and lay wanton charges against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say: ‘I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity’; 15then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate. 16And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders: ‘I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 17and, lo, he hath laid wanton charges, saying: I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.’ And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. 18And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. 19And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
<br>20But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; 21then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die; because she hath wrought a wanton
<br> 
<br>deed in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>22If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel.
<br>23If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 24then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die: the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife; so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>25But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man take hold of her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die. 26But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter. 27For he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
<br>28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be
<br> 
<br>his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
<br>A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not
<br>uncover his father’s skirt.
<br>2He that is crushed or maimed in his privy parts shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD.
<br>3A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of the LORD.
<br>4An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the assembly of the LORD for ever; 5because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Aram- naharaim, to curse thee. 6Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. 7Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
<br>8Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. 9The children of the third generation that are born unto them may enter into the assembly of the LORD.
<br>10When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt
<br> 
<br>keep thee from every evil thing. 11If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp. 12But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp. 13Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad. 14And thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee. 15For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy; that He see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
<br>16Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a bondman that is escaped from his master unto thee; 17he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him.
<br>18There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 19Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow; for even both these are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
<br> 
<br>20Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother: interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest. 21Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
<br>22When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it will be sin in thee. 23But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 24That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed freely unto the LORD thy God, even that which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
<br>25When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes until thou have enough at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.
<br>26When thou comest into thy neighbour’s standing corn, then thou mayest pluck ears with thy hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing corn.
<br>When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it cometh to
<br>pass, if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house,
<br> 
<br>2and she departeth out of his house, and goeth and becometh another man’s wife, 3and the latter husband hateth her, and writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; 4her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
<br>5When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.
<br>6No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.
<br>7If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, and sell him; then that thief shall die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>8Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you, as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. 9Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt.
<br>10When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou
<br> 
<br>shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. 11Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee. 12And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge; 13thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.
<br>14Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates. 15In the same day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD and it be sin in thee.
<br>16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
<br>17Thou shalt not pervert the justice due to the stranger, or to the fatherless; nor take the widow’s raiment to pledge. 18But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
<br>19When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that the
<br> 
<br>LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.
<br>20When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 21When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 22And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.
<br>If there be a controversy between men, and they come
<br>unto judgment, and the judges judge them, by justifying the righteous, and condemning the wicked, 2then it shall be, if the wicked man deserve to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to the measure of his wickedness, by number. 3Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should be dishonoured before thine eyes.
<br>4Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.
<br>5If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not be married abroad unto one not of his kin; her husband’s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her. 6And it shall be, that
<br> 
<br>the first-born that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead, that his name be not blotted out of Israel. 7And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders, and say: ‘My husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto me.’ 8Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him; and if he stand, and say: ‘I like not to take her’; 9then shall his brother’s wife draw nigh unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say: ‘So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brother’s house.’ 10And his name shall be called in Israel The house of him that had his shoe loosed.
<br>11When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets; 12then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity.
<br>13Thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small. 14Thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures, a great and a small. 15A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God
<br> 
<br>giveth thee. 16For all that do such things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
<br>17Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt; 18how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were enfeebled in thy rear, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. 19Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget.
<br>כי תבוא
<br>And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which
<br>the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and dost possess it, and dwell therein; 2that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. 3And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him: ‘I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the land which the LORD swore unto our fathers to give us.’ 4And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar
<br> 
<br>of the LORD thy God. 5And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God: ‘A wandering Aramean was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty,			and		populous.	6And		the Egyptians   dealt   ill		with				us,	and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7And we cried unto the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the LORD heard	our		voice,	and		saw	our affliction,		and		our		toil,			and	our oppression. 8And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders. 9And He hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which Thou, O LORD, hast given me.’ And thou shalt set it down before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God. 11And thou shalt rejoice in all the good which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is in the midst of thee. 12When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite,		to		the		stranger,				to		the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be satisfied, 13then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God: ‘I have put away the
<br> 
<br>hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all Thy commandment which Thou hast commanded me; I have not transgressed any of Thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them. 14I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead; I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me. 15Look forth from Thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Thy people Israel, and the land which Thou hast given us, as Thou didst swear unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.’
<br>16This day the LORD thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances; thou shalt therefore observe and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. 17Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in His ways, and keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances, and hearken unto His voice. 18And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be His own treasure, as He hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments; 19and to make thee high above all nations that He hath made, in praise, and in name, and in glory; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the LORD thy God, as He hath spoken.
<br> 
<br>
<br>And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people,
<br>saying: ‘Keep all the commandment which I command you this day. 2And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster. 3And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee. 4And it shall be when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster. 5And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones; thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them. 6Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of unhewn stones; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God. 7And thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God. 8And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.’
<br>9And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, saying: ‘Keep silence, and hear, O Israel; this day thou art become a people unto the LORD thy God. 10Thou shalt therefore hearken to the voice of the LORD thy
<br> 
<br>God, and do His commandments and His statutes, which I command thee this day.’ 11And Moses charged the people the same day, saying: 12’These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin; 13and these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 14And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
<br>15Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen.
<br>16Cursed be he that dishonoureth his father or his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>17Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour’s landmark. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>18Cursed be he that maketh the blind to go astray in the way. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>19Cursed be he that perverteth the justice due to the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>20Cursed be he that lieth with his father’s wife; because he hath uncovered his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br> 
<br>21Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>22Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>23Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>24Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour in secret. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>25Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>26Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say: Amen.’
<br>And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
<br>unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all His commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth. 2And all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. 3Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. 4Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the young of thy flock. 5Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading- trough. 6Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 7The LORD
<br> 
<br>will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee; they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways. 8The LORD will command the blessing with thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto; and He will bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 9The LORD will establish thee for a holy people unto Himself, as He hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in His ways. 10And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon thee; and they shall be afraid of thee. 11And the LORD will make thee over-abundant for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, in the land which the LORD swore unto thy fathers to give thee. 12The LORD will open unto thee His good treasure the heaven to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow. 13And the LORD will make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them; 14and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
<br> 
<br>15But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. 16Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. 17Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough. 18Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the young of thy flock. 19Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 20The LORD will send upon thee cursing, discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the evil of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken Me. 21The LORD will make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until He have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it. 22The LORD will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with drought, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish. 23And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. 24The LORD will make the rain of thy land powder and dust; from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 25The LORD will cause  thee to be smitten before
<br> 
<br>thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before them; and thou shalt be a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth. 26And thy carcasses shall be food unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and there shall be none to frighten them away.
<br>27The LORD will smite thee with the boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. 28The LORD will smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart. 29And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not make thy ways prosperous; and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed alway, and there shall be none to save thee. 30Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein; thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof. 31Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee; thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies; and thou shalt have none to save thee. 32Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day; and there shall be nought in the power of thy hand. 33The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not
<br> 
<br>eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed away: 34so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 35The LORD will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head. 36The LORD will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. 37And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither the LORD shall lead thee away.
<br>38Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. 39Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them. 40Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olives shall drop off. 41Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity. 42All thy trees and the fruit of thy land shall the locust possess.
<br>43The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower. 44He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 45And all these curses shall come
<br> 
<br>upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee. 46And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever; 47because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; 48therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
<br>49The LORD will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoopeth down; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; 50a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favour to the young. 51And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee corn, wine, or oil, the increase of thy kine, or the young of thy flock, until he have caused thee to perish. 52And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou didst trust, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. 53And thou shalt eat the fruit of
<br> 
<br>thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters whom the LORD thy God hath given thee; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall straiten thee. 54The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil against his brother, and against the wife of his bosom, and against the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining; 55so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in all thy gates. 56The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil against the husband of her bosom, and against her son, and against her daughter; 57and against her afterbirth that cometh out from between her feet, and against her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in thy gates.
<br>58If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and awful Name, the LORD thy God; 59then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. 60And He
<br> 
<br>will bring back upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast in dread of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 61Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 62And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. 63And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it. 64And the LORD shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone. 65And among these nations shalt thou have no repose, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot; but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul. 66And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life. 67In the morning thou shalt say: ‘Would it were even! ’ and at even thou shalt say: ‘Would it were morning! ’ for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  68And the LORD shall
<br> 
<br>bring thee back into Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee: ‘Thou shalt see it no more again’; and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwoman, and no man shall buy you.
<br>69These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.
<br>And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them:
<br>Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 2the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs and those great wonders; 3but the LORD hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. 4And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 5Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye might know that I am the LORD your God. 6And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them. 7And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. 8Observe therefore the words of this
<br> 
<br>covenant, and do them, that ye may make all that ye do to prosper.
<br>נצבים
<br>9Ye are standing this day all of you before the LORD your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, 10your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in the midst of thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water; 11that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the LORD thy God—and into His oath—which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day; 12that He may establish thee this day unto Himself for a people, and that He may be unto thee a God, as He spoke unto thee, and as He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 13Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 14but with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day—
<br>15 for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed; 16and ye have seen their detestable things, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were with them—17lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 18 and it come to pass,
<br> 
<br>when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying: ‘I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart—that the watered be swept away with the dry’; 19the LORD will not be willing to pardon him, but then the anger of the LORD and His jealousy shall be kindled against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven; 20and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law. 21And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith the LORD hath made it sick; 22and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath; 23even all the nations shall say ‘Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?’ 24then men shall say: ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt; 25and went and served other gods, and worshipped
<br> 
<br>them, gods that they knew not, and that He had not allotted unto them; 26therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book; 27and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day’.— 28 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
<br>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come
<br>upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt bethink thyself among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee, 2and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; 3that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee. 4If any of thine that are dispersed be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will He fetch thee. 5And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
<br> 
<br>6And the LORD thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. 7And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee. 8And thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of the LORD, and do all His commandments which I command thee this day. 9And the LORD thy God will make thee over- abundant in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good; for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers; 10if thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<br>11For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. 12It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: ‘Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?’ 13Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: ‘Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?’ 14But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
<br> 
<br>15See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, 16in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live and multiply, and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. 17But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 18I declare unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 19I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; 20to love the LORD thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

<br>And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel.
<br>2And he said unto them: ‘I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in; and the LORD hath said unto me: Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 3The LORD thy God, He will go over before thee; He
<br> 
<br>will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them; and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. 4And the LORD will do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom He destroyed. 5And the LORD will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the	commandment	which	I	have commanded you. 6Be strong and of good		courage,	fear		not,	nor		be affrighted at them; for the LORD thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.’ 7And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: ‘Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this people into the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 8And the LORD, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear not,
<br>neither be dismayed.’
<br>9And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel. 10And Moses commanded them, saying: ‘At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 11when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which He shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their
<br> 
<br>hearing. 12Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 13and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.’
<br>14And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Behold, thy days approach that thou must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge.’ And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. 15And the LORD appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 16And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I have made with them. 17Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? 18And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they
<br> 
<br>are turned unto other gods. 19Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel. 20For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten their fill, and waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant; 21then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination how they do even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.’ 22So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. 23And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said: ‘Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee.’
<br>24And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 25that Moses commanded the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying: 26’Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. 27For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck;
<br> 
<br>behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? 28Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 29For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the end of days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him through the work of your hands.’ 30And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished:
<br>האזינו
<br>Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;
<br>And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
<br>2My doctrine shall drop as the rain, My speech shall distil as the dew;
<br>As the small rain upon the tender grass,
<br>And as the showers upon the herb.
<br>3For I will proclaim the name of the LORD;
<br>Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
<br>
<br>4The Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are justice;
<br>A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,
<br>Just and right is He.
<br> 
<br>5Is corruption His? No; His children’s is the blemish;
<br>A generation crooked and perverse.
<br>6Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise?
<br>Is not He thy father that hath gotten thee?
<br>Hath He not made thee, and established thee?
<br>
<br>7Remember the days of old,
<br>Consider the years of many generations;
<br>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee,
<br>Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
<br>8When the Most High gave to the nations
<br>When He separated the children of men,
<br>He set the borders of the peoples According to the number of the
<br>children of Israel.
<br>9For the portion of the LORD is His people,
<br>Jacob the lot of His inheritance.
<br>
<br>10He found him in a desert land,
<br>And in the waste, a howling wilderness;
<br>He compassed him about, He cared for him,
<br>He kept him as the apple of His eye.
<br>11As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,
<br>Hovereth over her young,
<br>Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
<br>Beareth them on her pinions—
<br> 
<br>12The LORD alone did lead him, And there was no strange god with
<br>Him.
<br>
<br>13He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
<br>And he did eat the fruitage of the field;
<br>And He made him to suck honey out of the crag,
<br>And oil out of the flinty rock; 14Curd of kine, and milk of sheep, With fat of lambs,
<br>And rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats,
<br>With the kidney-fat of wheat;
<br>And of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine.
<br>
<br>15But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked—
<br>Thou didst wax fat, thou didst grow thick, thou didst become gross—
<br>And he forsook God who made him,
<br>And contemned the Rock of his salvation.
<br>16They roused Him to jealousy with strange gods,
<br>With abominations did they provoke Him.
<br>17They sacrificed unto demons, no- gods,
<br>Gods that they knew not,
<br>New gods that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not. 18Of the Rock that begot thee thou
<br>wast unmindful,
<br>And didst forget God that bore thee.
<br> 
<br>19And the LORD saw, and spurned,
<br>Because of the provoking of His sons and
<br>His daughters.
<br>20And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them,
<br>I will see what their end shall be;
<br>For they are a very froward generation,
<br>Children in whom is no faithfulness.
<br>21They have roused Me to jealousy with a no-god;
<br>They have provoked Me with their vanities;
<br>And I will rouse them to jealousy with a no-people;
<br>I will provoke them with a vile nation. 22For a fire is kindled in My nostril,
<br>And burneth unto the depths of the nether-world,
<br>And devoureth the earth with her produce,
<br>And setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains.
<br>
<br>23I will heap evils upon them;
<br>I will spend Mine arrows upon them;
<br>24The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt,
<br>And bitter destruction;
<br>And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,
<br>With the venom of crawling things of the dust.
<br>25Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror;
<br>Slaying both young man and virgin,
<br> 
<br>The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
<br>
<br>26I thought I would make an end of them,
<br>I would make their memory cease from among men;
<br>27Were it not that I dreaded the enemy’s provocation,
<br>Lest their adversaries should misdeem,
<br>Lest they should say: Our hand is exalted,
<br>And not the LORD hath wrought all this.’
<br>
<br>28For they are a nation void of counsel,
<br>And there is no understanding in them.
<br>29If they were wise, they would understand this,
<br>They would discern their latter end. 30How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight,
<br>Except their Rock had given them over
<br>And the LORD had delivered them up?
<br>31For their rock is not as our Rock,
<br>Even our enemies themselves being judges.
<br>32For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
<br>And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter; 33Their wine is the venom of
<br>serpents,
<br> 
<br>And the cruel poison of asps.
<br>
<br>34’Is not this laid up in store with Me,
<br>Sealed up in My treasuries?
<br>35Vengeance is Mine, and recompense,
<br>Against the time when their foot shall slip;
<br>For the day of their calamity is at hand,
<br>And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
<br>
<br>36For the LORD will judge His people,
<br>And repent Himself for His servants;
<br>When He seeth that their stay is gone,
<br>And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.
<br>37And it is said: Where are their gods,
<br>The rock in whom they trusted;
<br>38Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
<br>And drank the wine of their drink- offering?
<br>Let him rise up and help you, Let him be your protection.
<br>
<br>39See now that I, even I, am He, And there is no god with Me;
<br>I kill, and I make alive;
<br>I have wounded, and I heal;
<br>And there is none that can deliver out of My hand.
<br>40For I lift up My hand to heaven,
<br> 
<br>And say: As I live for ever,
<br>41If I whet My glittering sword,
<br>And My hand take hold on judgment;
<br>I will render vengeance to Mine adversaries,
<br>And will recompense them that hate Me.
<br>42I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood,
<br>And My sword shall devour flesh;
<br>With the blood of the slain and the captives,
<br>From the long-haired heads of the enemy.’
<br>
<br>43Sing aloud, O ye nations, of His people;
<br>For He doth avenge the blood of His servants,
<br>And doth render vengeance to His adversaries,
<br>And doth make expiation for the land of His people.
<br>
<br>44And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 45And when Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel, 46he said unto them: ‘Set your heart unto all the words wherewith I testify against you this day; that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law. 47For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon
<br> 
<br>the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.’
<br>48And the LORD spoke unto Moses that selfsame day, saying: 49’Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; 50and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people. 51Because ye trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel. 52For thou shalt see the land afar off; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.’

<br>And	this	is	the	blessing wherewith Moses the man of
<br>God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 2And he said:
<br>The LORD came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them;
<br>He shined forth from mount Paran,
<br>And He came from the myriads holy,
<br>At His right hand was a fiery law unto	them.
<br>3Yea, He loveth the peoples,
<br>All His holy ones—they are in Thy hand;
<br>And they sit down at Thy feet,
<br> 
<br>Receiving of Thy words.
<br>4Moses commanded us a law,
<br>An inheritance of the congregation of
<br>Jacob.
<br>5And there was a king in Jeshurun,
<br>When the heads of the people were gathered,
<br>All the tribes of Israel together.
<br>
<br>6Let Reuben live, and not die In that his men become few.
<br>
<br>7And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people; His hands shall contend for him,
<br>And Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.
<br>
<br>8And of Levi he said:
<br>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one,
<br>Whom Thou didst prove at Massah,
<br>With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
<br>9Who said of his father, and of his mother: ‘I have not seen him’;
<br>Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
<br>Nor knew he his own children; For they have observed Thy word, And keep Thy covenant.
<br>10They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances,
<br>And Israel Thy law;
<br>They shall put incense before Thee, And whole burnt-offering upon
<br>Thine altar.
<br> 
<br>11Bless, LORD, his substance,
<br>And accept the work of his hands;
<br>Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,
<br>And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
<br>
<br>12Of Benjamin he said:
<br>The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him;
<br>He covereth him all the day,
<br>And He dwelleth between his shoulders.
<br>
<br>13And of Joseph he said: Blessed of the LORD be his land;
<br>For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
<br>And for the deep that coucheth beneath,
<br>14And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,
<br>And for the precious things of the yield of the moons,
<br>15And for the tops of the ancient mountains,
<br>And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
<br>16And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,
<br>And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush;
<br>Let the blessing come upon the head of
<br>Joseph,
<br>And upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren.
<br> 
<br>17His firstling bullock, majesty is his;
<br>And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox;
<br>With them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth;
<br>And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
<br>And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
<br>
<br>18And of Zebulun he said:
<br>Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, And, Issachar, in thy tents.
<br>19They shall call peoples unto the mountain;
<br>There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness;
<br>For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,
<br>And the hidden treasures of the sand.
<br>
<br>20And of Gad he said:
<br>Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad; He dwelleth as a lioness,
<br>And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
<br>21And he chose a first part for himself,
<br>For there a portion of a ruler was reserved;
<br>And there came the heads of the people,
<br>He executed the righteousness of the LORD,
<br>And His ordinances with Israel.
<br> 
<br>22And of Dan he said:
<br>Dan is a lion’s whelp,
<br>That leapeth forth from Bashan.
<br>
<br>23And of Naphtali he said:
<br>O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, And full with the blessing of the
<br>LORD:
<br>Possess thou the sea and the south.
<br>
<br>24And of Asher he said: Blessed be Asher above sons;
<br>Let him be the favoured of his brethren,
<br>And let him dip his foot in oil.
<br>25Iron and brass shall be thy bars;
<br>And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
<br>
<br>26There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,
<br>Who rideth upon the heaven as thy help,
<br>And in His excellency on the skies.
<br>27The eternal God is a dwelling- place,
<br>And underneath are the everlasting arms;
<br>And He thrust out the enemy from before thee,
<br>And said: ‘Destroy.’
<br>28And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of corn and wine;
<br>Yea, his heavens drop down dew.
<br>29Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee?
<br>A people saved by the LORD, The shield of thy help,
<br> 
<br>And that is the sword of thy excellency!
<br>And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee;
<br>And thou shalt tread upon their high places.
<br>
<br>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount
<br>Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, even Gilead as far as Dan; 2and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder sea; 3and the South, and the Plain, even the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. 4And the LORD said unto him: ‘This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.’ 5So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. 6And he was buried in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 7And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 8And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. 9And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon
<br> 
<br>him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. 10And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face; 11in all the signs and the
<br> 
<br>wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; 12and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

<br> 
<br>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spoke unto Joshua the	son	of	Nun,	Moses’minister, saying: 2’Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. 3Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spoke unto Moses. 4From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border. 5There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 6Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I swore unto their fathers to give them. 7Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses My servant commanded thee; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. 8This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
<br> 
<br>observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. 9Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.’
<br>10Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying: 11’Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying: Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.’
<br>12And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying: 13’Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, you, saying: The LORD your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land. 14Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them; 15until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as unto you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them; then ye
<br> 
<br>shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.’
<br>16And they answered Joshua, saying: ‘All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. 17According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only the LORD thy God be with thee, as He was with Moses. 18Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death; only be strong and of good courage.’
<br>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two spies secretly, saying:	‘Go	view	the	land,	and Jericho.’ And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. 2And it was told the king of Jericho, saying: ‘Behold, there came men in hither to- night of the children of Israel to search out the land.’ 3And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying: ‘Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.’ 4And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said: ‘Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were; 5and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not;
<br> 
<br>pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.’ 6But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had spread out upon the roof. 7And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, the gate was shut. 8And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; 9and she said unto the men: ‘I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. 10For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 11And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. 12Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house— and give me a true token—13and save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.’ 14And the men said unto her: ‘Our life for yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we
<br> 
<br>will deal kindly and truly with thee.’ 15Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 16And she said unto them: ‘Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward may ye go your way.’ 17And the men said unto her: ‘We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 18Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household. 19And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. 20But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.’ 21And she said: ‘According unto your words, so be it.’ And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window. 22And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. 23Then the two men returned, and
<br> 
<br>descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. 24And they said unto Joshua: ‘Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.’
<br>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. 2And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst	of	the	camp;	3and	they commanded the people, saying: ‘When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. 4Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this
<br>way heretofore.’
<br>5And Joshua said unto the people: ‘Sanctify yourselves; for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.’ 6And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying: ‘Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people.’ And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
<br>7And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may
<br> 
<br>know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. 8And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying: When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.’
<br>9And Joshua said unto the children of Israel: ‘Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.’ 10And Joshua said: ‘Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite. 11Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth on before you over the Jordan. 12Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man. 13And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.’ 14And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bore the ark of the covenant being before the people; 15and when they that bore the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water—for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all
<br> 
<br>the time of harvest—16that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over right against Jericho. 17And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.
<br>And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan,   that   the   LORD    spoke unto Joshua, saying: 2’Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 3and command ye them, saying: Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’feet stood, twelve stones made ready, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging- place, where ye shall lodge this night.’ 4Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man; 5and Joshua said unto them: ‘Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; 6that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying: What mean ye by these stones? 7then ye shall say unto them:
<br> 
<br>Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.’ 8And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the LORD spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. 9Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there unto this day. 10And the priests that bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over. 11And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed on, and the priests, before the people. 12And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed on armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke unto them; 13about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
<br> 
<br>14On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
<br>15And the LORD spoke unto Joshua, saying: 16’Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.’ 17Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying: ‘Come ye up out of the Jordan.’ 18And it came to pass, as the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the midst of the Jordan, as soon as the soles of the priests’feet were drawn up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime. 19And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho. 20And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal. 21And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying: ‘When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying: What mean these stones? 22then ye shall let your children know, saying: Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 23For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up from before us, until we were passed over, 24that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD, that it
<br> 
<br>is mighty; that ye may fear the LORD your God for ever.’
<br>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of
<br>Israel.
<br>2At that time the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.’ 3And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at aGibeath-ha- araloth. 4And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt. 5For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. 6For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD; unto whom the LORD swore that He would not let them see the land
<br> 
<br>which the LORD swore unto their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 7And He raised up their children in their stead; them did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way. 8And it came to pass, when all the nation were circumcised, every one of them, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
<br>9And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.’ Wherefore the name of that place was called bGilgal, unto this day.
<br>10And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 11And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day. 12And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
<br>13And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him: ‘Art thou for us, or for our  adversaries?’
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a That is, The hill of the foreskins.	b That is, Rolling.
<br> 
<br>14And he said: ‘Nay, but I am captain of the host of the LORD; I am now come.’ And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto him: ‘What saith my lord unto his servant?’ 15And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua: ‘Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.’ And Joshua did so.
<br>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.— 2And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, even the mighty men of valour. 3And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 4And seven priests shall bear seven rams’horns before the ark; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the horns. 5And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the horn, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.’ 6And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them:	‘Take	up	the	ark	of	the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven rams’horns before the ark of the LORD.’ 7And he said unto the people: ‘Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed body pass on before the ark of the LORD.’ 8And it was so, that when
<br> 
<br>Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven	priests	bearing	the	seven rams’horns before the LORD passed on, and blew with the horns; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 9And the armed men went before the priests that blew the horns, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing with the horns continually. 10And Joshua commanded the people, saying: ‘Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.’ 11So he caused the ark of the LORD to compass the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 12And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 13And the seven priests bearing the seven rams’horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the horns; and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of the LORD, [the priests] blowing with the	horns	continually.	14And	the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp; so they did six days. 15And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 16And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the horns, that Joshua said unto the
<br> 
<br>people: ‘Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. 17And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 18And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed by taking of the devoted thing, so should ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it. 19But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto the LORD; they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.’ 20So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew with the horns. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 21And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 22And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land: ‘Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore unto her.’ 23And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel. 24And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was
<br> 
<br>therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. 25But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day; because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
<br>26And Joshua charged the people with an oath at that time, saying: ‘Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city, even Jericho; with the loss of his first- born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.’
<br>27So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
<br>But the children of Israel committed a trespass concerning
<br>the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
<br>2And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke unto them, saying: ‘Go up and spy out the land.’ And the men went up and spied out Ai. 3And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him: ‘Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.’ 4So there
<br> 
<br>went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of Ai. 5And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. 6And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads. 7And Joshua said: ‘Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan! 8Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies! 9For when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear of it, they will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt Thou do for Thy great name?’
<br>10And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘Get thee up; wherefore, now, art thou fallen upon thy face? 11Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff. 12Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies,
<br> 
<br>because they are become accursed; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. 13Up, sanctify the people, and say: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: There is a curse in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. 14In the morning therefore ye shall draw near by your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come near by families; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come near by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come near man by man. 15And it shall be that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought a wanton deed in Israel.’
<br>16So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken. 17And he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites. And he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken. 18And he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 19And Joshua said unto Achan: ‘My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the
<br> 
<br>LORD, the God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide nothing from me.’ 20And Achan answered Joshua, and said: ‘Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. 21When I saw among the spoil a goodly Shinar mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.’ 22So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 23And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD. 24And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor. 25And Joshua said: ‘Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day.’ And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones. 26And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Wherefore the name of that
<br> 
<br>place was called The valley of aAchor, unto this day.
<br>And the LORD  said unto Joshua: ‘Fear	not,	neither	be	thou dismayed; take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land. 2And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king; only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves; set thee an ambush for the city behind it.’ 3So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night. 4And he commanded them, saying: ‘Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready. 5And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them. 6And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say: They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them. 7And ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 8And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire;
<br>
<br>a That is, Troubling.
<br> 
<br>according to the word of the LORD shall ye do; see, I have commanded you.’ 9And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
<br>10And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 11And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai—now there was a valley between him and Ai. 12And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai. 13So the people set themselves in array, even all the host that was on the north of the city, their rear lying in wait on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale. 14And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hastened and rose up early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, in front of the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city. 15And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 16And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 17And there was
<br> 
<br>not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
<br>18And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand.’ And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. 19And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and set the city on fire. 20And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 21And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back, and slew the men of Ai. 22And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 23And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
<br>24And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto
<br> 
<br>Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 25And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 26For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 27Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which He commanded Joshua. 28So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day. 29And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.
<br>30Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal, 31as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron; and they offered thereon burnt- offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings. 32And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote before the children of Israel. 33And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the
<br> 
<br>stranger as the home-born; half of them in front of mount Gerizim and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel. 34And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 35There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them.
<br>And it came to pass, when all the kings	that	were	beyond	the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and on all the shore of the Great Sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite,		and		the		Amorite,	the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof, 2that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with
<br>one accord.
<br>3But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 4they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine skins, worn and rent and patched up; 5and worn shoes and clouted upon their feet, and worn garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become crumbs. 6And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the
<br> 
<br>men of Israel: ‘We are come from a far country; now therefore make ye a covenant with us.’ 7And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites: ‘Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?’ 8And they said unto Joshua: ‘We are thy servants.’ And Joshua said unto them: ‘Who are ye? and from whence come ye?’ 9And they said unto him: ‘From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God; for we have heard the fame of Him, and all that He did in Egypt, 10and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. 11And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying: Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them: We are your servants; and now make ye a covenant with us. 12This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become crumbs. 13And these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent. And these our garments and our shoes are worn by reason of the very long journey.’ 14And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. 15And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the
<br> 
<br>princes of the congregation swore unto them.
<br>16And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. 17And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath- jearim. 18And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 19But all the princes said unto all the congregation: ‘We have sworn unto them by the LORD, the God of Israel; now therefore we may not touch them. 20This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.’ 21And the princes said concerning them: ‘Let them live’; so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken concerning them. 22And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying: ‘Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying: We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us? 23Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.’ 24And they answered Joshua, and said: ‘Because it was certainly told
<br> 
<br>thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. 25And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.’ 26And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 27And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, unto this day, in the place which He should choose.
<br>Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek			king		of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;	2that	they	feared		greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof		were		mighty.	3Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying: 4’Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.’ 5Therefore the five kings of the
<br> 
<br>Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it. 6And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying: ‘Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill- country are gathered together against us.’ 7So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
<br>8And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand against thee.’ 9Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night. 10And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 11And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
<br>12Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD   delivered up the Amorites before the children of
<br> 
<br>Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel:
<br>‘Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of
<br>Aijalon.’
<br>13And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,
<br>Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.
<br>Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. 14And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.
<br>15And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
<br>16And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 17And it was told Joshua, saying: ‘The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.’ 18And Joshua said: ‘Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them; 19but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.’ 20And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, 21that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace;
<br> 
<br>none whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 22Then said Joshua: ‘Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.’ 23And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon. 24And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him: ‘Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.’ And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. 25And Joshua said unto them: ‘Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.’ 26And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. 27And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.
<br>28And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof; he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, he left none
<br> 
<br>remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
<br>29And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 30And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
<br>31And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it. 32And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
<br>33Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
<br>34And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it. 35And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
<br>36And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it. 37And they
<br> 
<br>took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
<br>38And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it. 39And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.
<br>40So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the Lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining; but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded. 41And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 42And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. 43And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
<br>And it came to pass, when Jabin   king   of   Hazor   heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 2and to the kings that were on the north, in the
<br> 
<br>hill-country and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the Lowland, and in the regions of Dor on the west, 3to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 4And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 5And all these kings met together, and they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
<br>6And the LORD said unto Joshua: ‘Be not afraid because of them; for to- morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.’ 7So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them. 8And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. 9And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him; he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
<br>10And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those
<br> 
<br>kingdoms. 11And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed; and he burnt Hazor with fire. 12And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. 13But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only—that did Joshua burn. 14And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed. 15As the LORD commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua; and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>16So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the Lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the Lowland of the same; 17from the bare mountain, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon; and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death. 18Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 19There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in
<br> 
<br>battle. 20For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>21And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill- country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill- country of Judah, and from all the hill- country	of	Israel;	Joshua	utterly destroyed		them	with	their		cities. 22There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. 23So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD spoke unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
<br>Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
<br>Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: 2Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon; 3and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to
<br> 
<br>Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah; 4and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 5and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, even unto the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 6Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<br>7And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the bare mountain, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; 8in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
<br>9the king of Jericho, one;
<br>the king of Ai, which is beside Beth- el, one;
<br>10the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 11the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12the king of Eglon, one;
<br>the king of Gezer, one;
<br> 
<br>13the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 14the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 15the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
<br>16the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one; 17the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 18the king of Aphek, one;
<br>the king of the Sharon, one; 19the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
<br>20the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
<br>21the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 22the king of Kedesh, one;
<br>the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
<br>23the king of Dor in the region of Dor, one;
<br>the king of Goiim in the Gilgal, one;
<br>24the king of Tirzah, one. All the kings thirty and one.
<br>Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and the LORD
<br>said unto him: ‘Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. 2This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; 3from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward—which is counted to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the
<br> 
<br>Avvim 4on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Zidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; 5and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath; 6all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Zidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel; only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. 7Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.’ 8With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; 9from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the table-land from Medeba unto Dibon; 10and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 11and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 12all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei—the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim— for these did Moses smite, and drove them out. 13Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites; but
<br> 
<br>Geshur and Maacath dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day. 14Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of the LORD, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as He spoke unto him.
<br>15And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families. 16And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the table-land by Medeba; 17Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the table-land; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth- baal-meon; 18and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath; 19and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zerethshahar in the mount of the valley; 20and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth; 21and all the cities of the table-land, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land. 22Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain. 23And as for the border of the children of Reuben, the Jordan was their border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
<br>24And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad,
<br> 
<br>according to their families. 25And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah; 26and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Lidbir; 27and in the valley, Beth- haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan being the border thereof, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. 28This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
<br>29And Moses gave inheritance unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families. 30And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities; 31and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.
<br>32These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward. 33But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He spoke unto them.
<br> 
<br>And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel
<br>took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them, 2by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.— 3For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 4For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the open land about them for their cattle and for their substance.— 5As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
<br>6Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him: ‘Thou knowest the thing that the LORD spoke unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea. 7Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him back word as it was in my heart. 8Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed the LORD my God. 9And Moses swore on that day, saying: Surely the land
<br> 
<br>whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. 10And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as He spoke, these forty and five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness; and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. 11As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me; as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in. 12Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified; it may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the LORD spoke.’ 13And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 14Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. 15Now the name of Hebron beforetime was aKiriath-arba, which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
<br>And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to
<br>their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin
<br>
<br>a That is, The city of Arba.
<br> 
<br>southward, at the uttermost part of the south. 2And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked southward. 3And it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka. 4And it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the Brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea; this shall be your south border. 5And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. 6And the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth- arabah; and the border went up to the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 7And the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the brook; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel. 8And the border went up by the Valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward—the same is Jerusalem—and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward. 9And the border was drawn from the
<br> 
<br>top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah—the same is Kiriath-jearim. 10And the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north—the same is Chesalon—and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah. 11And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 12And as for the west border, the Great Sea was the border thereof. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
<br>13And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak—the same is Hebron. 14And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 15And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir—now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. 16And Caleb said: ‘He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.’ 17And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
<br> 
<br>18And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her: ‘What wouldest thou?’ 19And she said: ‘Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the aSouthland, give me therefore springs of water.’ And he gave her the Upper Springs and the Nether Springs.
<br>20This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
<br>21And the cities at the uttermost part of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur; 22and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah; 23and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan; 24Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth; 25and Hazor, and Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron—the same is Hazor; 26Amam, and Shema, and Moladah; 27and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-pelet; 28and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah; 29Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem; 30and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah; 31and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah; 32and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon; all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages.
<br>33In the Lowland: Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah; 34and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam;
<br>
<br>a Heb. Land of Negeb, that is, a dry land.
<br> 
<br>35Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah; 36and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, with Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
<br>37Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal- gad; 38and Dilan, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel; 39Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon; 40and Cabbon, and Lahmas, and Chithlish; 41and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
<br>42Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan; 43and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib; 44and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
<br>45Ekron, with its towns and its villages; 46from Ekron even unto the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
<br>47Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the Brook of Egypt, the Great Sea being the border thereof.
<br>48And in the hill-country: Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh; 49and Dannah, and	Kiriath-sannah—the	same	is Debir; 50and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim; 51and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages. 52Arab, and Rumah, and Eshan; 53and Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah; 54and Humtah, and Kiriath- arba—the same is Hebron, and Zior;
<br>nine cities with their villages.
<br>55Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah; 56and Jezreel, and Jokdeam,
<br> 
<br>and Zanoah; 57Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
<br>58Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor; 59and
<br>Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
<br>60Kiriath-baal—the same is Kiriath- jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
<br>61In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah; 62and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
<br>63And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem, unto this day.
<br>And the lot for the children of Joseph   went   out   from   the
<br>Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to the wilderness, even to Beth-el. 2And it went out from Beth-el-luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth. 3And it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth- horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. 4And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. 5And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus; even the border of their inheritance eastward was Atroth- addar, unto Beth-horon the upper. 6And the border went out westward, Mich-methath being on the north; and
<br> 
<br>the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah. 7And it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan. 8From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families; 9together with the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 10And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim, unto this day, and became servants to do taskwork.
<br>
<br>And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was
<br>the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 2And the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. 3But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir,
<br> 
<br>the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying: ‘The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren’; therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 5And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; 6because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons; and the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
<br>7And the border of Manasseh was, beginning from Asher, Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.— 8The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.— 9And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook, by cities which belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh; but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and the goings out thereof were at the sea: 10southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his
