<br>§5213. Considerations
<br>
<br>In exercising the authorities granted in this chapter, the Secretary shall take into consideration—
<br>
<br>(1) protecting the interests of taxpayers by maximizing overall returns and minimizing the impact on the national debt;
<br>
<br>(2) providing stability and preventing disruption to financial markets in order to limit the impact on the economy and protect American jobs, savings, and retirement security;
<br>
<br>(3) the need to help families keep their homes and to stabilize communities;
<br>
<br>(4) in determining whether to engage in a direct purchase from an individual financial institution, the long-term viability of the financial institution in determining whether the purchase represents the most efficient use of funds under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(5) ensuring that all financial institutions are eligible to participate in the program, without discrimination based on size, geography, form of organization, or the size, type, and number of assets eligible for purchase under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(6) providing financial assistance to financial institutions, including those serving low- and moderate-income populations and other underserved communities, and that have assets less than $1,000,000,000, that were well or adequately capitalized as of June 30, 2008, and that as a result of the devaluation of the preferred government-sponsored enterprises stock will drop one or more capital levels, in a manner sufficient to restore the financial institutions to at least an adequately capitalized level;
<br>
<br>(7) the need to ensure stability for United States public instrumentalities, such as counties and cities, that may have suffered significant increased costs or losses in the current market turmoil;
<br>
<br>(8) protecting the retirement security of Americans by purchasing troubled assets held by or on behalf of an eligible retirement plan described in clause (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of section 402(c)(8)(B) of title 26, except that such authority shall not extend to any compensation arrangements subject to section 409A of such title; and
<br>
<br>(9) the utility of purchasing other real estate owned and instruments backed by mortgages on multifamily properties.

In the case of a mortgage on a residential rental property, the plan required under this section shall include protecting Federal, State, and local rental subsidies and protections, and ensuring any modification takes into account the need for operating funds to maintain decent and safe conditions at the property.

Such input data shall be provided to the borrower at the time of such denial.
<br>(b) Web-based site for NPV calculator and application
<br>(1) NPV calculator
<br>
<br>In carrying out the Home Affordable Modification Program, the Secretary shall establish and maintain a site on the World Wide Web that provides a calculator for net present value analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use to enter information regarding their own mortgages and that provides a determination after entering such information regarding a mortgage of whether such mortgage would be accepted or rejected for modification under the Program, using such methodology.
<br>(2) Disclosure
<br>
<br>Such Web site shall also prominently disclose that each mortgage servicer participating in such Program may use a method for calculating net present value of a mortgage that is different than the method used by such calculator.
<br>(3) Application
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to include on such World Wide Web site a method for homeowners to apply for a mortgage modification under the Home Affordable Modification Program.
<br>(c) Public availability of NPV methodology, computer model, and variables
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make publicly available, including by posting on a World Wide Web site of the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary's methodology and computer model, including all formulae used in such computer model, used for calculating net present value of a mortgage that is used by the calculator established pursuant to subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(2) all non-proprietary variables used in such net present value analysis.

<br>(2) maximize the efficiency of the use of taxpayer resources by using market mechanisms, including auctions or reverse auctions, where appropriate.
<br>(c) Direct purchases
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that use of a market mechanism under subsection (b) is not feasible or appropriate, and the purposes of the chapter are best met through direct purchases from an individual financial institution, the Secretary shall pursue additional measures to ensure that prices paid for assets are reasonable and reflect the underlying value of the asset.
<br>(d) Conditions on purchase authority for warrants and debt instruments
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not purchase, or make any commitment to purchase, any troubled asset under the authority of this chapter, unless the Secretary receives from the financial institution from which such assets are to be purchased—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a financial institution, the securities of which are traded on a national securities exchange, a warrant giving the right to the Secretary to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution, or voting stock with respect to which,1 the Secretary agrees not to exercise voting power, as the Secretary determines appropriate; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of any financial institution other than one described in subparagraph (A), a warrant for common or preferred stock, or a senior debt instrument from such financial institution, as described in paragraph (2)(C).
<br>(2) Terms and conditions
<br>
<br>The terms and conditions of any warrant or senior debt instrument required under paragraph (1) shall meet the following requirements:
<br>(A) Purposes
<br>
<br>Such terms and conditions shall, at a minimum, be designed—
<br>
<br>(i) to provide for reasonable participation by the Secretary, for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity appreciation in the case of a warrant or other equity security, or a reasonable interest rate premium, in the case of a debt instrument; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to provide additional protection for the taxpayer against losses from sale of assets by the Secretary under this chapter and the administrative expenses of the TARP.
<br>(B) Authority to sell, exercise, or surrender
<br>
<br>The Secretary may sell, exercise, or surrender a warrant or any senior debt instrument received under this subsection, based on the conditions established under subparagraph (A).
<br>(C) Conversion
<br>
<br>The warrant shall provide that if, after the warrant is received by the Secretary under this subsection, the financial institution that issued the warrant is no longer listed or traded on a national securities exchange or securities association, as described in paragraph (1)(A), such warrants shall convert to senior debt, or contain appropriate protections for the Secretary to ensure that the Treasury is appropriately compensated for the value of the warrant, in an amount determined by the Secretary.
<br>(D) Protections
<br>
<br>Any warrant representing securities to be received by the Secretary under this subsection shall contain anti-dilution provisions of the type employed in capital market transactions, as determined by the Secretary. Such provisions shall protect the value of the securities from market transactions such as stock splits, stock distributions, dividends, and other distributions, mergers, and other forms of reorganization or recapitalization.
<br>(E) Exercise price
<br>
<br>The exercise price for any warrant issued pursuant to this subsection shall be set by the Secretary, in the interest of the taxpayers.
<br>(F) Sufficiency
<br>
<br>The financial institution shall guarantee to the Secretary that it has authorized shares of nonvoting stock available to fulfill its obligations under this subsection. Should the financial institution not have sufficient authorized shares, including preferred shares that may carry dividend rights equal to a multiple number of common shares, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary, accept a senior debt note in an amount, and on such terms as will compensate the Secretary with equivalent value, in the event that a sufficient shareholder vote to authorize the necessary additional shares cannot be obtained.
<br>(3) Exceptions
<br>(A) De minimis
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish de minimis exceptions to the requirements of this subsection, based on the size of the cumulative transactions of troubled assets purchased from any one financial institution for the duration of the program, at not more than $100,000,000.
<br>(B) Other exceptions
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish an exception to the requirements of this subsection and appropriate alternative requirements for any participating financial institution that is legally prohibited from issuing securities and debt instruments, so as not to allow circumvention of the requirements of this section.
