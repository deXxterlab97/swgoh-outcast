<br>If a State submits to the Attorney General an application for waiver that demonstrates and certifies to the Attorney General that—

<br>
<br>(B) the State has consulted with as many units of local government in such State, or organizations representing such units, as practicable regarding the State's calculation of expenditures under subparagraph (A), the State's application for waiver under this paragraph, and the State's proposed uses of funds.

<br>
<br>(I) one-quarter; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes in such unit of local government for the 3 most recent calendar years for which such data is available, bears to—

<br>
<br>(1) investigate the methodology used by the unit to determine the accuracy of the submitted data; and
<br>
<br>(2) if necessary, use the best available comparable data regarding the number of violent crimes or juvenile justice expenditures for the relevant years for the unit of local government.
<br>(d) Local government with allocations less than $10,000
<br>
<br>If under this section a unit of local government is allocated less than $10,000 for a payment period, the amount allotted shall be expended by the State on services to units of local government whose allotment is less than such amount in a manner consistent with this subchapter.
<br>(e) Direct grants to specially qualified units
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a State does not qualify or apply for funds reserved for allocation under subsection (a) by the application deadline established by the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall reserve not more than 75 percent of the allocation that the State would have received under subsection (a) for such fiscal year to provide grants to specially qualified units which meet the requirements for funding under section 10403 of this title.
