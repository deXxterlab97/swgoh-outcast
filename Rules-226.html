<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–272, title VII, §701(b), Oct. 20, 1998, 112 Stat. 2413, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>

<br>
<br>"(2) the principles of comity between the branches of Government apply to the handling of national security information;
<br>
<br>"(3) Congress, as a co-equal branch of Government, is empowered by the Constitution to serve as a check on the executive branch; in that capacity, it has a 'need to know' of allegations of wrongdoing within the executive branch, including allegations of wrongdoing in the Intelligence Community;
<br>
<br>"(4) no basis in law exists for requiring prior authorization of disclosures to the intelligence committees of Congress by employees of the executive branch of classified information about wrongdoing within the Intelligence Community;

<br>
<br>(b) The exercise of authority by the Secretary described in paragraph (2) 1 should not be construed as limiting the right of Congress or any committee of Congress to access any information it seeks.
<br>
<br>(c) Subject to the conditions established in subsections (a) and (b) above, in carrying out the duties and responsibilities specified in this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security may initiate, conduct, and supervise such audits and investigations in the Department of Homeland Security as the Inspector General considers appropriate.
