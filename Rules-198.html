<br>
<br>Chapter 4 of title 29, referred to in subsec. (a), refers to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, act June 2, 1920, ch. 219, 41 Stat. 735, as amended. Section 32(b)(1) of title 29, also referred to in subsec. (a) (enacted Sept. 6, 1966), did not reflect amendment of section 32(b) by Pub. L. 89–333 §2(a), Nov. 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 1282, which eliminated obsolete pars. (2) and (3) and redesignated par. (1) provisions as subsec. (b) and amended such subsection. Section 32(b) of title 29, refers to section 2(b) of act June 2, 1920, as amended. Such provisions were repealed by former section 500(a) of Pub. L. 93–112, title V, Sept. 26, 1973, 87 Stat. 390, and pursuant to former section 500(a) of Pub. L. 93–112, which also provided that references to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act in other provisions of law were to be deemed a reference to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and were covered by sections 701 et seq. and 731(a), respectively, of Title 29, Labor.

<br>§8107. Compensation schedule
<br>
<br>(a) If there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, the employee is entitled to basic compensation for the disability, as provided by the schedule in subsection (c) of this section, at the rate of 662/3 percent of his monthly pay. The basic compensation is—
<br>
<br>(1) payable regardless of whether the cause of the disability originates in a part of the body other than that member;
<br>
<br>(2) payable regardless of whether the disability also involves another impairment of the body; and
<br>
<br>(3) in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability.
<br>
<br>(b) With respect to any period after payments under subsection (a) of this section have ended, an employee is entitled to compensation as provided by—
<br>
<br>(1) section 8105 of this title if the disability is total; or
<br>
<br>(2) section 8106 of this title if the disability is partial.
<br>
<br>(c) The compensation schedule is as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) Arm lost, 312 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(2) Leg lost, 288 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(3) Hand lost, 244 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(4) Foot lost, 205 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(5) Eye lost, 160 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(6) Thumb lost, 75 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(7) First finger lost, 46 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(8) Great toe lost, 38 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(9) Second finger lost, 30 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(10) Third finger lost, 25 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(11) Toe other than great toe lost, 16 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(12) Fourth finger lost, 15 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(13) Loss of hearing—
<br>
<br>(A) complete loss of hearing of one ear, 52 weeks' compensation; or
<br>
<br>(B) complete loss of hearing of both ears, 200 weeks' compensation.
<br>
<br>(14) Compensation for loss of binocular vision or for loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye is the same as for loss of the eye.
<br>
<br>(15) Compensation for loss of more than one phalanx of a digit is the same as for loss of the entire digit. Compensation for loss of the first phalanx is one-half of the compensation for loss of the entire digit.
<br>
<br>(16) If, in the case of an arm or a leg, the member is amputated above the wrist or ankle, compensation is the same as for loss of the arm or leg, respectively.
<br>
<br>(17) Compensation for loss of use of two or more digits, or one or more phalanges of each of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, is proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned thereby.
<br>
<br>(18) Compensation for permanent total loss of use of a member is the same as for loss of the member.
<br>
<br>(19) Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss of use of the member. The degree of loss of vision or hearing under this schedule is determined without regard to correction.
<br>
<br>(20) In case of loss of use of more than one member or parts of more than one member as enumerated by this schedule, the compensation is for loss of use of each member or part thereof, and the awards run consecutively. However, when the injury affects only two or more digits of the same hand or foot, paragraph (17) of this subsection applies, and when partial bilateral loss of hearing is involved, compensation is computed on the loss as affecting both ears.
<br>
<br>(21) For serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck of a character likely to handicap an individual in securing or maintaining employment, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed $3,500 shall be awarded in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.
<br>
<br>(22) For permanent loss or loss of use of any other important external or internal organ of the body as determined by the Secretary, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed 312 weeks' compensation for each organ so determined shall be paid in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.

<br>§8109. Beneficiaries of awards unpaid at death; order of precedence
<br>
<br>(a) If an individual—
<br>
<br>(1) has sustained disability compensable under section 8107(a) of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) has filed a valid claim in his lifetime; and
<br>
<br>(3) dies from a cause other than the injury before the end of the period specified by the schedule;
<br>
<br>the compensation specified by the schedule that is unpaid at his death, whether or not accrued or due at his death, shall be paid—
<br>
<br>(A) under an award made before or after the death;
<br>
<br>(B) for the period specified by the schedule;
<br>
<br>(C) to and for the benefit of the persons then in being within the classes and proportions and on the conditions specified by this section; and
<br>
<br>(D) in the following order of precedence:
<br>
<br>(i) If there is no child, to the widow or widower.
<br>
<br>(ii) If there are both a widow or widower and a child or children, one-half to the widow or widower and one-half to the child or children.
<br>
<br>(iii) If there is no widow or widower, to the child or children.
<br>
<br>(iv) If there is no survivor in the above classes, to the parent or parents wholly or partly dependent for support on the decedent, or to other wholly dependent relatives listed by section 8133(a)(5) of this title, or to both in proportions provided by regulation.
<br>
<br>(v) If there is no survivor in the above classes and no burial allowance is payable under section 8134 of this title, an amount not exceeding that which would be expendable under section 8134 of this title if applicable shall be paid to reimburse a person equitably entitled thereto to the extent and in the proportion that he has paid the burial expenses, but a compensated insurer or other person obligated by law or contract to pay the burial expenses or a State or political subdivision or entity is deemed not equitably entitled.
<br>
<br>(b) Payments under subsection (a) of this section, except for an amount payable for a period preceding the death of the individual, are at the basic rate of compensation for permanent disability specified by section 8107(a) of this title even if at the time of death the individual was entitled to the augmented rate specified by section 8110 of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) A surviving beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), does not have a vested right to payment and must be alive to receive payment.
<br>
<br>(d) A beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), ceases to be entitled to payment on the happening of an event which would terminate his right to compensation for death under section 8133 of this title. When that entitlement ceases, compensation remaining unpaid under subsection (a) of this section is payable to the surviving beneficiary in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

<br>§8114. Computation of pay
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "overtime pay" means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of worktime, as observed by the employing establishment; and
<br>
<br>(2) "year" means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.
<br>
<br>(b) In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.
<br>
<br>(c) The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earnings. However, for so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury in which event he may be paid compensation for the days he would have worked but for the injury.
<br>
<br>(d) Average annual earnings are determined as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) If the employee worked in the employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay—
<br>
<br>(A) was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or
<br>
<br>(B) was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his daily wage for the particular employment, or the average thereof if the daily wage has fluctuated, by 300 if he was employed on the basis of a 6-day workweek, 280 if employed on the basis of a 5½-day week, and 260 if employed on the basis of a 5-day week.
<br>
<br>(2) If the employee did not work in employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment by the United States in the same or neighboring place, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in Federal employment, and of other employees of the United States in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee, or other relevant factors. However, the average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his injury.
<br>
<br>(4) If the employee served without pay or at nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply as far as practicable, but the average annual earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–15. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.
<br>
<br>(e) The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money, and premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) of this title are included as part of the pay, but account is not taken of—
<br>
<br>(1) overtime pay;
<br>
<br>(2) additional pay or allowance authorized outside the United States because of differential in cost of living or other special circumstances; or
<br>
<br>(3) bonus or premium pay for extraordinary service including bonus or pay for particularly hazardous service in time of war.

L. 90–83, §10(b), Sept. 11, 1967, 81 Stat. 223.
<br>§8115. Determination of wage-earning capacity
<br>
<br>(a) In determining compensation for partial disability, except permanent partial disability compensable under sections 8107–8109 of this title, the wage-earning capacity of an employee is determined by his actual earnings if his actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings of the employee do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity or if the employee has no actual earnings, his wage-earning capacity as appears reasonable under the circumstances is determined with due regard to—
<br>
<br>(1) the nature of his injury;
<br>
<br>(2) the degree of physical impairment;
<br>
<br>(3) his usual employment;
<br>
<br>(4) his age;
<br>
<br>(5) his qualifications for other employment;
<br>
<br>(6) the availability of suitable employment; and
<br>
<br>(7) other factors or circumstances which may affect his wage-earning capacity in his disabled condition.
<br>
<br>(b) Section 8114(d) of this title is applicable in determining the wage-earning capacity of an employee after the beginning of partial disability.

<br>§8116. Limitations on right to receive compensation
<br>
<br>(a) While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except—
<br>
<br>(1) in return for service actually performed;
<br>
<br>(2) pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;
<br>
<br>(3) other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and
<br>
<br>(4) retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.
<br>
<br>However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for good cause by the Secretary of Labor. The election when made is irrevocable, except as otherwise provided by statute.
<br>
<br>(c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.
<br>
<br>(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an individual receiving benefits for disability or death under this subchapter who is also receiving benefits under subchapter III of chapter 84 of this title or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be entitled to all such benefits, except that—
<br>
<br>(1) benefits received under section 223 of the Social Security Act (on account of disability) shall be subject to reduction on account of benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to the provisions of section 224 of the Social Security Act; and
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of benefits received on account of age or death under title II of the Social Security Act, compensation payable under this subchapter based on the Federal service of an employee shall be reduced by the amount of any such social security benefits payable that are attributable to Federal service of that employee covered by chapter 84 of this title. However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 84 of this title, or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act by virtue of service covered by chapter 84 of this title, does not affect the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.

<br>§8122. Time for making claim
<br>
<br>(a) An original claim for compensation for disability or death must be filed within 3 years after the injury or death. Compensation for disability or death, including medical care in disability cases, may not be allowed if claim is not filed within that time unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the immediate superior had actual knowledge of the injury or death within 30 days. The knowledge must be such to put the immediate superior reasonably on notice of an on-the-job injury or death; or
<br>
<br>(2) written notice of injury or death as specified in section 8119 of this title was given within 30 days.
<br>
<br>(b) In a case of latent disability, the time for filing claim does not begin to run until the employee has a compensable disability and is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, of the causal relationship of the compensable disability to his employment. In such a case, the time for giving notice of injury begins to run when the employee is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, that his condition is causally related to his employment, whether or not there is a compensable disability.
<br>
<br>(c) The timely filing of a disability claim because of injury will satisfy the time requirements for a death claim based on the same injury.
<br>
<br>(d) The time limitations in subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not—
<br>
<br>(1) begin to run against a minor until he reaches 21 years of age or has had a legal representative appointed; or
<br>
<br>(2) run against an incompetent individual while he is incompetent and has no duly appointed legal representative; or
<br>
<br>(3) run against any individual whose failure to comply is excused by the Secretary on the ground that such notice could not be given because of exceptional circumstances.

<br>
<br>(a) An employee shall submit to examination by a medical officer of the United States, or by a physician designated or approved by the Secretary of Labor, after the injury and as frequently and at the times and places as may be reasonably required. The employee may have a physician designated and paid by him present to participate in the examination. If there is disagreement between the physician making the examination for the United States and the physician of the employee, the Secretary shall appoint a third physician who shall make an examination.
<br>
<br>(b) An employee is entitled to be paid expenses incident to an examination required by the Secretary which in the opinion of the Secretary are necessary and reasonable, including transportation and loss of wages incurred in order to be examined. The expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary shall fix the fees for examinations held under this section by physicians not employed by or under contract to the United States to furnish medical services to employees. The fees, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.
<br>
<br>(d) If an employee refuses to submit to or obstructs an examination, his right to compensation under this subchapter is suspended until the refusal or obstruction stops. Compensation is not payable while a refusal or obstruction continues, and the period of the refusal or obstruction is deducted from the period for which compensation is payable to the employee.

<br>
<br>(1) considering the claim presented by the beneficiary and the report furnished by the immediate superior; and
<br>
<br>(2) completing such investigation as he considers necessary.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Before review under section 8128(a) of this title, a claimant for compensation not satisfied with a decision of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section is entitled, on request made within 30 days after the date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on his claim before a representative of the Secretary. At the hearing, the claimant is entitled to present evidence in further support of his claim. Within 30 days after the hearing ends, the Secretary shall notify the claimant in writing of his further decision and any modifications of the award he may make and of the basis of his decision.
<br>
<br>(2) In conducting the hearing, the representative of the Secretary is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, or by section 554 of this title except as provided by this subchapter, but may conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For this purpose, he shall receive such relevant evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as he determines necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "If the original claim for compensation has been made within the time specified in section 770 of this title" are omitted as surplusage. The words "an award for or against payment of compensation" are coextensive with and, for clarity and consistency with section 8124, substituted for "the award". The second sentence of former section 787 is omitted as included in the penultimate sentence of former section 793, which is carried into subsection (b). The last sentence of former section 787 is omitted as executed.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the word "official" is substituted for "officer" because of the definition of "officer" in section 2104 which excludes a member of a uniformed service.

<br>§8129. Recovery of overpayments
<br>
<br>(a) When an overpayment has been made to an individual under this subchapter because of an error of fact or law, adjustment shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor by decreasing later payments to which the individual is entitled. If the individual dies before the adjustment is completed, adjustment shall be made by decreasing later benefits payable under this subchapter with respect to the individual's death.
<br>
<br>(b) Adjustment or recovery by the United States may not be made when incorrect payment has been made to an individual who is without fault and when adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.
<br>
<br>(c) A certifying or disbursing official is not liable for an amount certified or paid by him when—
<br>
<br>(1) adjustment or recovery of the amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section; or
<br>
<br>(2) adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed before the death of all individuals against whose benefits deductions are authorized.
