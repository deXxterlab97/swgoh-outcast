<br>a That is, The field of the sharp knives.
<br> 
<br>24But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 25And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. 26Then Abner called to Joab, and said: ‘Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?’ 27And Joab said: ‘As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then only after the morning the people had gone away, every one from following his brother.’ 28So Joab blew the horn, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 29And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
<br>30And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. 31But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, even of Abner’s men—three hundred and threescore men died. 32And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
<br> 
<br>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed
<br>weaker and weaker.
<br>2And unto David were sons born in Hebron; and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 4and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 5and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
<br>6And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner showed himself strong in the house of Saul. 7Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner: ‘Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?’ 8Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said: ‘Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. 9God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the LORD hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; 10to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the
<br> 
<br>throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.’ 11And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
<br>12And Abner sent messengers to David straightway, saying: ‘Whose is the land?’ saying also: ‘Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring over all Israel unto thee.’ 13And he said: ‘Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee, that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.’ 14And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying: ‘Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.’ 15And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. 16And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him: ‘Go, return’; and he returned.
<br>17And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying: ‘In times past ye sought for David to be king over you; 18now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying: By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’ 19And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of
<br> 
<br>Benjamin. 20So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 21And Abner said unto David: ‘I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth.’ And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
<br>22And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 23When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying: ‘Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.’ 24Then Joab came to the king, and said: ‘What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 25Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.’ 26And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor-sirah; but David knew it not.
<br>27And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the groin, that he died, for the blood of
<br> 
<br>Asahel his brother. 28And afterward when David heard it, he said: ‘I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner; 29let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.’ 30So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
<br>31And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: ‘Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and wail before Abner.’ And king David followed the bier. 32And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 33And the king lamented for Abner, and said:
<br>Should Abner die as a churl dieth
<br>34Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters;
<br>As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.
<br>And all the people wept again over him. 35And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.’ 36And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; whatsoever the king did, pleased all the people. 37So all the people and all
<br> 
<br>Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 38And the king said unto his servants: ‘Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 39And I am this day weak, and just anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; the LORD reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.’
<br>
<br>And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were affrighted. 2And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,	of	the	children	of Benjamin; for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin; 3and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners
<br>there until this day.
<br>4Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
<br>5And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon. 6And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched
<br> 
<br>wheat; and they smote him in the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 7Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. 8And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king: ‘Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.’ 2009And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them: ‘As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 10when one told me, saying: Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, instead of giving a reward for his tidings. 11How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?’ 12And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
<br>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: ‘Behold, we are thy bone and
<br> 
<br>thy flesh. 2In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.’ 3So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.
<br>4David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 5In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
<br>6And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: ‘Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither’; thinking: ‘David cannot come in hither.’ 7Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 8And David said on that day: ‘Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and [taketh away] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul—.’ Wherefore they say: ‘There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.’ 9And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. 10And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
<br> 
<br>11And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. 12And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel’s sake.
<br>13And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. 14And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon; 15and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia; 16and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
<br>17And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. 18Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 19And David inquired of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?’ And the LORD said unto David: ‘Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.’ 20And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: ‘The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.’ Therefore the name of that
<br> 
<br>place was called aBaal-perazim. 21And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.
<br>22And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 23And when David inquired of the LORD, He said: ‘Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. 24And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.’ 25And David did so, as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
<br>And	David	again		gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 2And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whereupon is called the Name, even the name of the LORD of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim. 3And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill; and Uzzah	and	Ahio,		the	sons	of Abinadab, drove the new cart. 4And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark. 5And David and all the house
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a That is, The possessor of breaches.
<br> 
<br>of Israel played before the LORD with all manner of instruments made of cypress-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals.
<br>6And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled. 7And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. 8And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place was called aPerez-uzzah, unto this day 9And David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said: ‘How shall the ark of the LORD come unto me?’ 10So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 11And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
<br>12And it was told king David, saying: ‘The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God.’ And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy. 13And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a
<br>
<br>a That is, The breach of Uzzah.
<br> 
<br>fatling. 14And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. 15So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the horn.
<br>16And it was so, as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 17And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt- offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD. 18And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 19And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake. So all the people departed every one to his house.
<br>20Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said: ‘How did the king of Israel get him honour to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! ’ 21And David said unto Michal: ‘Before the LORD,
<br> 
<br>who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of the LORD, over Israel, before the LORD will I make merry. 22And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of, with them will I get me honour.’ 23And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
<br>And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies round about, 2that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: ‘See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the	ark	of	God	dwelleth	within curtains.’ 3And Nathan said to the king: ‘Go, do all that is in thy heart; for the LORD is with thee.’ 4And it came to pass the same night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying: 5’Go and tell My servant David: Thus saith the LORD: Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in? 6for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 7In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? 8Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I took thee from the
<br> 
<br>sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people, over Israel. 9And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 10And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 11even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee a house. 12When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom. 13He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 14I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 15but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 16And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.’ 17According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
<br> 
<br>18Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said: ‘Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? 19And this was yet a small thing in Thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of great men, O Lord GOD. 20And what can David say more unto Thee? for Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord GOD. 21For Thy word’s sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it. 22Therefore Thou art great, O LORD God; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 23And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, [in driving out] from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods? 24And Thou didst establish to Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever; and Thou, LORD, becamest their God. 25And now, O LORD God, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm Thou it for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. 26And let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The LORD of hosts is God over Israel; and the house
<br> 
<br>of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee. 27For Thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to Thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto Thee. 28And now, O Lord GOD, Thou alone art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; 29now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it; and through Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever.’
<br>And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued	them;	and	David	took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the
<br>Philistines.
<br>2And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. 3David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. 4And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. 5And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and
<br> 
<br>twenty thousand men. 6Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 7And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
<br>9And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 10then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him—because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi—and he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. 11These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued: 12of Aram, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 13And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. 14And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
<br> 
<br>15And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. 16And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 17and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; 18and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
<br>And David said: ‘Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul,
<br>that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?’ 2Now there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him: ‘Art thou Ziba?’ And he said: ‘Thy servant is he.’ 3And the king said: ‘Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame on his feet.’ 4And the king said unto him: ‘Where is he?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.’ 5Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 6And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself. And David said: ‘Mephibosheth! ’ And he answered: ‘Behold thy servant! ’ 7And David said unto him: ‘Fear not; for I
<br> 
<br>will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.’ 8And he bowed down, and said: ‘What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?’
<br>9Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him: ‘All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son. 10And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread continually at my table.’ Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 11Then said Ziba unto the king: ‘According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the king’s sons.’ 12Now Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. 13But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and he was lame on both his feet.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 2And David said: ‘I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me.’ So David sent by
<br> 
<br>the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 3But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord: ‘Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?’ 4So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 5When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said: ‘Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.’
<br>6And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob, and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. 7And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 8And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate; and the Arameans of Zobah, and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
<br>9Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of
<br> 
<br>Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans; 10and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of aAbishai his brother, and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. 11And he said: ‘If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the LORD do that which seemeth Him good.’ 13So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Arameans; and they fled before him. 14And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>15And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 16And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Arameans that were beyond the River; and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer at their head. 17And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 18And the Arameans fled before
<br>
<br>a Heb. Abshai.
<br> 
<br>Israel; and David slew of the Arameans seven hundred drivers of chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there. 19And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time
<br>when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.
<br>2And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. 3And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said: ‘Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?’ 4And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house. 5And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said: ‘I am with child.’
<br>6And David sent to Joab [, saying]: ‘Send me Uriah the Hittite.’ And Joab sent Uriah to David. 7And when Uriah
<br> 
<br>was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. 8And David said to Uriah: ‘Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.’ And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king. 9But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 10And when they had told David, saying: ‘Uriah went not down unto his house’, David said unto Uriah: ‘Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?’ 11And Uriah said unto David: ‘The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.’ 12And David said to Uriah: ‘Tarry here to-day also, and to- morrow I will let thee depart.’ So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 13And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk; and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
<br>14And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 15And he wrote in the letter, saying: ‘Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him,
<br> 
<br>that he may be smitten, and die.’ 16And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. 17And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 18Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 19and he charged the messenger, saying: ‘When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, 20it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee: Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 21who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say: Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’
<br>22So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for. 23And the messenger said unto David: ‘The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate. 24And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ 25Then David said unto the messenger: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto Joab: Let not this
<br> 
<br>thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth in one manner or another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it; and encourage thou him.’
<br>26And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. 27And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
<br>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto
<br>him, and said unto him: ‘There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor. 2The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; 3but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared; and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 4And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.’ 5And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan: ‘As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this deserveth to die; 6and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.’
<br> 
<br>7And Nathan said to David: ‘Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 8and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that were too little, then would I add unto thee so much more. 9Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the LORD, to do that which is evil in My sight? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten with the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to be thy wife, and him thou hast slain with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised Me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 11Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 12For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ 13And David said unto Nathan: ‘I have sinned against the LORD.’ And Nathan said unto David: ‘The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 14Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast greatly blasphemed the enemies of the LORD, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.’ 15And Nathan departed unto his house.
<br> 
<br>And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore unto David, and it was very sick. 16David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and as often as he went in, he lay all night upon the earth. 17And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. 18And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said: ‘Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice; how then shall we tell him that the child is dead, so that he do himself some harm?’ 19But when David saw that his servants whispered together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants: ‘Is the child dead?’ And they said: ‘He is dead.’ 20Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped; then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 21Then said his servants unto him: ‘What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.’ 22And he said: ‘While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said: Who knoweth whether the LORD will not be gracious to me, that the
<br> 
<br>child may live? 23But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.’
<br>24And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him; 25and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name aJedidiah, for the LORD’S sake.
<br>26Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 27And Joab sent messengers to David, and said: ‘I have fought against Rabbah, yea, I have taken the city of waters. 28Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.’ 29And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 30And he took the crown of Malcam from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. 31And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
<br>
<br>a That is, Beloved of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
<br>had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 2And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her. 3But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. 4And he said unto him: ‘Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?’ And Amnon said unto him: ‘I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.’ 5And Jonadab said unto him: ‘Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.’ 6So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: ‘Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.’
<br>7Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: ‘Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.’ 8So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and
<br> 
<br>kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 9And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: ‘Have out all men from me.’ And they went out every man from him. 10And Amnon said unto Tamar: ‘Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.’ And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 11And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: ‘Come lie with me, my sister.’ 12And she answered him: ‘Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed. 13And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.’ 14Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
<br>15Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: ‘Arise, be gone.’ 16And she said unto him: ‘Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.’ But he would not hearken unto her. 17Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: ‘Put now this woman
<br> 
<br>out from me, and bolt the door after her.’—18Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled.—And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 19And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
<br>20And Absalom her brother said unto her: ‘Hath aAmnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.’ So Tamar remained desolate in her brother, Absalom’s house. 21But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 22And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
<br>23And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep- shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 24And Absalom came to the king, and said: ‘Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.’ 25And the king said to Absalom: ‘Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.’ And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. 26Then said Absalom: ‘If not, I pray thee, let
<br>
<br>a Heb. Aminon.
<br> 
<br>my brother Amnon go with us.’ And the king said unto him: ‘Why should he go with thee?’ 27But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. 28And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: ‘Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.’ 29And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.
<br>30And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: ‘Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.’ 31Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 32And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said: ‘Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 33Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.’
<br>34But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a roundabout
<br> 
<br>way by the hill-side. 35And Jonadab said unto the king: ‘Behold, the king’s sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.’ 36And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
<br>37But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
<br>38So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 39And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
<br>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart
<br> 
<br>two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him. 7And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.’
<br>8And the king said unto the woman: ‘Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.’ 9And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king: ‘My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.’ 10And the king said: ‘Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he
<br> 
<br>was toward Absalom. 2And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her: ‘I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead; 3and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.’ So Joab put the words in her mouth.
<br>4And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, and said: ‘Help, O king.’ 5And the king said unto her: ‘What aileth thee?’ And she answered: ‘Of a truth I am a widow, my husband being dead. 6And thy handmaid had two sons, and they
<br> 
<br>shall not touch thee any more.’ 11Then said she: ‘I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.’
<br>12Then the woman said: ‘Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.’ And he said: ‘Say on.’ 13And the woman said: ‘Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. 14For we must needs die,
<br> 
<br>and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person; but let him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him. 15Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid said: I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. 16For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 17Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and the LORD thy God be with thee.’
<br>18Then the king answered and said unto the woman: ‘Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee.’ And the woman said: ‘Let my lord the king now speak.’ 19And the king said: ‘Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?’ And the woman answered and said: ‘As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; 20to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom
<br> 
<br>of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.’
<br>21And the king said unto Joab: ‘Behold now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.’ 22And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said: ‘To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of thy servant.’ 23So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24And the king said: ‘Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face.’ So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.
<br>25Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 26And when he polled his head—now it was at every year’s end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it—he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight. 27And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.
<br>28And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face. 29Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 30Therefore he said unto his servants:
<br> 
<br>‘See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.’ And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 31Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: ‘Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?’ 32And Absalom answered Joab: ‘Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still; now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.’ 33So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a
<br>chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 2And Absalom used to rise up early, and stand beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said: ‘Of what city art thou?’ And he said: ‘Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.’ 3And Absalom said unto him: ‘See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.’ 4Absalom said moreover: ‘Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! ’ 5And it was so,
<br> 
<br>that when any man came nigh to prostrate himself before him, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. 6And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
<br>7And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king: ‘I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 8For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Aram, saying: If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’ 9And the king said unto him: ‘Go in peace.’ So he arose, and went to Hebron. 10But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: ‘As soon as ye hear the sound of the horn, then ye shall say: Absalom is king in Hebron.’ 11And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not any thing. 12And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
<br>13And there came a messenger to David, saying: ‘The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.’ 14And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem: ‘Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall
<br> 
<br>escape from Absalom; make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.’ 15And the king’s servants said unto the king: ‘Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.’ 16And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house. 17And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth- merhak. 18And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
<br>19Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite: ‘Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile from thine own place. 20Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee in kindness and truth.’ 21And Ittai answered the king, and said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.’ 22And David said to Ittai: ‘Go and pass over.’ And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. 23And all the country
<br> 
<br>wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed over; and as the king passed over the brook Kidron, all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
<br>24And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God—but Abiathar went up—until all the people had done passing out of the city. 25And the king said unto Zadok: ‘Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back, and show me both it, and His habitation; 26but if He say thus: I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him.’ 27The king said also unto Zadok the priest: ‘Seest thou? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28See, I will tarry in the plains of the wilderness, until there come word from you to announce unto me.’ 29Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they abode there.
<br>30And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot; and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. 31And one told David, saying: ‘Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.’ And David said: ‘O LORD, I pray Thee, turn
<br> 
<br>the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.’ 32And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was wont to be worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head. 33And David said unto him: ‘If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto Me; 34but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom: I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. 35And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear.’ 37So Hushai David’s friend came into the city; and Absalom was at the point of coming into Jerusalem.
<br>And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the
<br>servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 2And the king said unto Ziba: ‘What meanest thou by these?’ And Ziba said: ‘The
<br> 
<br>asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.’ 3And the king said: ‘And where is thy master’s son?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.’ 4Then said the king to Ziba: ‘Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.’ And Ziba said: ‘I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.’
<br>5And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. 6And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 7And thus said Shimei when he cursed: ‘Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; 8the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.’
<br>9Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: ‘Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take
<br> 
<br>off his head.’ 10And the king said: ‘What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?’ 11And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: ‘Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. 12It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.’ 13So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 14And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
<br>15And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 16And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘Long live the king, long live the king.’ 17And Absalom said to Hushai: ‘Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?’ 18And Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. 19And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I
<br> 
<br>have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.’
<br>20Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: ‘Give your counsel what we shall do.’ 21And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: ‘Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.’ 22So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.— 23Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
<br>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom: ‘Let me now
<br>choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night; 2and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only; 3and I will bring back all the people unto thee; when all shall have returned, [save] the man whom thou seekest, all the people will be in peace.’ 4And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
<br>5Then said Absalom: ‘Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.’ 6And when Hushai was come to Absalom,
<br> 
<br>Absalom spoke unto him, saying: ‘Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.’ 7And Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.’ 8Hushai said moreover: ‘Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 9Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some place; and it will come to pass, when they fall upon them at the first, and whosoever heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom; 10then even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men. 11But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 12So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one. 13Moreover, if he withdraw himself into a city, then shall all Israel bring up ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one small stone found there.’ 14And
<br> 
<br>Absalom and all the men of Israel said: ‘The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.’—For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
<br>15Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests: ‘Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 16Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but in any wise pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.’ 17Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David; for they might not be seen to come into the city. 18But a lad saw them, and told Absalom; and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither. 19And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed groats thereon; and nothing was known. 20And Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said: ‘Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?’ And the woman said unto them: ‘They are gone over the brook of water.’ And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>21And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David: ‘Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.’ 22Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
<br>23And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 24When David was come to Mahanaim, Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25And Absalom had set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Jesraelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother. 26And Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
<br>27And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 28brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, 29and
<br> 
<br>honey, and curd, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said: ‘The people is hungry, and faint, and thirsty, in the wilderness.’
<br>And David numbered the people that were with him, and
<br>set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 2And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people: ‘I will surely go forth with you myself also.’ 3But the people said: ‘Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city.’ 4And the king said unto them: ‘What seemeth you best I will do.’ And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 5And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying: ‘Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.’ And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
<br>6So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. 7And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there
<br> 
<br>was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. 8For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
<br>9And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on. 10And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said: ‘Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.’ 11And Joab said unto the man that told him: ‘And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have had to give thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.’ 12And the man said unto Joab: ‘Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying: Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. 13Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against mine own life—and there is no matter hid from the king—then thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof.’ 14Then said Joab: ‘I may not tarry thus with thee.’ And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth. 15And ten young men
<br> 
<br>that bore Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
<br>16And Joab blew the horn, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people. 17And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones; and all Israel fled every one to his tent.—18Now Absalom in his life- time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said: ‘I have no son to keep my name in remembrance’; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument unto this day.
<br>19Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok: ‘Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.’ 20And Joab said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, forasmuch as the king’s son is dead.’ 21Then said Joab to the Cushite: ‘Go tell the king what thou hast seen.’ And the Cushite bowed down unto Joab, and ran. 22Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab: ‘But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite.’ And Joab said: ‘Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?’ 23’But come what may, [said he,] I will run.’ And he said unto him: ‘Run.’ Then Ahimaaz ran by
<br> 
<br>the way of the Plain, and overran the Cushite.
<br>24Now David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 25And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said: ‘If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.’ And he came apace, and drew near. 26And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said: ‘Behold another man running alone.’ And the king said: ‘He also bringeth tidings.’ 27And the watchman said: ‘I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.’ And the king said: ‘He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.’
<br>28And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king: ‘All is well.’ And he bowed down before the king with his face to the earth, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.’ 29And the king said: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And Ahimaaz answered: ‘When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.’ 30And the king said: ‘Turn aside, and stand here.’ And he turned aside, and stood still.
<br>31And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said: ‘Tidings for my lord the king; for the LORD hath
<br> 
<br>avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.’ 32And the king said unto the Cushite: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And the Cushite answered: ‘The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.’
<br>And	the	king	was	much moved, and   went   up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said: ‘O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom,
<br>my son, my son! ’
<br>2And it was told Joab: ‘Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.’ 3 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day: ‘The king grieveth for his son.’ 4And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 5And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice: ‘O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! ’ 6And Joab came into the house to the king, and said: ‘Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 7in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee; for this day I perceive, that if
<br> 
<br>Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 8Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants; for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.’ 9Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying: ‘Behold, the king doth sit in the gate’; and all the people came before the king.
<br>Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. 10And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: ‘The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. 11And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now, therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?’
<br>12And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying: ‘Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying: Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?—For the speech of all Israel was come to the king, to bring him to his house.—13Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; wherefore then should ye be the last to bring back the king? 14And say ye to Amasa: Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of
<br> 
<br>Joab.’ 15And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king: ‘Return thou, and all thy servants.’
<br>16So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 17And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, made haste and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 18And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him. And they rushed into the Jordan before the king. 19And the ferryboat passed to and fro to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he would go over the Jordan. 20And he said unto the king: ‘Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did iniquitously the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 21For thy servant doth know that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.’ 22But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said: ‘Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?’ 23And David said: ‘What have I to do with you, ye sons of
<br> 
<br>Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?’ 24And the king said unto Shimei: ‘Thou shalt not die.’ And the king swore unto him.
<br>25And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. 26And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him: ‘Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?’ 27And he answered: ‘My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said: I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame. 28And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 29For all my father’s house were deserving of death at the hand of my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet? or why should I cry any more unto the king?’ 30And the king said unto him: ‘Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say: Thou and Ziba divide the land.’ 31And Mephibosheth said unto the king: ‘Yea, let  him take all, forasmuch as
<br> 
<br>my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.’
<br>32And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he passed on to Jordan with the king, to bring him on the way over the Jordan. 33Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old; and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 34And the king said unto Barzillai: ‘Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.’ 35And Barzillai said unto the king: ‘How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 36I am this day fourscore years old; can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 37Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 38Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.’ 39And the king answered: ‘Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.’ 40And
<br> 
<br>all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
<br>41So the king went over to Gilgal, and aChimham went over with him; and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. 42And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king: ‘Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?’ 43And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: ‘Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath any gift been given us?’ 44And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said: ‘We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?’ And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
<br>Now there happened to be there a base fellow, whose
<br>name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the horn, and said: ‘We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel.’ 2So all the men of Israel went
<br>
<br>a Heb. Chimhan.
<br> 
<br>up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah did cleave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
<br>3And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood, with their husband alive.
<br>4Then said the king to Amasa: ‘Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.’ 5So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. 6And David said to Abishai: ‘Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom; take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.’ 7And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 8When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 9And Joab said to Amasa: ‘Is it well
<br> 
<br>with thee, my brother?’ And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 10But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand; so he smote him therewith in the groin, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
<br>And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 11And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said: ‘He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David let him follow Joab.’ 12And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 13When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<br>14And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth- maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together, and went in also after him. 15And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood in the moat; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
<br>16Then cried a wise woman out of the city: ‘Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab: Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.’ 17And he came
<br> 
<br>near unto her; and the woman said: ‘Art thou Joab?’ And he answered: ‘I am.’ Then she said unto him: ‘Hear the words of thy handmaid.’ And he answered: ‘I do hear.’ 18Then she spoke, saying: ‘They were wont to speak in old time, saying: They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; and so they ended the matter. 19We are of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel; seekest thou to destroy a city and a mother in Israel? why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?’ 20And Joab answered and said: ‘Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 21The matter is not so; but a man of the hill- country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.’ And the woman said unto Joab: ‘Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.’ 22Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the horn, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
<br>23Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; 24and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 25and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar
<br> 
<br>were priests; 26and Ira also the Jairite was chief minister unto David.
<br>And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
<br>after year; and David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said: ‘It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.’ 2And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them—now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them; and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah— 3and David said unto the Gibeonites: ‘What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?’ 4And the Gibeonites said unto him: ‘It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.’ And he said: ‘What say ye that I should do for you?’ 5And they said unto the king: ‘The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, so that we have been destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, 6let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.’ And the king said: ‘I will deliver them.’
<br>7But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that was between them, between David and
<br> 
<br>Jonathan the son of Saul. 8But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; 9and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the LORD, and they fell all seven together; and they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
<br>10And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 11And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 12And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa; 13and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 14And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they performed all that the
<br> 
<br>king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
<br>15And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines; and David waxed faint. 16And Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with new armour, thought to have slain David. 17But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying: ‘Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.’
<br>18And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. 19And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 20And there was again war at Gath, where was a champion, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 21And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. 22These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
<br> 
<br>And David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in
<br>the day that the LORD delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul; 2and he said:
<br>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
<br>3The God who is my rock, in Him I take refuge;
<br>My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;
<br>My saviour, Thou savest me from violence.
<br>4Praised, I cry, is the LORD,
<br>And I am saved from mine enemies.
<br>
<br>5For the waves of Death compassed me.
<br>The floods of aBelial assailed me. 6The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of Death confronted me. 7In my distress I called upon the
<br>LORD,
<br>Yea, I called unto my God;
<br>And out of His temple He heard my voice,
<br>And my cry did enter into His ears.
<br>8Then the earth did shake and quake,
<br>The foundations of heaven did tremble;
<br>Tey were shaken, because He was wroth.
<br>9Smoke arose up in His nostrils,
<br>And fire out of His mouth did devour;
<br>
<br>a That is, the nether-world.
<br> 
<br>Coals flamed forth from Him.
<br>10He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
<br>And thick darkness was under His feet.
<br>11And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
<br>Yea, He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
<br>12And He made darkness pavilions round about Him,
<br>Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
<br>13At the brightness before Him Coals of fire flamed forth.
<br>14The LORD thundered from heaven,
<br>And the Most High gave forth His voice.
<br>15And He sent out arrows, and scattered them;
<br>Lightning, and discomfited them.
<br>16And the channels of the sea appeared,
<br>The foundations of the world were laid bare
<br>By the rebuke of the LORD,
<br>At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
<br>
<br>17He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters; 18He delivered me from mine enemy
<br>most strong,
<br>From them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
<br>19They confronted me in the day of my calamity;
<br>But the LORD was a stay unto me.
<br> 
<br>20He brought me forth also into a large place;
<br>He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
<br>21The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
<br>According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.
<br>
<br>22For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
<br>And have not wickedly departed from my God.
<br>23For all His ordinances were before me;
<br>And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them.
<br>24And I was single-hearted toward Him,
<br>And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
<br>25Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
<br>According to my cleanness in His eyes.
<br>
<br>26With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful,
<br>With the upright man Thou dost show
<br>Thyself upright,
<br>27With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure;
<br>And with the crooked Thou dost show
<br>Thyself subtle.
<br>28And the afflicted people Thou dost save;
<br> 
<br>But Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest humble them.
<br>
<br>29For Thou art my lamp, O LORD;
<br>And the LORD doth lighten my darkness.
<br>30For by Thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I scale a wall.
<br>31As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is tried;
<br>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.
<br>
<br>32For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, save our God? 33The God who is my strong
<br>fortress,
<br>And who letteth my way go forth straight;
<br>34Who maketh my feet like hinds’,
<br>And setteth me upon my high places;
<br>35Who traineth my hands for war,
<br>So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
<br>36Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation;
<br>And Thy condescension hath made me great.
<br>37Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
<br>And my feet have not slipped.
<br>
<br>38I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;
<br>Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.
<br> 
<br>39And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise;
<br>Yea, they are fallen under my feet.
<br>40For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;
<br>Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
<br>41Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me;
<br>Yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off.
<br>42They looked, but there was none to save;
<br>Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.
<br>43Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,
<br>I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down.
<br>44Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people;
<br>Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations;
<br>A people whom I have not known serve me.
<br>45The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me;
<br>As soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
<br>46The sons of the stranger fade away,
<br>And come halting out of their close places.
<br>
<br>47The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock;
<br>And exalted be the God, my Rock of salvation;
<br> 
<br>48Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,
<br>And bringeth down peoples under me,
<br>49And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies;
<br>Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;
<br>Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
<br>50Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations,
<br>And will sing praises unto Thy name.
<br>51A tower of salvation is He to His king;
<br>And showeth mercy to His anointed,
<br>To David and to his seed, for evermore.
<br>
<br>Now these are the last words of David:
<br>The saying of David the son of Jesse,
<br>And the saying of the man raised on high,
<br>The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet singer of Israel:
<br>2The spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was upon my tongue.
<br>
<br>3The God of Israel said,
<br>The Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘Ruler over men shall be
<br>The righteous, even he that ruleth in the fear of God,
<br>4And as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
<br>A morning without clouds;
<br> 
<br>When through clear shining after rain,
<br>The tender grass springeth out of the earth.’
<br>5For is not my house established with God?
<br>For an everlasting covenant He hath made with me,
<br>Ordered in all things, and sure;
<br>For all my salvation, and all my desire,
<br>Will he not make it to grow?
<br>6But the ungodly, they are as thorns thrust away, all of them,
<br>For they cannot be taken with the hand;
<br>7But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the
<br>staff of a spear;
<br>And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.
<br>
<br>8These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb- basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite; [he lifted up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
<br>9And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they jeoparded their lives against the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away; 10he stood firm, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the sword; and the LORD
<br> 
<br>wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain.
<br>11And after him was Shammah the son of Age the Ararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. 12But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.
<br>13And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 14And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. 15And David longed, and said: ‘Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate! ’ 16And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 17And he said: ‘Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?’ therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
<br>18And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear
<br> 
<br>against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. 19He was most honourable of the three; therefore he was made their captain; howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
<br>20And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow; 21and he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 22These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. 23He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
<br>24Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 25Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite; 26Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; 27Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite; 28Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite; 29Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin; 30Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of Nahale-gaash; 31Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite; 32Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan; 33Shammah the
<br> 
<br>Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite; 34Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite; 35Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite; 36Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite; 37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armour-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah; 38Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; 39Uriah the Hittite. Thirty and seven in all.
<br>And again the anger of the LORD      was   kindled   against
<br>Israel, and He moved David against them, saying: ‘Go, number Israel and Judah.’ 2And the king said to Joab the captain of the host that was with him: ‘Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.’ 3And Joab said unto the king: ‘Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?’ 4Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 5And they passed over the Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer; 6then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they
<br> 
<br>came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Zidon, 7and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba. 8So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 9And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
<br>10And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD: ‘I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, O LORD, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.’ 11And when David rose up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying: 12’Go and speak unto David: Thus saith the LORD: I lay upon thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.’ 13So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him: ‘Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent Me.’ 14And David said unto Gad: ‘I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the
<br> 
<br>hand of the LORD; for His mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.’
<br>15So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 16And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people: ‘It is enough; now stay thy hand.’ And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said: ‘Lo, I have sinned, and I have done iniquitously; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.’
<br>18And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him: ‘Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing- floor of Araunah the Jebusite.’ 19And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the LORD commanded. 20And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on
<br> 
<br>toward him; and Araunah went out, and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 21And Araunah said: ‘Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?’ And David said: ‘To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.’ 22And Araunah said unto David: ‘Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him; behold the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-instruments and the furniture of the oxen for the wood.’ 23All this did Araunah the king give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king: ‘The LORD thy God accept thee.’ 24And the king said unto Araunah: ‘Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD my God which cost me nothing.’ So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 25And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

<br> 
<br>Now King David was old and stricken		in	years;	and	they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat. 2Wherefore his servants said unto him: ‘Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and be a companion unto him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.’ 3So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel,	and		found		Abishag	the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4And the damsel was very fair; and she became a companion unto the king, and ministered to him; but the
<br>king knew her not.
<br>5Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: ‘I will be king’; and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 6And his father had not grieved him all his life in saying: ‘Why hast thou done so?’ and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom. 7And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they following Adonijah helped him. 8But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 9And Adonijah slew sheep
<br> 
<br>and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants; 10but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
<br>11Then Nathan spoke unto Bath- sheba the mother of Solomon, saying: ‘Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? 12Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 13Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 14Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.’
<br>15And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber.—Now the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.—16And Bath-sheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king. And the king said: ‘What wouldest thou?’ 17And she said unto him: ‘My lord,
<br> 
<br>thou didst swear by the LORD thy God unto thy handmaid: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 18And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not. 19And he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 20And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 21Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.’
<br>22And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 23And they told the king, saying: ‘Behold Nathan the prophet.’ And when he was come in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 24And Nathan said: ‘My lord, O king, hast thou said: Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 25For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say: Long live king Adonijah. 26But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son
<br> 
<br>of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon hath he not called. 27Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?’
<br>28Then king David answered and said: ‘Call me Bath-sheba.’ And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king. 29And the king swore and said: ‘As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 30verily as I swore unto thee by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.’ 31Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and prostrated herself to the king, and said: ‘Let my lord king David live for ever.’ 32And king David said: ‘Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.’ And they came before the king. 33And the king said unto them: ‘Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 34And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the horn, and say: Long live king Solomon. 35Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.’ 36And Benaiah the son of
<br> 
<br>Jehoiada answered the king, and said: ‘Amen; so say the LORD, the God of my lord the king. 37As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.’
<br>38So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 39And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the ram’s horn; and all the people said: ‘Long live king Solomon.’ 40And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
<br>41And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said: ‘Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?’ 42While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said: ‘Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.’ 43And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah: ‘Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 44And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and
<br> 
<br>they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule. 45And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that ye have heard. 46And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 47And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying: God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king bowed down upon the bed. 48And also thus said the king: Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.’
<br>49And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 50And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 51And it was told Solomon, saying: ‘Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear unto me first of all that he will not slay his servant with the sword.’ 52And Solomon said: ‘If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.’ 53So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him: ‘Go to thy house.’
<br> 
<br>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying: 2’I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; 3and keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself; 4that the LORD may establish His word which		He		spoke	concerning	me, saying: If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said He, a   man   on		the   throne   of	Israel. 5Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were		on		his	feet.		6Do	therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 7But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they drew nigh unto me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. 8And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son	of		Gera,		the		Benjamite,		of
<br> 
<br>Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying: I will not put thee to death with the sword. 9Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood.’
<br>10And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 11And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 12And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established firmly.
<br>13Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’ And he said: ‘Peaceably.’ 14He said moreover: ‘I have somewhat to say unto thee.’ And she said: ‘Say on.’ 15And he said: ‘Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from the LORD. 16And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.’ And she said unto him: ‘Say on.’ 17And he said: ‘Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king—for he will not say thee nay—that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.’
<br> 
<br>18And Bath-sheba said: ‘Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.’
<br>19Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed down unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. 20Then she said: ‘I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not.’ And the king said unto her: ‘Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.’ 21And she said: ‘Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.’ 22And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother: ‘And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.’ 23Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 24Now therefore as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.’ 25And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.
<br>26And unto Abiathar the priest said the king: ‘Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art deserving of death; but I will not at this time put
<br> 
<br>thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.’ 27So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that the word of the LORD might be fulfilled, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<br>28And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 29And it was told king Solomon: ‘Joab is fled unto the Tent of the LORD, and, behold, he is by the altar.’ Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: ‘Go, fall upon him.’ 30And Benaiah came to the Tent of the LORD, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the king: Come forth.’ And he said: ‘Nay; but I will die here.’ And Benaiah brought back word unto the king, saying: ‘Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.’ 31And the king said unto him: ‘Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. 32And the LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 33So shall
<br> 
<br>their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.’ 34Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 35And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
<br>36And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 37For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.’ 38And Shimei said unto the king: ‘The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.’ And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<br>39And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying: ‘Behold, thy servants are in Gath.’ 40And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 41And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come back. 42And the king sent and called for Shimei, and
<br> 
<br>said unto him: ‘Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and forewarned thee, saying: Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me: The saying is good; I have heard it. 43Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?’ 44The king said moreover to Shimei: ‘Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father; therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. 45But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.’ 46So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died.
<br>And the kingdom was established in the	hand	of	Solomon.	1And Solomon	became	allied		to Pharaoh king of Egypt by marriage, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 2Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days. 3And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father; only he sacrificed
<br>and offered in the high places.
<br> 
<br>4And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 5In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said: ‘Ask what I shall give thee.’ 6And Solomon said: ‘Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great kindness, according as he walked before Thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 7And now, O LORD my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in. 8And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 9Give Thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?’ 10And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. 11And God said unto him: ‘Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice; 12behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and
<br> 
<br>an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 13And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour—so that there hath not been any among the kings like unto thee—all thy days. 14And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.’ 15And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
<br>16Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. 17And the one woman said: ‘Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 18And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 19And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlay it. 20And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 21And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked well at it in the morning,
<br> 
<br>behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.’ 22And the other woman said: ‘Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.’ And this said: ‘No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.’ Thus they spoke before the king.
<br>23Then said the king: ‘The one saith: This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith: Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.’ 24And the king said: ‘Fetch me a sword.’ And they brought a sword before the king. 25And the king said: ‘Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.’ 26Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned upon her son, and she said: ‘Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.’ But the other said: ‘It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.’ 27Then the king answered and said: ‘Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.’ 28And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
<br>And king Solomon was king over all Israel. 2And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 3Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 4and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and	Abiathar	were	priests;	5and
<br> 
<br>Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister and the king’s friend; 6and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy.
<br>7And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. 8And these are their names: The son of Hur, in the hill- country of Ephraim; 9the son of Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth- shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 10the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher; 11the son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife; 12Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; 13the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars; 14Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 15Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife; 16Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 17Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 18Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 19Geber the son of Uri, in
<br> 
<br>the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and one officer that was [over all the officers] in the land. 20Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border	of	Egypt;	they	brought presents, and served Solomon all the
<br>days of his life.
<br>2And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; 3ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. 4For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him. 2And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
<br>6And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 2And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. 8Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.
<br> 
<br>9And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. 10And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 11For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. 12And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. 13And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 14And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
<br>15And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 16And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: 17‘Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of my feet. 18But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. 19And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto
<br> 
<br>David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name. 20Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.’
<br>21And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.’ 22And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: ‘I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress. 23My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.’ 24So aHiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire. 25And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 26And
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hirom, and in verse 32.
<br> 
<br>the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
<br>27And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 28And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy. 29And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; 30besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. 31And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone. 32And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
<br>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
<br>the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 2And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 3And the
<br> 
<br>porch before the atemple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. 4And for the house he made windows broad within, and narrow without. 5And against the wall of the house he built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of bthe sanctuary; and he made side-chambers round about; 6the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.— 7For the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.— 8The door for the clowest row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row, and out of the middle into the third. 9So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered in the house with planks of cedar over beams. 10And he built the stories of the side- structure against all the house, each
<br>
<br>a That is, the holy place.
<br>b Heb. debir, that is, the hindmost or innermost room, the most holy place.
<br>c Heb. middle.
<br> 
<br>five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
<br>11And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying: 12’As for this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute Mine ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father; 13in that I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.’
<br>14So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. 16And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists; he even built them for himself within, for a Sanctuary, even for the most holy place. 17And the house, that is, the temple before [the Sanctuary], was forty cubits long. 18And the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen. 19And he prepared the Sanctuary in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 20And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, he set an altar,
<br> 
<br>which he covered with cedar. 21So Solomon overlaid athe house within with pure gold; and he drew chains of gold across the wall before the Sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold. 22And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished; also the whole altar that belonged to the Sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
<br>23And in the Sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high. 24And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. 25And the other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. 26The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 27And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 28And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
<br>29And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without. 30And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 31And for the
<br>
<br>a That is, the Sanctuary.
<br> 
<br>entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame having five angles. 32And as for the two doors of olive- wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees. 33So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square; 34and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 35And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. 36And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.
<br>37In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Ziv. 38And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
<br>
<br>And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
<br>finished all his house.
<br>2For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof
<br> 
<br>thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 3And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row. 4And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three ranks. 5And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks.
<br>6And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them.
<br>7And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
<br>8And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
<br>9All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court. 10And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 11And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood. 12And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of
<br> 
<br>cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the court of the porch of the house.
<br>13And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 14He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
<br>15Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about; [and so] the other pillar. 16And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 17He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. 18And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital. 19And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits. 20And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon each capital. 21And he set up the pillars
<br> 
<br>at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. 22And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished.
<br>23And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 24And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about; the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 25It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. 26And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.
<br>27And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. 28And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays; 29and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above; and beneath the
<br> 
<br>lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. 30And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each. 31And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings; and their borders were foursquare, not round. 32And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 33And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten. 34And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base itself. 35And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of one piece therewith. 36And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about. 37After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.
<br>38And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and
<br> 
<br>every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 39And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
<br>40And aHiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins.
<br>So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the LORD: 41the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 42and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; 43and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; 44and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; 45and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the LORD, were of burnished brass. 46In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out. 48And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hirom.
<br> 
<br>golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold; 49and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 50and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold.
<br>51Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
<br>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
<br>of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. 2And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 3And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 4And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 5And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel,  that were
<br> 
<br>assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 6And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. 7For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 8And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day. 9There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt. 10And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 11so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
<br>12Then spoke Solomon:
<br>The LORD hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
<br>13I have surely built Thee a house of habitation,
<br>A place for Thee to dwell in for ever.
<br>14And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of
<br> 
<br>Israel stood. 15And he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hand fulfilled it, saying: 16Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel. 17Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 18But the LORD said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart; 19nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name. 20And the LORD hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 21And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.’
<br>22And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; 23and he said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy
<br> 
<br>servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; 24who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day. 25Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me. 26Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou didst speak unto Thy servant David my father.
<br>27But will God in very truth dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house that I have builded! 28Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day; 29that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said: My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place. 30And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place; and when Thou hearest, forgive.
<br> 
<br>31If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; 32then hear Thou in heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
<br>33When Thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, when they do sin against Thee, if they turn again to Thee, and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house; 34then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers.
<br>35When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they do sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; 36then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.
<br>37If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; 38what prayer and supplication soever be
<br> 
<br>made by any man of all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house; 39then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest—for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men— 40that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers.
<br>41Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for Thy name’s sake— 42for they shall hear of Thy great name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm—when he shall come and pray toward this house; 43hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built.
<br>44If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the LORD toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; 45then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 46If they sin against Thee—for there is no man that
<br> 
<br>sinneth not—and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; 47yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn back, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying: We have sinned, and have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly; 48if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto Thee toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; 49then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling- place, and maintain their cause; 50and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; 51for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron; 52that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto Thee. 53For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine
<br> 
<br>inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.’
<br>54And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. 55And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: 56’Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there hath not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant. 57The LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us; 58that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His statutes, and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. 59And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that He maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, as every day shall require; 60that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD, He is God; there is none else. 61Let your heart therefore be whole with the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.’ 62And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
<br> 
<br>LORD. 63And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 64The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt- offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
<br>65So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. 66On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown unto David His servant, and to Israel His people.
<br>And it came to pass, when Solomon	had	finished	the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s delight which he was pleased to do, 2that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. 3And the LORD said unto him: ‘I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before Me: I have hallowed this
<br> 
<br>house, which thou hast built, to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. 4And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; 5then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 6But if ye shall turn away from following Me, ye or your children, and not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 7then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples; 8and this house which is so high [shall become desolate], and every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and when they shall say: Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 9they shall be answered: Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath the LORD brought all this evil upon them.’
<br> 
<br>10And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house—11now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress- trees, and with gold, according to all his desire—that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 12And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him: and they pleased him not. 13And he said: ‘What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?’ And they were called the land of Cabul, unto this day. 14And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 15And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 16Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 17And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 18and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 19and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 20All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
<br> 
<br>the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; 21even their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. 22But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
<br>23These were the chief officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
<br>24But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her; then did he build Millo.
<br>25And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house. 26And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 27And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 28And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
<br>And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
<br> 
<br>because of the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 2And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold very much, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. 3And Solomon told her all her questions; there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not. 4And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 5and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her. 6And she said to the king: ‘It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. 7Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me; thou hast wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which I heard. 8Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 9Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made He thee king, to do justice and righteousness.’ 10And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones; there
<br> 
<br>came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 11And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of sandal-wood and precious stones. 12And the king made of the sandal-wood pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers; there came no such sandal- wood, nor was seen, unto this day. 13And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
<br>14Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 15beside that which came of the merchants, and of the traffic of the traders, and of all the kings of the mingled people and of the governors of the country. 16And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 17And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold: three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<br>18Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. 19There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were arms on either side by the place of the
<br> 
<br>seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 20And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.
<br>21And all king Solomon’s drinking- vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 22For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<br>23So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 24And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 25And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<br>26And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 27And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. 28And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keveh, the king’s merchants buying
<br> 
<br>them of the men of Keveh at a price. 29And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means.
<br>Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, besides
<br>the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 2of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel: ‘Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods’; Solomon did cleave unto these in love. 3And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. 4For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not whole with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 5For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites. 6And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father. 7Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestation of the children of Ammon. 8And so did he for
<br> 
<br>all his foreign wives, who offered and sacrificed unto their gods.
<br>9And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, 10and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. 11Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon: ‘Forasmuch as this hath been in thy mind, and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. 12Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 13Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son; for David My servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.’
<br>14And the LORD raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom. 15For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom—16for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom— 17that aHadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet
<br>
<br>a Heb. Adad.
<br> 
<br>a little child. 18And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 19And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 20And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh. 21And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: ‘Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.’ 22Then Pharaoh said unto him: ‘But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?’ And he answered: ‘Nothing; howbeit let me depart in any wise.’
<br>23And God raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. 24And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 25And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Aram.
<br> 
<br>26And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. 27And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father. 28And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph. 29And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. 30And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. 31And he said to Jeroboam: ‘Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee— 32but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel— 33because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his
<br> 
<br>father. 34Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David My servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My statutes; 35but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. 36And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David My servant may have a lamp alway before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen Me to put My name there. 37And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 38And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. 39And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.’
<br>40Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
<br>41Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 42And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 43And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
<br> 
<br>David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
<br>And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were
<br>come to Shechem to make him king. 2And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it—for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt, 3and they sent and called him—that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying: 4’Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.’ 5And he said unto them: ‘Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.’ And the people departed.
<br>6And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: ‘What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?’ 7And they spoke unto him, saying: ‘If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.’ 8But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. 9And he said unto them: ‘What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make the
<br> 
<br>yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?’ 10And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. 11And now whereas my father did burden you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’
<br>12So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: ‘Come to me again the third day.’ 13And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him; 14and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: ‘My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ 15So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of the LORD, that He might establish His word, which the LORD spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 16And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: ‘What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.’ So
<br> 
<br>Israel departed unto their tents. 17But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 18Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the levy; and all Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 19So Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day. 20And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel; there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 21And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, be assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 22But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying: 23’Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying: 24Thus saith the LORD: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel; return every man to his house; for this thing is of Me.’ So they hearkened unto the word of the LORD, and returned and went their way, according to the word of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>25Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel. 26And Jeroboam said in his heart: ‘Now will the kingdom return to the house of David. 27If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn back unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.’ 28Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them: ‘Ye have gone up long enough to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ 29And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. 30And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. 31And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi. 32And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, to sacrifice unto the calves that he had made; and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made. 33And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast
<br> 
<br>for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to offer.
<br>And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by
<br>the word of the LORD unto Beth-el; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer. 2And he cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said: ‘O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that offer upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.’ 3And he gave a sign the same day saying: ‘This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.’ 4And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying: ‘Lay hold on him.’ And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to him. 5The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 6And the king answered and said unto the man of God: ‘Entreat now the favour of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me.’ And the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored him, and became as it was before. 7And the king said unto the man of God: ‘Come
<br> 
<br>home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.’ 8And the man of God said unto the king: ‘If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place. 9For it so was charged me by the word of the LORD, saying: Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.’ 10So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
<br>11Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and the words which he had spoken unto the king, and they told them unto their father. 12And their father said unto them: ‘What way went he?’ For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah. 13And he said unto his sons: ‘Saddle me the ass.’ So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon. 14And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a terebinth; and he said unto him: ‘Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?’ And he said: ‘I am.’ 15Then he said unto him: ‘Come home with me, and eat bread.’ 16And he said: ‘I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place. 17For it was said to me by the word of the LORD: Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn back to go by the way that thou camest.’ 18And he said unto him: ‘I
<br> 
<br>also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the LORD, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’—He lied unto him.—19So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
<br>20And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back. 21And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the word of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 22but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to thee: Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.’ 23And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, namely, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 24And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him; and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the carcass. 25And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
<br>26And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said: ‘It is the man of God, who
<br> 
<br>rebelled against the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke unto him.’ 27And he spoke to his sons, saying: ‘Saddle me the ass.’ And they saddled it. 28And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass; the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass. 29And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to lament, and to bury him. 30And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they made lamentation for him: ‘Alas, my brother! ’ 31And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying: ‘When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 32For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.’
<br>33After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places; whosoever would, he consecrated him, that he might be one of the priests of the high places. 34And by this thing there was sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
<br> 
<br>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam	fell	sick.	2And Jeroboam said to his wife: ‘Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh; behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people. 3And take with thee ten loaves, and biscuits, and a cruse of honey, and go to him; he will tell thee what shall become of the child.’ 4And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 5Now the LORD had said unto Ahijah: ‘Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick; thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to
<br>be another woman.’
<br>6And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said: ‘Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 7Go, tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over My people Israel, 8and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments, and who followed Me with all his
<br> 
<br>heart, to do that only which was right in Mine eyes; 9but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke Me, and hast cast Me behind thy back; 10therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man- child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone. 11Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat; for the LORD hath spoken it. 12Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house; and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 13And all Israel shall make lamentation for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave; because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. 14Moreover the LORD will raise Him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what is it even then? 15for the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will root up Israel out of this good land, which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River; because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD. 16And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath
<br> 
<br>sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.’
<br>17And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah; and as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. 18And all Israel buried him, and made lamentation for him; according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.
<br>19And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 20And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
<br>21And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and they moved Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. 23For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every leafy tree; 24and there were also sodomites in the land; they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD drove out before the children of Israel.
<br> 
<br>25And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; 26and he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 27And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. 28And it was so, that as oft as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
<br>29Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 30And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 31And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Now in the eighteenth year of king   Jeroboam   the   son   of
<br>Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah. 2Three years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 3And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not whole with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his
<br> 
<br>father. 4Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem; 5because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 6Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
<br>7And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 8And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
<br>9And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. 10And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 11And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. 12And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 13And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 14But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole with the LORD all his days.
<br> 
<br>15And he brought into the house of the LORD the things that his father had hallowed, and the things that himself had hallowed, silver, and gold, and vessels.
<br>16And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days. 17And Baasa king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 18Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, that dwelt at Damascus, saying: 19’There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.’ 20And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth- maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 21And it came to pass, when Baasa heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 22Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had builded;
<br> 
<br>and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
<br>23Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 24And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
<br>25And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 26And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 27And Baasa the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasa smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. 28Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasa slay him, and reigned in his stead. 29And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of the LORD, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Ahijah the Shilonite; 30for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin; because of his provocation wherewith
<br> 
<br>he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.
<br>31Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 32And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days.
<br>33In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasa the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty and four years. 34And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
<br>And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of
<br>Hanani against Baasa, saying: 2’Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over My people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made My people Israel to sin, to provoke Me with their sins; 3behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasa and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 4Him that dieth of Baasa in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.’
<br>5Now the rest of the acts of Baasa, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 6And Baasa slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
<br> 
<br>7And moreover by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasa, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.
<br>8In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasa to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years. 9And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him; now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah; 10and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 11And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasa; he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. 12Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasa, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasa by Jehu the prophet, 13for all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, with their vanities.
<br>14Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<br> 
<br>15In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 16And the people that were encamped heard say: ‘Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king’; wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 17And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 18And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died; 19for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
<br>20Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<br>21Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
<br>22But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 23In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years; six years reigned he in Tirzah. 24And he bought
<br> 
<br>the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria. 25And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him. 26For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, with their vanities.
<br>27Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 28And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
<br>29And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 30And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him. 31And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. 32And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 33And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke the LORD, the God of
<br> 
<br>Israel, than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
<br>34In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho; with Abiram his first- born he laid the foundation thereof, and with his youngest son Segub he set up the gates thereof; according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun.
<br>And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead,
<br>said unto Ahab: ‘As the LORD, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.’ 2And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: 3’Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. 4And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.’ 5So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. 6And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 7And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
<br>8And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: 9’Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.’ 10So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the
<br> 
<br>gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and said: ‘Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.’ 11And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said: ‘Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.’ 12And she said: ‘As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, only a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.’ 13And Elijah said unto her: ‘Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. 14For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not be spent, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the land.’ 15And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. 16The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Elijah. 17And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 18And she said unto Elijah: ‘What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?’ 19And he said unto her: ‘Give me thy son.’ And he
<br> 
<br>took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 20And he cried unto the LORD, and said: ‘O LORD my God, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?’ 21And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said: ‘O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come back into him.’ 22And the LORD hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived. 23And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said: ‘See, thy son liveth.’ 24And the woman said to Elijah: ‘Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.’
<br>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
<br>came to Elijah, in the third year, saying: ‘Go, show thyself unto Ahab, and I will send rain upon the land.’ 2And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab.
<br>And the famine was sore in Samaria. 3And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.—Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly; 4for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.— 5And Ahab said
<br> 
<br>unto Obadiah: ‘Go through the land, unto all the springs of water, and unto all the brooks; peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.’ 6So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 7And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him; and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said: ‘Is it thou, my lord Elijah?’ 8And he answered him: ‘It is I; go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here.’ 9And he said: ‘Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 10As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said: He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. 11And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here. 12And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me; but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 13Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 14And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.’ 15And
<br> 
<br>Elijah said: ‘As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.’
<br>16So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 17And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him: ‘Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?’ 18And be answered: ‘I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed the Baalim. 19Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel’s table.’
<br>20And Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 21And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said: ‘How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.’ And the people answered him not a word. 22Then said Elijah unto the people: ‘I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. 23Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. 24And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on
<br> 
<br>the name of the LORD; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.’ And all the people answered and said: ‘It is well spoken.’
<br>25And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal: ‘Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.’ 26And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying: ‘O Baal, answer us.’ But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they danced in halting wise about the altar which was made. 27And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said: ‘Cry aloud; for he is a god; either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.’ 28And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with swords and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. 29And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening offering; but their was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
<br>30And Elijah said unto all the people: ‘Come near unto me’; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was thrown down. 31And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,
<br> 
<br>saying: ‘Israel shall be thy name.’ 32And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. 33And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. 34And he said: ‘Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt- offering, and on the wood.’ And he said: ‘Do it the second time’; and they did it the second time. And he said: ‘Do it the third time’; and they did it the third time. 35And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. 36And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said: ‘O LORD, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that I have done all these things at Thy word. 37Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that Thou, LORD, art God, for Thou didst turn their heart backward.’ 38Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 39And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said: ‘The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God.’ 40And Elijah said unto them: ‘Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.’ And they took them; and Elijah brought them
<br> 
<br>down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
<br>41And Elijah said unto Ahab: ‘Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.’ 42So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees. 43And he said to his servant: ‘Go up now, look toward the sea.’ And he went up, and looked, and said: ‘There is nothing.’ And he said: ‘Go again seven times.’ 44And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said: ‘Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man’s hand.’ And he said: ‘Go up, say unto Ahab: Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.’ 45And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 46And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
<br>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal
<br>how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 2Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying: ‘So let the gods do [to me], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.’ 3And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer- sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and
<br> 
<br>left his servant there. 4But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom-tree; and he requested for himself that he might die; and said: ‘It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.’ 5And he lay down and slept under a broom-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him: ‘Arise and eat.’ 6And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. 7And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said: ‘Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.’ 8And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
<br>9And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said unto him: ‘What doest thou here, Elijah?’ 10And he said: ‘I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.’ 11And He said: ‘Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.’ And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD
<br> 
<br>was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake; 12and after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice. 13And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said: ‘What doest thou here, Elijah?’ 14And he said: ‘I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.’
<br>15And the LORD said unto him: ‘Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Aram; 16and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. 17And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. 18Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.’
<br>19So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen
<br> 
<br>before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him. 20And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said: ‘Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.’ And he said unto him: ‘Go back; for what have I done to thee?’ 21And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
<br>And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered   all   his   host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. 2And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, 3and said unto him: ‘Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also	and	thy		children,		even	the goodliest, are mine.’ 4And the king of Israel			answered		and	said:	‘It		is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.’ 5And the messengers came again, and said:		‘Thus	speaketh		Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 6but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall
<br> 
<br>be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.’
<br>7Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: ‘Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.’ 8And all the elders and all the people said unto him: ‘Hearken thou not, neither consent.’ 9Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: ‘Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.’ And the messengers departed, and brought him back word. 10And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: ‘The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.’ 11And the king of Israel answered and said: ‘Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off.’ 12And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said unto his servants: ‘Set yourselves in array.’ And they set themselves in array against the city.
<br>13And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.’
<br> 
<br>14And Ahab said: ‘By whom?’ And he said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.’ Then he said: ‘Who shall begin the battle?’ And he answered: ‘Thou.’ 15Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty- two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
<br>16And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. 17And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben- hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: ‘There are men come out from Samaria.’ 18And he said: ‘Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.’ 19So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. 20And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. 21And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter. 22And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: ‘Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.’
<br> 
<br>23And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: ‘Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. 24And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room: 25and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be	stronger		than	they.’	And	he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. 26And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 27And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country. 28And a man of God came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Because the Arameans have said: The LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.’ 29And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans	a		hundred	thousand footmen in one day. 30But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall
<br> 
<br>fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
<br>31And his servants said unto him: ‘Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.’ 32So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: ‘Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.’ And he said: ‘Is he yet alive? he is my brother.’ 33Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from him; and they said: ‘Thy brother Ben- hadad.’ Then he said: ‘Go ye, bring him.’ Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot. 34And [Ben-hadad] said unto him: ‘The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.’ ’And I , said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant.’ So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
<br>35And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the LORD: ‘Smite me, I pray thee.’ And the man refused to smite him. 36Then said he unto him: ‘Because thou hast not heartened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon
<br> 
<br>as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.’ And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew him. 37Then he found another man, and said: ‘Smite me, I pray thee.’ And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him. 38So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. 39And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: ‘Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 40And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.’ And the king of Israel said unto him: ‘So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.’ 41And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. 42And he said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.’ 43And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria.
<br>And it came to pass after these things,	that	Naboth	the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria. 2And Ahab spoke
<br> 
<br>unto Naboth, saying: ‘Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.’ 3And Naboth said to Ahab: ‘The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.’ 4And Ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said: ‘I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.’ And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 5But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him: ‘Why is thy spirit so sullen, that thou eatest no bread?’ 6And he said unto her: ‘Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him: Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it; and he answered: I will not give thee my vineyard.’ 7And Jezebel his wife said unto him: ‘Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.’ 8So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth. 9And she wrote in the letters, saying: ‘Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people; 10and set two men, base
<br> 
<br>fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying: Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he die.’
<br>11And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. 12They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. 13And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him; and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying: ‘Naboth did curse God and the king.’ Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 14Then they sent to Jezebel, saying: ‘Naboth is stoned, and is dead.’ 15And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab: ‘Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.’ 16And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
<br>17And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 18’Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
<br> 
<br>19And thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou killed, and also taken possessions? and thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith the LORD: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.’ 20And Ahab said to Elijah: ‘Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?’ And he answered: ‘I have found thee; because thou hast given thyself over to do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD. 21Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will cut off from Ahab every man- child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. 22And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked Me, and hast made Israel to sin. 23And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the moat of Jezreel. 24Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.’ 25But there was none like unto Ahab, who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. 26And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
<br>27And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his
<br> 
<br>flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softy. 28And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 29’Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me? because he humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.’
<br>And they continued three years without war between
<br>Aram and Israel. 2And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 3And the king of Israel said unto his servants: ‘Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Aram?’ 4And he said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?’ And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: ‘I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.’
<br>5And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: ‘Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.’ 6Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them: ‘Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?’ And they said: ‘Go up; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.’ 7But Jehoshaphat said: ‘Is there not here besides a prophet of the LORD, that we might inquire of him?’ 8And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.’ And Jehoshaphat said: ‘Let not the king say so.’ 9Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: ‘Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.’ 10Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing- floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 11And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.’ 12And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: ‘Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.’
<br>13And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying: ‘Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth, let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.’ 14And Micaiah said: ‘As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.’ 15And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: ‘Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?’ And he answered him: ‘Go up, and prosper; and the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.’ 16And the king said unto him: ‘How many times shall I adjure thee
<br> 
<br>that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?’ 17And he said: ‘I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said: These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.’ 18And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: ‘Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?’ 19And he said: ‘Therefore hear thou the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left. 20And the LORD said: Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead. And one said: On this manner; and another said: On that manner. 21And there came forth the spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said: I will entice him. 22And the LORD said unto him: Wherewith? And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so. 23Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.’
<br>24Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the check, and said: ‘Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?’ 25And Micaiah said: ‘Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt
<br> 
<br>go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.’ 26And the king of Israel said: ‘Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 27and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I come in peace.’ 28And Micaiah said: ‘If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.’ And he said: ‘Hear, ye peoples, all of you.’
<br>29So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 30And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.’ And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 31Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying: ‘Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.’ 32And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: ‘Surely it is the king of Israel’; and they turned aside to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out. 33And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 34And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot: ‘Turn thy hand, and carry me out of
<br> 
<br>the host; for I am sore wounded.’ 35And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Arameans, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. 36And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying: ‘Every man to his city, and every man to his country.’
<br>37So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 38And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; the harlots also washed themselves there; according unto the word of the LORD which He spoke.
<br>39Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 40So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>41And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 42Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 43And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD; 44howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high
<br> 
<br>places. 45And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
<br>46Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 47And the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. 48 And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 49 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 50Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat: ‘Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.’ But Jehoshaphat would not. 51And
<br> 
<br>Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
<br>52Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 53And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin. 54And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

<br> 
<br>AND Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
<br>2And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them: ‘Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this sickness.’ 3But an angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite: ‘Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them: Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? 4Now therefore thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.’ And Elijah departed. 5And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them: ‘Why is it that ye are returned?’ 6And they said unto him: ‘There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us: Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal- zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.’ 7And he said unto them: ‘What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?’ 8And they answered
<br> 
<br>him: ‘He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.’ And he said: ‘It is Elijah the Tishbite.’
<br>9Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him; and, behold, he sat on the top of the hill. And he spoke unto him: ‘O man of God, the king hath said: Come down.’ 10And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty: ‘If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.’ And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 11And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him: ‘O man of God, thus hath the king said: Come down quickly.’ 12And Elijah answered and said unto them: ‘If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.’ And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 13And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him: ‘O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. 14Behold,
<br> 
<br>there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight’15And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah: ‘Go down with him; be not afraid of him.’ And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. 16And he said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whether thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.’
<br>17So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 18Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<br>
<br>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 2And Elijah said unto Elisha: ‘Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me as far as Beth-el.’ And Elisha said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.’  So they went down to Beth-el.— 3And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: ‘Knowest thou that the LORD will take
<br> 
<br>away thy master from thy head to- day?’ And he said: ‘Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.’— 4And Elijah said unto him: ‘Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.’ So they came to Jericho.— 5And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him: ‘Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?’ And he answered: ‘Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.’— 6And Elijah said unto him: ‘Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to the Jordan.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.’ And they two went on.
<br>7And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan. 8And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. 9And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: ‘Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee.’ And Elisha said: ‘I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.’ 10And he said: ‘Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.’ 11And it came to pass, as they still
<br> 
<br>went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both assunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
<br>12And Elisha saw it, and he cried: ‘My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! ’ And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 13He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 14And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said: ‘Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?’ and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.
<br>15And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho some way off saw him, they said: ‘The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.’ And they came to meet him, and bowed down to the ground before him. 16And they said unto him: ‘Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.’ And he said: ‘Ye shall not send.’ 17And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said: ‘Send.’ They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. 18And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto
<br> 
<br>them: ‘Did I not say unto you: Go not?’
<br>19And the men of the city said unto Elisha: ‘Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth. 20And he said: ‘Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.’ And they brought it to him. 21And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.’ 22So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.
<br>23And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him: ‘Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.’ 24And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them. 25And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
<br>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat	king	of	Judah,	and reigned twelve years. 2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
<br> 
<br>3Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
<br>4Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams. 5But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 6And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. 7And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying: ‘The king of Moab hath rebelled against me; wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?’ And he said: ‘I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.’ 8And he said: ‘Which way shall we go up?’ And he answered: ‘The way of the wilderness of Edom.’ 9So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’journey; and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them. 10And the king of Israel said: ‘Alas! for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.’ 11But Jehoshaphat said: ‘Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?’ And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said: ‘Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.’ 12And
<br> 
<br>Jehoshaphat said: ‘The word of the LORD is with him.’ So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
<br>13And Elisha said unto the king of Israel: ‘What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.’ And the king of Israel said unto him: ‘Nay; for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.’ 14And Elisha said: ‘As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. 15But now bring me a minstrel.’ And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. 16And he said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Make this valley full of trenches. 17For thus saith the LORD: Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water; and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts. 18And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. 19And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’ 20And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of making the offering, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
<br> 
<br>21Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood on the border. 22And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water some way off as red as blood; 23and they said: ‘This is blood: the kings have surely fought together, and they have smitten each man his fellow; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.’ 24And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them. And they smote the land, even Moab, mightily. 25And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees; until there was left only Kir-hareseth with the stones of the wall thereof; so the slingers encompassed it, and smote it. 26And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not. 27Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
<br>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
<br> 
<br>prophets unto Elisha, saying: ‘Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD; and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.’ 2And Elisha said unto her: ‘What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house?’ And she said: ‘Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.’ 3Then he said: ‘Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 4And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.’ 5So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out. 6And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son: ‘Bring me yet a vessel.’ And he said unto her: ‘There is not a vessel more.’ And the oil stayed. 7Then she came and told the man of God. And he said: ‘Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.’
<br>8And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 9And she said unto her husband: ‘Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually. 10Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the roof; and let us
<br> 
<br>set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick; and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.’ 11And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber and lay there. 12And he said to Gehazi his servant: ‘Call this Shunammite.’ And when he had called her, she stood before him. 13And he said unto him: ‘Say now unto her: Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?’ And she answered: ‘I dwell among mine own people.’ 14And he said: ‘What then is to be done for her?’ And Gehazi answered: ‘Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.’ 15And he said: ‘Call her.’ And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 16And he said: ‘At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son.’ And she said: ‘Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.’ 17And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.
<br>18And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 19And he said unto his father: ‘My head, my head.’ And he said to his servant: ‘Carry him to his mother.’ 20And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. 21And she went up, and
<br> 
<br>laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. 22And she called unto her husband, and said: ‘Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come back.’ 23And he said: Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? it is neither new moon nor sabbath.’ And she said: ‘It shall be well.’ 24Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant: ‘Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.’ 25So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.
<br>And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant: ‘Behold, yonder is that Shunammite. 26Run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her: Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child?’ And she answered: ‘It is well.’ 27And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said: ‘Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her; and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told Me.’ 28Then she said: ‘Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?’ 29Then he said to Gehazi: ‘Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way; if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.’ 30And the mother of the child said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and
<br> 
<br>as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.’ And he arose, and followed her. 31And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: ‘The child is not awaked.’
<br>32And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. 33He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 34And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 35Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 36And he called Gehazi, and said: ‘Call this Shunammite.’ So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said: ‘Take up thy son.’ 37Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed down to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
<br>38And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant: ‘Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.’ 39And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
<br> 
<br>vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not. 40So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said: ‘O man of God, there is death in the pot.’ And they could not eat thereof. 41But he said: ‘Then bring meal.’ And he cast it into the pot; and he said: ‘Pour out for the people, that they may eat.’ And there was no harm in the pot.
<br>42And there came a man from Baal- shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said: ‘Give unto the people, that they may eat.’ 43And his servant said: ‘How should I set this before a hundred men?’ But he said: ‘Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith the LORD: They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.’ 44So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.
<br>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Aram, was a great
<br>man with his master, and held in esteem, because by him the LORD had given victory unto Aram; he was also a mighty man of valour, but he was a leper. 2And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife. 3And she said unto her mistress: ‘Would that my lord were with the
<br> 
<br>prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.’ 4And he went in, and told his lord, saying: ‘Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.’ 5And the king of Aram said: ‘Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.’ And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. 6And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying: ‘And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.’ 7And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said: ‘Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh an occasion against me.’
<br>8And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying: ‘Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.’ 9So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 10And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying: ‘Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come back to thee, and thou shalt be clean.’ 11But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said: ‘Behold, I thought: He will  surely come out  to
<br> 
<br>me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper. 12Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?’ So he turned, and went away in a rage. 13And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said: ‘My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee: Wash, and be clean?’ 14Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came back like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
<br>15And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said: ‘Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.’ 16But he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.’ And he urged him to take it; but he refused. 17And Naaman said: ‘If not, yet I pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules’burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. 18In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate
<br> 
<br>myself in the house of Rimmon, when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.’ 19And he said unto him: ‘Go in peace.’ So he departed from him some way.
<br>20But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said: ‘Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; as the LORD liveth, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.’ 21So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said: ‘Is all well?’ 22And he said: ‘All is well. My master hath sent me, saying: Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.’ 23And Naaman said: ‘Be content, take two talents.’ And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him. 24And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed. 25But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him: ‘Whence comest thou, Gehazi?’ And he said: ‘Thy servant went no whither.’ 26And he said unto him: ‘Went not my heart [with thee], when
<br> 
<br>the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid- servants? 27The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.’ And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
<br>And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha:   ‘Behold   now,   the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us. 2Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.’ And he answered: ‘Go ye.’ 3And one said: ‘Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.’ And he answered: ‘I will go.’ 4So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood. 5But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said: ‘Alas,	my	master!	for	it	was borrowed.’ 6And the man of God said: ‘Where fell it?’ And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim. 7And he said: ‘Take it up to thee.’ So he put out his hand, and took
<br>it.
<br>8Now the king of Aram warred against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying: ‘In such and such a place shall be my camp.’ 9And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying: ‘Beware that thou pass
<br> 
<br>not such a place; for thither the Arameans are coming down.’ 10And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he guarded himself there, not once nor twice. 11And the heart of the king of Aram was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them: ‘Will ye not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?’ 12And one of his servants said: ‘Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.’ 13And he said: ‘Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him.’ And it was told him, saying: ‘Behold, he is in Dothan.’
<br>14Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host; and they came by night, and compassed the city about. 15And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him: ‘Alas, my master! how shall we do?’ 16And he answered: ‘Fear not: for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.’ 17And Elisha prayed, and said: ‘LORD, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may see.’ And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw; and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 18And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said: ‘Smite this people, I
<br> 
<br>pray Thee, with blindness.’ And He smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 19And Elisha said unto them: ‘This is not the way, neither is this the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek.’ And he led them to Samaria.
<br>20And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said: ‘LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.’ And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. 21And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them: ‘My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?’ 22And he answered: ‘Thou shalt not smite them; hast thou taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow those whom thou wouldest smite? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.’ 23And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Aram came no more into the land of Israel.
<br>24And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 25And there was a great famine in Samaria; and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver. 26And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him,
<br> 
<br>saying: ‘Help, my lord, O king.’ 27And he said: ‘If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshingfloor, or out of the winepress?’ 28And the king said unto her: ‘What aileth thee?’ And she answered: ‘This woman said unto me: Give thy son, that we may eat him to- day, and we will eat my son to- morrow. 29So we boiled my son, and did eat him; and I said unto her on the next day: Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.’ 30And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes—now he was passing by upon the wall—and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. 31Then he said: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.’
<br>32But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him; but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders: ‘See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him; is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?’ 33And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him; and [the king] said: ‘Behold, this evil is of the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?’
<br>And Elisha said: ‘Hear ye the word of the LORD; thus saith the
<br> 
<br>LORD: To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’ 2Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said: ‘Behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might this thing be?’ And he said: ‘Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.’
<br>3Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said one to another: ‘Why sit we here until we die? 4If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.’ 5And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Arameans; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no man there. 6For the Lord had made the host of the Arameans to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host; and they said one to another: ‘Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.’ 7Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. 8And when these lepers came to the
<br> 
<br>outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
<br>9Then they said one to another: ‘We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace; if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.’ 10So they came and called unto the porters of the city; and they told them, saying.’ We came to the camp of the Arameans, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.’ 11And the porters called, and they told it to the king’s household within. 12And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants: ‘I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying: When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’ 13And one of his servants answered and said: ‘Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city— behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed—and let us send and see.’ 14They took therefore two
<br> 
<br>chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Arameans, saying: ‘Go and see.’ 15And they went after them unto the Jordan; and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Arameans had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
<br>16And the people went out, and spoiled the camp of the Arameans. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. 17And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 18And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying: ‘Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria’; 19and that captain answered the man of God, and said: ‘Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?’ and he said: ‘Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof’; 20it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.
<br>Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman,	whose	son	he	had restored to life, saying: ‘Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for the LORD  hath called for a famine; and
<br> 
<br>it shall also come upon the land seven years.’ 2And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 3And it came to pass at the seven years’end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines; and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 4Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.’ 5And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said: ‘My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.’ 6And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying: ‘Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.’
<br>7And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram was sick; and it was told him, saying.’ The man of God is come hither.’ 8And the king said unto Hazael: ‘Take a present in thy hand, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying: Shall I recover of this sickness?’ 9So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus,
<br> 
<br>forty camels’burden, and came and stood before him, and said: ‘Thy son Ben-hadad king of Aram hath sent me to thee, saying: Shall I recover of this sickness?’ 10And Elisha said unto him: ‘Go, say unto him: Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit the LORD hath shown me that he shall surely die.’ 11And he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him, until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept. 12And Hazael said: ‘Why weepeth my lord?’ And he answered: ‘Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.’ 13And Hazael said: ‘But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?’ And Elisha answered: ‘The LORD hath shown me that thou shalt be king over Aram.’ 14Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him: ‘What said Elisha to thee?’ And he answered: ‘He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.’ 15And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.
<br>16And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 17Thirty and two years old was he when he began to
<br> 
<br>reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 18And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 19Howbeit the LORD would not destroy Judah, for David His servant’s sake, as He promised him to give unto him a lamp and to his children alway.
<br>20In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 21Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents. 22Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time. 23And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 24And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>25In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 26Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 27And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
<br> 
<br>the house of Ahab; for he was the son- in-law of the house of Ahab. 28And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. 29And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
<br>
<br>And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and
<br>said unto him: ‘Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 2And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber. 3Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say: Thus saith the LORD: I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.’ 4So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 5And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said: ‘I have an errand to thee, O captain.’ And Jehu said: ‘Unto which of us all?’ And he said: ‘To thee, O captain.’ 6And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith
<br> 
<br>the LORD, the God of Israel: I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. 7And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 8For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel. 9And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah. 10And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.’ And he opened the door, and fled.
<br>11Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord; and one said unto him: ‘Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?’ And he said unto them: ‘Ye know the man and what his talk was.’ 12And they said: ‘It is false; tell us now.’ And he said: ‘Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying: Thus saith the LORD: I have anointed thee king over Israel.’ 13Then they hastened, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the horn, saying: ‘Jehu is king.’
<br>14So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.—Now Joram had been guarding Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of
<br> 
<br>Aram; 15but king aJoram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Aram.—And Jehu said: ‘If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.’ 16So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
<br>17Now the watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said: ‘I see a company.’ And Joram said: ‘Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say: Is it peace?’ 18So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said: ‘Thus saith the king: Is it peace?’ And Jehu said: ‘What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.’ And the watchman told, saying: ‘The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.’ 19Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said: ‘Thus saith the king: Is it peace?’ And Jehu answered: ‘What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.’ 20And the watchman told, saying: ‘He came even unto them, and cometh not back; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.’
<br>21And Joram said: ‘Make ready.’ And they made ready his chariot. And
<br>
<br>a Heb. Jehoram, and in verses 17, 21, 22, 23, 24.
<br> 
<br>Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 22And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said: ‘Is it peace, Jehu?’ And he answered: ‘What peace, so long as the harlotries of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?’ 23And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah: ‘There is treachery, O Ahaziah.’ 24And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 25Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar his captain: ‘Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD pronounced this burden against him: 26Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plot, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground, according to the word of the LORD.’
<br>27But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said: ‘Smite him also in the chariot’; [and they smote him] at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. 28And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him
<br> 
<br>in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
<br>29And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
<br>30And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window. 31And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said: ‘Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master’s murderer?’ 32And he lifted up his face to the window, and said: ‘Who is on my side? who?’ And there looked out to him two or three officers. 33And he said: ‘Throw her down.’ So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and she was trodden under foot. 34And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said: ‘Look now after this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.’ 35And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. 36Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said: ‘This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel; 37and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say: This is Jezebel.’
<br>Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.	And	Jehu	wrote
<br>letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the
<br> 
<br>rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up [the sons of]Ahab, saying: 2’And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and armour; 3look ye out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.’ 4But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: ‘Behold, the two kings stood not before him; how then shall we stand?’ 5And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying: ‘We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king; do thou that which is good in thine eyes.’ 6Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying: ‘If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time.’ Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up. 7And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel. 8And there came a messenger, and told him, saying: ‘They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.’ And he said: ‘Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of
<br> 
<br>the gate until the morning.’ 9And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people: ‘Ye are righteous; behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these? 10Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done that which He spoke by His servant Elijah.’ 11So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until there was left him none remaining.
<br>12And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way, 13Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said: ‘Who are ye?’ And they answered: ‘We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.’ 14And he said: ‘Take them alive.’ And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
<br>15And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him: ‘Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?’ And Jehonadab answered: ‘It is.’ ’If it be, [said Jehu,] give me thy hand.’ And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
<br> 
<br>16And he said: ‘Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD.’ So they made him ride in his chariot. 17And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke to Elijah.
<br>18And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them: ‘Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. 19Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests, let none be wanting; for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.’ But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. 20And Jehu said: ‘Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.’ And they proclaimed it. 21And Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another. 22And he said unto him that was over the vestry: ‘Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.’ And he brought them forth vestments. 23And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal: ‘Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.’ 24And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-
<br> 
<br>offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said: ‘If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, his life shall be for the life of him.’
<br>25And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt- offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains: ‘Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.’ And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 26And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them. 27And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day. 28Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 29Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan. 30And the LORD said unto Jehu: ‘Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in Mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in My heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.’ 31But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made
<br>Israel to sin.
<br>32In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short; and Hazael smote
<br> 
<br>them in all the borders of Israel: 33from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 34Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 35And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 36And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
<br>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that
<br>her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 2But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bed-chamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 3And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land.
<br>4And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds, of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son. 5And he commanded them, saying: ‘This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of
<br> 
<br>you, that come in on the sabbath, and that keep the watch of the king’s house— 6now another third part was at the gate Sur, and another third part at the gate behind the guard—shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier. 7And the other two parts of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. 8And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain; and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.’
<br>9And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 10And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spear and shields that had been king David’s, which were in the house of the LORD. 11And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. 12Then he brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown and the insignia; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said: ‘Long live the king.’
<br>13And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people,
<br> 
<br>she came to the people into the house of the LORD. 14And she looked, and, behold, the king stood on the platform, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried: ‘Treason, treason.’ 15And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them: ‘Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword’; for the priest said: ‘Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.’ 16So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’entry to the king’s house; and there was she slain.
<br>17And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people. 18And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. 19And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. 20So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet;
<br> 
<br>and they slew Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house.
<br>Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. 2In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 3And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 4Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in
<br>the high places.
<br>5And Jehoash said to the priests: ‘All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of the LORD, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of the LORD, 6let the priests take it to them, every man from him that bestoweth it upon him; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.’ 7But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 8Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them: ‘Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no longer money from them that bestow it upon you, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.’ 9And the priests consented that they should take no longer money
<br> 
<br>from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.
<br>10And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD; and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. 11And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD. 12And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, 13and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. 14But there were not made for the house of the LORD cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD; 15for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. 16Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully. 17The forfeit money, and the sin money, was not brought
<br> 
<br>into the house of the LORD; it was the priests.
<br>18Then Hazael king of Aram went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 19And Jehoash king Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem.
<br>20Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 21And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at Beth-millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla. 22 For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah,
<br>king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. 2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 3And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
<br> 
<br>and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, continually. 4And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Aram oppressed them.— 5And the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they went out from under the hand of the Arameans; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime. 6Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein; and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.— 7For there was not left to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Aram destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. 8Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 9And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
<br>10In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. 11And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein. 12Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he
<br> 
<br>did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 13And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
<br>14Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he was to die; and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said: ‘My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! ’ 15And Elisha said unto him: ‘Take bow and arrows’; and he took unto him bow and arrows. 16And he said to the king of Israel: ‘Put thy hand upon the bow’; and he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s hands. 17And he said: ‘Open the window eastward’; and he opened it. Then Elisha said: ‘Shoot’; and he shot. And he said: ‘The LORD’S arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory against Aram; for thou shalt smite the Arameans in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.’ 18And he said: ‘Take the arrows’; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel: ‘Smite upon the ground’; and he smote thrice, and stayed. 19And the man of God was wroth with him, and said: ‘Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Aram till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Aram but thrice.’ 20And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites
<br> 
<br>used to invade the land at the coming in of the year. 21And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
<br>22And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 23But the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither hath He cast them from His presence until now. 24And Hazael king of Aram died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead. 25And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben- hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
<br>In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel
<br>began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign. 2He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 3And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done. 4Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people
<br> 
<br>still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 5And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father; 6but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the LORD commanded saying: ‘The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.’ 7He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.
<br>8Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: ‘Come, let us look one another in the face.’ 9And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying: ‘The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there passed by the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle. 10Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and will thy heart lift thee up? glory therein, and remain at home; for why shouldest thou meddle with evil, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? 11But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 12And Judah was put to the
<br> 
<br>worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 13And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 14And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 15Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 16And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in
<br>his stead.
<br>17And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 18Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 19And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 20And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 21And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 22He built Elath, and
<br> 
<br>restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
<br>23In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years. 24And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. 25He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher. 26For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel. 27And the LORD said not that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
<br>28Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, for Judah in Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 29And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
<br> 
<br>began aAzariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. 2Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 3And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. 4Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. 5And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart. And Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land. 6Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 7And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
<br>8In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 9And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. 10And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 11Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah,
<br>
<br>a In verses 13, 30, &c., Uzziah.
<br> 
<br>behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 12This was the word of the LORD which He spoke unto Jehu, saying: ‘Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.’ And so it came to pass.
<br>13Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria. 14And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 15Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 16Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah; because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
<br>17In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 18And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. 19There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm
<br> 
<br>the kingdom in his hand. 20And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land. 21Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 22And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>23In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. 24And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. 25And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the king’s house, by Argob and by Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites; and he slew him, and reigned in his stead. 26Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 27In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. 28And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. 29In the days of Pekah king of Israel came
<br> 
<br>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. 30And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 31Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
<br>32In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. 33Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 34And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 35Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD. 36Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 37In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 38And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
