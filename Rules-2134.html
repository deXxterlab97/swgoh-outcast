<br>(b) Accountability criteria
<br>
<br>Within 18 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to implement this section. Such regulations shall ensure that—
<br>
<br>(1) video programming first published or exhibited after the effective date of such regulations is fully accessible through the provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection (d); and
<br>
<br>(2) video programming providers or owners maximize the accessibility of video programming first published or exhibited prior to the effective date of such regulations through the provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection (d).
<br>(c) Deadlines for captioning
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) shall include an appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed captioning of video programming once published or exhibited on television.
<br>(2) Deadlines for programming delivered using Internet protocol
<br>(A) Regulations on closed captioning on video programming delivered using Internet protocol
<br>
<br>Not later than 6 months after the submission of the report to the Commission required by subsection (e)(1) 1 of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, the Commission shall revise its regulations to require the provision of closed captioning on video programming delivered using Internet protocol that was published or exhibited on television with captions after the effective date of such regulations.
<br>(B) Schedule
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall include an appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed captioning, taking into account whether such programming is prerecorded and edited for Internet distribution, or whether such programming is live or near-live and not edited for Internet distribution.
<br>(C) Cost
<br>
<br>The Commission may delay or waive the regulation promulgated under subparagraph (A) to the extent the Commission finds that the application of the regulation to live video programming delivered using Internet protocol with captions after the effective date of such regulations would be economically burdensome to providers of video programming or program owners.
<br>(D) Requirements for regulations
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) shall contain a definition of "near-live programming" and "edited for Internet distribution";
<br>
<br>(ii) may exempt any service, class of service, program, class of program, equipment, or class of equipment for which the Commission has determined that the application of such regulations would be economically burdensome for the provider of such service, program, or equipment;
<br>
<br>(iii) shall clarify that, for the purposes of implementation, of this subsection, the terms "video programming distributors" and "video programming providers" include an entity that makes available directly to the end user video programming through a distribution method that uses Internet protocol;
<br>
<br>(iv) and describe the responsibilities of video programming providers or distributors and video programming owners;
<br>
<br>(v) shall establish a mechanism to make available to video programming providers and distributors information on video programming subject to the Act on an ongoing basis;
<br>
<br>(vi) shall consider that the video programming provider or distributor shall be deemed in compliance if such entity enables the rendering or pass through of closed captions and makes a good faith effort to identify video programming subject to the Act using the mechanism created in (v); and
<br>
<br>(vii) shall provide that de minimis failure to comply with such regulations by a video programming provider or owner shall not be treated as a violation of the regulations.
<br>(3) Alternate means of compliance
<br>
<br>An entity may meet the requirements of this section through alternate means than those prescribed by regulations pursuant to subsection (b), as revised pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, if the requirements of this section are met, as determined by the Commission.
<br>(d) Exemptions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b)—
<br>
<br>(1) the Commission may exempt by regulation programs, classes of programs, or services for which the Commission has determined that the provision of closed captioning would be economically burdensome to the provider or owner of such programming;
<br>
<br>(2) a provider of video programming or the owner of any program carried by the provider shall not be obligated to supply closed captions if such action would be inconsistent with contracts in effect on February 8, 1996, except that nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a video programming provider of its obligations to provide services required by Federal law; and
<br>
<br>(3) a provider of video programming or program owner may petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of this section, and the Commission may grant such petition upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section would be economically burdensome. During the pendency of such a petition, such provider or owner shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. The Commission shall act to grant or deny any such petition, in whole or in part, within 6 months after the Commission receives such petition, unless the Commission finds that an extension of the 6-month period is necessary to determine whether such requirements are economically burdensome.
<br>(e) Undue burden
<br>
<br>The term "undue burden" means significant difficulty or expense. In determining whether the closed captions necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph would result in an undue economic burden, the factors to be considered include—
<br>
<br>(1) the nature and cost of the closed captions for the programming;
<br>
<br>(2) the impact on the operation of the provider or program owner;
<br>
<br>(3) the financial resources of the provider or program owner; and
<br>
<br>(4) the type of operations of the provider or program owner.
<br>(f) Video description
<br>(1) Reinstatement of regulations
<br>
<br>On the day that is 1 year after October 8, 2010, the Commission shall, after a rulemaking, reinstate its video description regulations contained in the Implementation of Video Description of Video Programming Report and Order (15 F.C.C.R. 15,230 (2000)), recon. granted in part and denied in part, (16 F.C.C.R. 1251 (2001)), modified as provided in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Modifications to reinstated regulations
<br>
<br>Such regulations shall be modified only as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) The regulations shall apply to video programming, as defined in subsection (h), insofar as such programming is transmitted for display on television in digital format.
<br>
<br>(B) The Commission shall update the list of the top 25 designated market areas, the list of the top 5 national nonbroadcast networks that have at least 50 hours per quarter of prime time programming that is not exempt under this paragraph, and the beginning calendar quarter for which compliance shall be calculated.
<br>
<br>(C) The regulations may permit a provider of video programming or a program owner to petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of this section upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section be economically burdensome.
<br>
<br>(D) The Commission may exempt from the regulations established pursuant to paragraph (1) a service, class of services, program, class of programs, equipment, or class of equipment for which the Commission has determined that the application of such regulations would be economically burdensome for the provider of such service, program, or equipment.
<br>
<br>(E) The regulations shall not apply to live or near-live programming.
<br>
<br>(F) The regulations shall provide for an appropriate phased schedule of deadlines for compliance.
<br>
<br>(G) The Commission shall consider extending the exemptions and limitations in the reinstated regulations for technical capability reasons to all providers and owners of video programming.

<br>
<br>(I) if the costs of implementing the video description regulations to program owners, providers, and distributors in those additional markets are reasonable, as determined by the Commission; and
<br>
<br>(II) except that the Commission may grant waivers to entities in specific designated market areas where it deems appropriate.
<br>(g) Emergency information
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after the Advisory Committee report under subsection (e)(2) 1 is submitted to the Commission, the Commission shall complete a proceeding to—

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2010—Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 111–265, §2(1), struck out "do not" before "impede accessibility".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (e)(1)(D). Pub. L. 111–265, §2(2), substituted "facilitate" for "facilities".
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "subsection".
<br>
<br>2 So in original. Probably should be "subsections".
