<br>
<br>Prior section 556.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§395 and 396 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§273, 274, 36 Stat. 1164).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates parts of sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Similar provisions in said sections, relating to clerks, are incorporated in section 955 of this title.
<br>
<br>The revised section substitutes, as simpler and more appropriate, the prohibition against practice of law "in any court of the United States" for the more involved language of section 395 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that no clerks or marshals, deputies, or assistants within the district for which appointed "shall act as solicitor, proctor, attorney or counsel, in any cause depending in any of said courts, or in any district for which he is acting as such officer."
<br>
<br>Provisions of section 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for striking the name of an offender from the roll of attorneys and for recommendation of dismissal, were omitted as unnecessary and as covered by section 541 of this title.

The United States trustee for such region shall supervise any such individual appointed as standing trustee in the performance of the duties of standing trustee.
<br>
<br>(c) Each United States trustee shall be under the general supervision of the Attorney General, who shall provide general coordination and assistance to the United States trustees.

The Attorney General may not require that an individual be an attorney in order to qualify for appointment under subsection (b) of this section to serve as standing trustee in cases under subchapter V of chapter 11 or chapter 12 or 13 of title 11.
<br>
<br>(2) A trustee whose appointment under subsection (a)(1) or under subsection (b) is terminated or who ceases to be assigned to cases filed under title 11, United States Code, may obtain judicial review of the final agency decision by commencing an action in the district court of the United States for the district for which the panel to which the trustee is appointed under subsection (a)(1), or in the district court of the United States for the district in which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b) resides, after first exhausting all available administrative remedies, which if the trustee so elects, shall also include an administrative hearing on the record. Unless the trustee elects to have an administrative hearing on the record, the trustee shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies for purposes of this paragraph if the agency fails to make a final agency decision within 90 days after the trustee requests administrative remedies. The Attorney General shall prescribe procedures to implement this paragraph. The decision of the agency shall be affirmed by the district court unless it is unreasonable and without cause based on the administrative record before the agency.

<br>(e)(1) The Attorney General, after consultation with a United States trustee that has appointed an individual under subsection (b) of this section to serve as standing trustee in cases under subchapter V of chapter 11 or chapter 12 or 13 of title 11, shall fix—
<br>
<br>(A) a maximum annual compensation for such individual consisting of—
<br>
<br>(i) an amount not to exceed the highest annual rate of basic pay in effect for level V of the Executive Schedule; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the cash value of employment benefits comparable to the employment benefits provided by the United States to individuals who are employed by the United States at the same rate of basic pay to perform similar services during the same period of time; and
<br>
<br>(B) a percentage fee not to exceed—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a debtor who is not a family farmer, ten percent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a debtor who is a family farmer, the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) not to exceed ten percent of the payments made under the plan of such debtor, with respect to payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $450,000; and
<br>
<br>(II) three percent of payments made under the plan of such debtor, with respect to payments made after the aggregate amount of payments made under the plan exceeds $450,000;
<br>
<br>based on such maximum annual compensation and the actual, necessary expenses incurred by such individual as standing trustee.
<br>
<br>(2) Such individual shall collect such percentage fee from all payments received by such individual under plans in the cases under subchapter V of chapter 11 or chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such individual serves as standing trustee. Such individual shall pay to the United States trustee, and the United States trustee shall deposit in the United States Trustee System Fund—
<br>
<br>(A) any amount by which the actual compensation of such individual exceeds 5 per centum upon all payments received under plans in cases under subchapter V of chapter 11 or chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such individual serves as standing trustee; and
<br>
<br>(B) any amount by which the percentage for all such cases exceeds—
<br>
<br>(i) such individual's actual compensation for such cases, as adjusted under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1); plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the actual, necessary expenses incurred by such individual as standing trustee in such cases. Subject to the approval of the Attorney General, any or all of the interest earned from the deposit of payments under plans by such individual may be utilized to pay actual, necessary expenses without regard to the percentage limitation contained in subparagraph (d)(1)(B) of this section.
<br>
<br>(3) After first exhausting all available administrative remedies, an individual appointed under subsection (b) may obtain judicial review of final agency action to deny a claim of actual, necessary expenses under this subsection by commencing an action in the district court of the United States for the district where the individual resides. The decision of the agency shall be affirmed by the district court unless it is unreasonable and without cause based upon the administrative record before the agency.
<br>
<br>(4) The Attorney General shall prescribe procedures to implement this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) In the event that the services of the trustee in a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 of title 11 are terminated by dismissal or conversion of the case, or upon substantial consummation of a plan under section 1183(c)(1) of that title, the court shall award compensation to the trustee consistent with services performed by the trustee and the limits on the compensation of the trustee established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) The United States trustee for each district is authorized to contract with auditors to perform audits in cases designated by the United States trustee, in accordance with the procedures established under section 603(a) of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The report of each audit referred to in paragraph (1) shall be filed with the court and transmitted to the United States trustee. Each report shall clearly and conspicuously specify any material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets identified by the person performing the audit. In any case in which a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets has been reported, the clerk of the district court (or the clerk of the bankruptcy court if one is certified under section 156(b) of this title) shall give notice of the misstatement to the creditors in the case.
<br>
<br>(B) If a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets is reported, the United States trustee shall—
<br>
<br>(i) report the material misstatement, if appropriate, to the United States Attorney pursuant to section 3057 of title 18; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if advisable, take appropriate action, including but not limited to commencing an adversary proceeding to revoke the debtor's discharge pursuant to section 727(d) of title 11.
