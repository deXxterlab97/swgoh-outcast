<br>§1081. Coverage
<br>(a) Plans excepted from applicability of this part
<br>
<br>This part shall apply to any employee pension benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title, (and not exempted under section 1003(b) of this title), other than—
<br>
<br>(1) an employee welfare benefit plan;

<br>
<br>(3) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees;
<br>
<br>(4)(A) a plan which is established and maintained by a society, order, or association described in section 501(c)(8) or (9) of title 26, if no part of the contributions to or under such plan are made by employers of participants in such plan; or
<br>
<br>(B) a trust described in section 501(c)(18) of title 26;
<br>
<br>(5) a plan which has not at any time after September 2, 1974, provided for employer contributions;

<br>(6) an agreement providing payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest as described in section 736 of title 26;
<br>
<br>(7) an individual retirement account or annuity as described in section 408(a) of title 26, or a retirement bond described in section 409 of title 26 (as effective for obligations issued before January 1, 1984);
<br>
<br>(8) an individual account plan (other than a money purchase plan) and a defined benefit plan to the extent it is treated as an individual account plan (other than a money purchase plan) under section 1002(35)(B) of this title;

<br>(b) "Insurance contract plan" defined
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) a plan is an "insurance contract plan" if—
<br>
<br>(1) the plan is funded exclusively by the purchase of individual insurance contracts,
<br>
<br>(2) such contracts provide for level annual premium payments to be paid extending not later than the retirement age for each individual participating in the plan, and commencing with the date the individual became a participant in the plan (or, in the case of an increase in benefits, commencing at the time such increase became effective),
<br>
<br>(3) benefits provided by the plan are equal to the benefits provided under each contract at normal retirement age under the plan and are guaranteed by an insurance carrier (licensed under the laws of a State to do business with the plan) to the extent premiums have been paid,
<br>
<br>(4) premiums payable for the plan year, and all prior plan years under such contracts have been paid before lapse or there is reinstatement of the policy,
<br>
<br>(5) no rights under such contracts have been subject to a security interest at any time during the plan year, and
<br>
<br>(6) no policy loans are outstanding at any time during the plan year.
<br>
<br>A plan funded exclusively by the purchase of group insurance contracts which is determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to have the same characteristics as contracts described in the preceding sentence shall be treated as a plan described in this subsection.
<br>(c) Applicability of this part to terminated multiemployer plans
<br>
<br>This part applies, with respect to a terminated multiemployer plan to which section 1321 of this title applies, until the last day of the plan year in which the plan terminates, within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title.

<br>§1082. Minimum funding standards
<br>(a) Requirement to meet minimum funding standard
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A plan to which this part applies shall satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable to the plan for any plan year.
<br>(2) Minimum funding standard
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan shall be treated as satisfying the minimum funding standard for a plan year if—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan (other than a CSEC plan), the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which, in the aggregate, are not less than the minimum required contribution determined under section 1083 of this title for the plan for the plan year,
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a money purchase plan which is a single-employer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which are required under the terms of the plan,
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the employers make contributions to or under the plan for any plan year which, in the aggregate, are sufficient to ensure that the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency under section 1084 of this title as of the end of the plan year, and
<br>
<br>(D) in the case of a CSEC plan, the employers make contributions to or under the plan for any plan year which, in the aggregate, are sufficient to ensure that the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency under section 1085a of this title as of the end of the plan year.
<br>(b) Liability for contributions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount of any contribution required by this section (including any required installments under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1083(j) of this title or under section 1085a(f) of this title) shall be paid by the employer responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.
<br>(2) Joint and several liability where employer member of controlled group
<br>
<br>If the employer referred to in paragraph (1) is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for payment of such contributions.
<br>(3) Multiemployer plans in critical status
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a multiemployer plan for any plan year in which the plan is in critical status pursuant to section 1085 of this title. This paragraph shall only apply if the plan sponsor adopts a rehabilitation plan in accordance with section 1085(e) of this title and complies with the terms of such rehabilitation plan (and any updates or modifications of the plan).
<br>(c) Variance from minimum funding standards
<br>(1) Waiver in case of business hardship
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(i) an employer is (or in the case of a multiemployer plan or a CSEC plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are) unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan), and
<br>
<br>(ii) application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,
<br>
<br>the Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years.
<br>(B) Effects of waiver
<br>
<br>If a waiver is granted under subparagraph (A) for any plan year—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a single-employer plan (other than a CSEC plan), the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year shall be reduced by the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1083(e) of this title,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1084(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1084(b)(2)(C) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(iii) in the case of a CSEC plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1085a(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1085a(b)(2)(C) of this title.
<br>(C) Waiver of amortized portion not allowed
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may not waive under subparagraph (A) any portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) for a plan year which is attributable to any waived funding deficiency for any preceding plan year.
<br>(2) Determination of business hardship
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether or not—
<br>
<br>(A) the employer is operating at an economic loss,
<br>
<br>(B) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,
<br>
<br>(C) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and
<br>
<br>(D) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.
<br>(3) Waived funding deficiency
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the term "waived funding deficiency" means the portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) (determined without regard to the waiver) for a plan year waived by the Secretary of the Treasury and not satisfied by employer contributions.
<br>(4) Security for waivers for single-employer plans, consultations
<br>(A) Security may be required
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury may require an employer maintaining a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(15) of this title) to provide security to such plan as a condition for granting or modifying a waiver under paragraph (1) or for granting an extension under section 1085a(d) of this title.
<br>(ii) Special rules
<br>
<br>Any security provided under clause (i) may be perfected and enforced only by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or at the direction of the Corporation, by a contributing sponsor (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(13) of this title), or a member of such sponsor's controlled group (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(14) of this title).
<br>(B) Consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting or modifying a waiver under this subsection or an extension under 1085a(d) 1 of this title with respect to a plan described in subparagraph (A)(i)—
<br>
<br>(i) provide the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with—
<br>
<br>(I) notice of the completed application for any waiver, modification, or extension, and
<br>
<br>(II) an opportunity to comment on such application within 30 days after receipt of such notice, and
<br>
<br>(ii) consider—
<br>
<br>(I) any comments of the Corporation under clause (i)(II), and
<br>
<br>(II) any views of any employee organization (within the meaning of section 1002(4) of this title) representing participants in the plan which are submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with such application.
<br>
<br>Information provided to the Corporation under this subparagraph shall be considered tax return information and subject to the safeguarding and reporting requirements of section 6103(p) of title 26.
<br>(C) Exception for certain waivers or extensions
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any plan with respect to which the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the aggregate unpaid minimum required contributions for the plan year and all preceding plan years, or the accumulated funding deficiency under section 1085a of this title, whichever is applicable,
<br>
<br>(II) the present value of all waiver amortization installments determined for the plan year and succeeding plan years under section 1083(e)(2) or 1085a(b)(2)(C) of this title, whichever is applicable, and
<br>
<br>(III) the total amounts not paid by reason of an extension in effect under section 1085a(d) of this title,
<br>
<br> is less than $1,000,000.
<br>(ii) Treatment of waivers or extensions for which applications are pending
<br>
<br>The amount described in clause (i)(I) shall include any increase in such amount which would result if all applications for waivers or extensions with respect to the minimum funding standard under this subsection which are pending with respect to such plan were denied.
<br>(iii) Unpaid minimum required contribution
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph—
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>The term "unpaid minimum required contribution" means, with respect to any plan year, any minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year which is not paid on or before the due date (as determined under section 1083(j)(1) of this title) for the plan year.
<br>(II) Ordering rule
<br>
<br>For purposes of subclause (I), any payment to or under a plan for any plan year shall be allocated first to unpaid minimum required contributions for all preceding plan years on a first-in, first-out basis and then to the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year.
<br>(5) Special rules for single-employer plans
<br>(A) Application must be submitted before date 2½ months after close of year
<br>
<br>In the case of a single-employer plan, no waiver may be granted under this subsection with respect to any plan for any plan year unless an application therefor is submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury not later than the 15th day of the 3rd month beginning after the close of such plan year.
<br>(B) Special rule if employer is member of controlled group
<br>
<br>In the case of a single-employer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of paragraph (1) shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met—
<br>
<br>(i) with respect to such employer, and
<br>
<br>(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if such Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this paragraph.
<br>(6) Advance notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a waiver under this subsection, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title). Such notice shall include a description of the extent to which the plan is funded for benefits which are guaranteed under subchapter III and for benefit liabilities.
<br>(B) Consideration of relevant information
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider any relevant information provided by a person to whom notice was given under subparagraph (A).
<br>(7) Restriction on plan amendments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>No amendment of a plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under this subsection or an extension of time under section 1084(d) of this title or section 1085a(d) of this title is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in subsection (d)(2) which reduces the accrued benefit of any participant has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan). If a plan is amended in violation of the preceding sentence, any such waiver, or extension of time, shall not apply to any plan year ending on or after the date on which such amendment is adopted.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any plan amendment which—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan,
<br>
<br>(ii) only repeals an amendment described in subsection (d)(2), or
<br>
<br>(iii) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.
<br>(8) Cross reference
<br>
<br>For corresponding duties of the Secretary of the Treasury with regard to implementation of title 26, see section 412(c) of title 26.
<br>(d) Miscellaneous rules
<br>(1) Change in method or year
<br>
<br>If the funding method or a plan year for a plan is changed, the change shall take effect only if approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(2) Certain retroactive plan amendments
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, any amendment applying to a plan year which—
<br>
<br>(A) is adopted after the close of such plan year but no later than 2½ months after the close of the plan year (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, no later than 2 years after the close of such plan year),
<br>
<br>(B) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the beginning of the first plan year to which the amendment applies, and
<br>
<br>(C) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the time of adoption except to the extent required by the circumstances,
<br>
<br>shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year. No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary of the Treasury notifying him of such amendment and such Secretary has approved such amendment, or within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury unless such Secretary determines that such amendment is necessary because of a temporary substantial business hardship (as determined under subsection (c)(2)) or a substantial business hardship (as so determined) in the case of a multiemployer plan and that a waiver under subsection (c) (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan or a CSEC plan, any extension of the amortization period under section 1084(d) of this title or section 1085a(d) of this title) is unavailable or inadequate.
<br>(3) Controlled group
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "controlled group" means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of title 26.

<br>(a) Minimum required contribution
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section and section 1082(a)(2)(A) of this title, except as provided in subsection (f), the term "minimum required contribution" means, with respect to any plan year of a single-employer plan—
<br>
<br>(1) in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) is less than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year,
<br>
<br>(B) the shortfall amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year determined under subsection (c), and
<br>
<br>(C) the waiver amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year as determined under subsection (e); or
<br>
<br>(2) in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) equals or exceeds the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year reduced (but not below zero) by such excess.
<br>(b) Target normal cost
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (i)(2) with respect to plans in at-risk status, the term "target normal cost" means, for any plan year, the excess of—
<br>
<br>(A) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year, plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year, over
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year.
<br>(2) Special rule for increase in compensation
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, if any benefit attributable to services performed in a preceding plan year is increased by reason of any increase in compensation during the current plan year, the increase in such benefit shall be treated as having accrued during the current plan year.
<br>(c) Shortfall amortization charge
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization charge for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total (not less than zero) of the shortfall amortization installments for such plan year with respect to any shortfall amortization base which has not been fully amortized under this subsection.
<br>(2) Shortfall amortization installment
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)—
<br>(A) Determination
<br>
<br>The shortfall amortization installments are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level annual installments over the 7-plan-year period beginning with such plan year.
<br>(B) Shortfall installment
<br>
<br>The shortfall amortization installment for any plan year in the 7-plan-year period under subparagraph (A) with respect to any shortfall amortization base is the annual installment determined under subparagraph (A) for that year for that base.
<br>(C) Segment rates
<br>
<br>In determining any shortfall amortization installment under this paragraph, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).
<br>(D) Special election for eligible plan years
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If a plan sponsor elects to apply this subparagraph with respect to the shortfall amortization base of a plan for any eligible plan year (in this subparagraph and paragraph (7) referred to as an "election year"), then, notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B)—
<br>
<br>(I) the shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall be determined under clause (ii) or (iii), whichever is specified in the election, and
<br>
<br>(II) the shortfall amortization installment for any plan year in the 9-plan-year period described in clause (ii) or the 15-plan-year period described in clause (iii), respectively, with respect to such shortfall amortization base is the annual installment determined under the applicable clause for that year for that base.
<br>(ii) 2 plus 7 amortization schedule
<br>
<br>The shortfall amortization installments determined under this clause are—
<br>
<br>(I) in the case of the first 2 plan years in the 9-plan-year period beginning with the election year, interest on the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year (determined using the effective interest rate for the plan for the election year), and
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of the last 7 plan years in such 9-plan-year period, the amounts necessary to amortize the remaining balance of the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year in level annual installments over such last 7 plan years (using the segment rates under subparagraph (C) for the election year).
<br>(iii) 15-year amortization
<br>
<br>The shortfall amortization installments determined under this subparagraph are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year in level annual installments over the 15-plan-year period beginning with the election year (using the segment rates under subparagraph (C) for the election year).
<br>(iv) Election
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor of a plan may elect to have this subparagraph apply to not more than 2 eligible plan years with respect to the plan, except that in the case of a plan described in section 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the plan sponsor may only elect to have this subparagraph apply to a plan year beginning in 2011.
<br>(II) Amortization schedule
<br>
<br>Such election shall specify whether the amortization schedule under clause (ii) or (iii) shall apply to an election year, except that if a plan sponsor elects to have this subparagraph apply to 2 eligible plan years, the plan sponsor must elect the same schedule for both years.
<br>(III) Other rules
<br>
<br>Such election shall be made at such time, and in such form and manner, as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a revocation request, provide the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation an opportunity to comment on the conditions applicable to the treatment of any portion of the election year shortfall amortization base that remains unamortized as of the revocation date.
<br>(v) Eligible plan year
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "eligible plan year" means any plan year beginning in 2008, 2009, 2010, or 2011, except that a plan year shall only be treated as an eligible plan year if the due date under subsection (j)(1) for the payment of the minimum required contribution for such plan year occurs on or after June 25, 2010.
<br>(vi) Reporting
<br>
<br>A plan sponsor of a plan who makes an election under clause (i) shall—
<br>
<br>(I) give notice of the election to participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and
<br>
<br>(II) inform the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of such election in such form and manner as the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may prescribe.
<br>(vii) Increases in required installments in certain cases
<br>
<br>For increases in required contributions in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions, see paragraph (7).
<br>(3) Shortfall amortization base
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization base of a plan for a plan year is—
<br>
<br>(A) the funding shortfall of such plan for such plan year, minus
<br>
<br>(B) the present value (determined using the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2)) of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments which have been determined for such plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases of the plan for any plan year preceding such plan year.
<br>(4) Funding shortfall
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the funding shortfall of a plan for any plan year is the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>(A) the funding target of the plan for the plan year, over
<br>
<br>(B) the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) for the plan year which are held by the plan on the valuation date.
<br>(5) Exemption from new shortfall amortization base
<br>
<br>In any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(A)) is equal to or greater than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization base of the plan for such plan year shall be zero.
<br>(6) Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
<br>
<br>In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the shortfall amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the shortfall amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all shortfall amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.
<br>(7) Increases in alternate required installments in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If there is an installment acceleration amount with respect to a plan for any plan year in the restriction period with respect to an election year under paragraph (2)(D), then the shortfall amortization installment otherwise determined and payable under such paragraph for such plan year shall, subject to the limitation under subparagraph (B), be increased by such amount.
<br>(B) Total installments limited to shortfall base
<br>
<br>Subject to rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, if a shortfall amortization installment with respect to any shortfall amortization base for an election year is required to be increased for any plan year under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) such increase shall not result in the amount of such installment exceeding the present value of such installment and all succeeding installments with respect to such base (determined without regard to such increase but after application of clause (ii)), and
<br>
<br>(ii) subsequent shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall, in reverse order of the otherwise required installments, be reduced to the extent necessary to limit the present value of such subsequent shortfall amortization installments (after application of this paragraph) to the present value of the remaining unamortized shortfall amortization base.
<br>(C) Installment acceleration amount
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The term "installment acceleration amount" means, with respect to any plan year in a restriction period with respect to an election year, the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the aggregate amount of excess employee compensation determined under subparagraph (D) with respect to all employees for the plan year, plus
<br>
<br>(II) the aggregate amount of extraordinary dividends and redemptions determined under subparagraph (E) for the plan year.
<br>(ii) Annual limitation
<br>
<br>The installment acceleration amount for any plan year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>(I) the sum of the shortfall amortization installments for the plan year and all preceding plan years in the amortization period elected under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to the shortfall amortization base with respect to an election year, determined without regard to paragraph (2)(D) and this paragraph, over
<br>
<br>(II) the sum of the shortfall amortization installments for such plan year and all such preceding plan years, determined after application of paragraph (2)(D) (and in the case of any preceding plan year, after application of this paragraph).
<br>(iii) Carryover of excess installment acceleration amounts
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>If the installment acceleration amount for any plan year (determined without regard to clause (ii)) exceeds the limitation under clause (ii), then, subject to subclause (II), such excess shall be treated as an installment acceleration amount with respect to the succeeding plan year.
<br>(II) Cap to apply
<br>
<br>If any amount treated as an installment acceleration amount under subclause (I) or this subclause with respect 1 any succeeding plan year, when added to other installment acceleration amounts (determined without regard to clause (ii)) with respect to the plan year, exceeds the limitation under clause (ii), the portion of such amount representing such excess shall be treated as an installment acceleration amount with respect to the next succeeding plan year.
<br>(III) Limitation on years to which amounts carried for
<br>
<br>No amount shall be carried under subclause (I) or (II) to a plan year which begins after the first plan year following the last plan year in the restriction period (or after the second plan year following such last plan year in the case of an election year with respect to which 15-year amortization was elected under paragraph (2)(D)).
<br>(IV) Ordering rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying subclause (II), installment acceleration amounts for the plan year (determined without regard to any carryover under this clause) shall be applied first against the limitation under clause (ii) and then carryovers to such plan year shall be applied against such limitation on a first-in, first-out basis.
<br>(D) Excess employee compensation
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The term "excess employee compensation" means, with respect to any employee for any plan year, the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>(I) the aggregate amount includible in income under chapter 1 of title 26 for remuneration during the calendar year in which such plan year begins for services performed by the employee for the plan sponsor (whether or not performed during such calendar year), over
<br>
<br>(II) $1,000,000.
<br>(ii) Amounts set aside for nonqualified deferred compensation
<br>
<br>If during any calendar year assets are set aside or reserved (directly or indirectly) in a trust (or other arrangement as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), or transferred to such a trust or other arrangement, by a plan sponsor for purposes of paying deferred compensation of an employee under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in section 409A of such title) of the plan sponsor, then, for purposes of clause (i), the amount of such assets shall be treated as remuneration of the employee includible in income for the calendar year unless such amount is otherwise includible in income for such year. An amount to which the preceding sentence applies shall not be taken into account under this paragraph for any subsequent calendar year.
<br>(iii) Only remuneration for certain post-2009 services counted
<br>
<br>Remuneration shall be taken into account under clause (i) only to the extent attributable to services performed by the employee for the plan sponsor after February 28, 2010.

<br>(II) Secretarial authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation provide for the application of this clause in the case of a person other than a corporation.
<br>(v) Other exceptions
<br>
<br>The following amounts includible in income shall not be taken into account under clause (i)(I):
<br>(I) Commissions
<br>
<br>Any remuneration payable on a commission basis solely on account of income directly generated by the individual performance of the individual to whom such remuneration is payable.
<br>(II) Certain payments under existing contracts
<br>
<br>Any remuneration consisting of nonqualified deferred compensation, restricted stock, stock options, or stock appreciation rights payable or granted under a written binding contract that was in effect on March 1, 2010, and which was not modified in any material respect before such remuneration is paid.
<br>(vi) Self-employed individual treated as employee
<br>
<br>The term "employee" includes, with respect to a calendar year, a self-employed individual who is treated as an employee under section 401(c) of such title for the taxable year ending during such calendar year, and the term "compensation" shall include earned income of such individual with respect to such self-employment.
<br>(vii) Indexing of amount
<br>
<br>In the case of any calendar year beginning after 2010, the dollar amount under clause (i)(II) shall be increased by an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) such dollar amount, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) of such title for the calendar year, determined by substituting "calendar year 2009" for "calendar year 1992" in subparagraph (B) thereof.
<br>
<br> If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $1,000, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1,000.
<br>(E) Extraordinary dividends and redemptions
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The amount determined under this subparagraph for any plan year is the excess (if any) of the sum of the dividends declared during the plan year by the plan sponsor plus the aggregate amount paid for the redemption of stock of the plan sponsor redeemed during the plan year over the greater of—
<br>
<br>(I) the adjusted net income (within the meaning of section 1343 of this title) of the plan sponsor for the preceding plan year, determined without regard to any reduction by reason of interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a plan sponsor that determined and declared dividends in the same manner for at least 5 consecutive years immediately preceding such plan year, the aggregate amount of dividends determined and declared for such plan year using such manner.
<br>(ii) Only certain post-2009 dividends and redemptions counted

<br>
<br>Dividends and redemptions with respect to applicable preferred stock shall not be taken into account under clause (i) to the extent that dividends accrue with respect to such stock at a specified rate in all events and without regard to the plan sponsor's income, and interest accrues on any unpaid dividends with respect to such stock.
<br>(II) Applicable preferred stock
<br>
<br>For purposes of subclause (I), the term "applicable preferred stock" means preferred stock which was issued before March 1, 2010 (or which was issued after such date and is held by an employee benefit plan subject to the provisions of this subchapter).
<br>(F) Other definitions and rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—

<br>(I) except as provided in subclause (II), the 3-year period beginning with the election year (or, if later, the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2009), and
<br>
<br>(II) if the plan sponsor elects 15-year amortization for the shortfall amortization base for the election year, the 5-year period beginning with the election year (or, if later, the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2009).
<br>(iii) Elections for multiple plans
<br>
<br>If a plan sponsor makes elections under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to 2 or more plans, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide rules for the application of this paragraph to such plans, including rules for the ratable allocation of any installment acceleration amount among such plans on the basis of each plan's relative reduction in the plan's shortfall amortization installment for the first plan year in the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) (determined without regard to this paragraph).
<br>(iv) Mergers and acquisitions
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe rules for the application of paragraph (2)(D) and this paragraph in any case where there is a merger or acquisition involving a plan sponsor making the election under paragraph (2)(D).

<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(1) Funding target
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (i)(1) with respect to plans in at-risk status, the funding target of a plan for a plan year is the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year.
<br>(2) Funding target attainment percentage
<br>
<br>The "funding target attainment percentage" of a plan for a plan year is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which—
<br>
<br>(A) the value of plan assets for the plan year (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)), bears to
<br>
<br>(B) the funding target of the plan for the plan year (determined without regard to subsection (i)(1)).
<br>(e) Waiver amortization charge
<br>(1) Determination of waiver amortization charge
<br>
<br>The waiver amortization charge (if any) for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total of the waiver amortization installments for such plan year with respect to the waiver amortization bases for each of the 5 preceding plan years.
<br>(2) Waiver amortization installment
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)—
<br>(A) Determination
<br>
<br>The waiver amortization installments are the amounts necessary to amortize the waiver amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level annual installments over a period of 5 plan years beginning with the succeeding plan year.
<br>(B) Waiver installment
<br>
<br>The waiver amortization installment for any plan year in the 5-year period under subparagraph (A) with respect to any waiver amortization base is the annual installment determined under subparagraph (A) for that year for that base.
<br>(3) Interest rate
<br>
<br>In determining any waiver amortization installment under this subsection, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).
<br>(4) Waiver amortization base
<br>
<br>The waiver amortization base of a plan for a plan year is the amount of the waived funding deficiency (if any) for such plan year under section 1082(c) of this title.
<br>(5) Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
<br>
<br>In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the waiver amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the waiver amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all waiver amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.
<br>(f) Reduction of minimum required contribution by prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance
<br>(1) Election to maintain balances
<br>(A) Prefunding balance
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor of a single-employer plan may elect to maintain a prefunding balance.
<br>(B) Funding standard carryover balance
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a single-employer plan described in clause (ii), the plan sponsor may elect to maintain a funding standard carryover balance, until such balance is reduced to zero.
<br>(ii) Plans maintaining funding standard account in 2007
<br>
<br>A plan is described in this clause if the plan—
<br>
<br>(I) was in effect for a plan year beginning in 2007, and
<br>
<br>(II) had a positive balance in the funding standard account under section 1082(b) of this title as in effect for such plan year and determined as of the end of such plan year.
<br>(2) Application of balances
<br>
<br>A prefunding balance and a funding standard carryover balance maintained pursuant to this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be available for crediting against the minimum required contribution, pursuant to an election under paragraph (3),
<br>
<br>(B) shall be applied as a reduction in the amount treated as the value of plan assets for purposes of this section, to the extent provided in paragraph (4), and
<br>
<br>(C) may be reduced at any time, pursuant to an election under paragraph (5).
<br>(3) Election to apply balances against minimum required contribution
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of any plan year in which the plan sponsor elects to credit against the minimum required contribution for the current plan year all or a portion of the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance for the current plan year (not in excess of such minimum required contribution), the minimum required contribution for the plan year shall be reduced as of the first day of the plan year by the amount so credited by the plan sponsor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the minimum required contribution shall be determined after taking into account any waiver under section 1082(c) of this title.
<br>(B) Coordination with funding standard carryover balance
<br>
<br>To the extent that any plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no amount of the prefunding balance of such plan may be credited under this paragraph in reducing the minimum required contribution.
<br>(C) Limitation for underfunded plans
<br>
<br>The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply for any plan year if the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which—
<br>
<br>(i) the value of plan assets for the preceding plan year (as reduced under paragraph (4)(C)), bears to
<br>
<br>(ii) the funding target of the plan for the preceding plan year (determined without regard to subsection (i)(1)),
<br>
<br>is less than 80 percent. In the case of plan years beginning in 2008, the ratio under this subparagraph may be determined using such methods of estimation as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
<br>(D) Special rule for certain years of plans maintained by charities
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying subparagraph (C) for plan years beginning after August 31, 2009, and before September 1, 2011, the ratio determined under such subparagraph for the preceding plan year shall be the greater of—
<br>
<br>(I) such ratio, as determined without regard to this subparagraph, or
<br>
<br>(II) the ratio for such plan for the plan year beginning after August 31, 2007, and before September 1, 2008, as determined under rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall not apply to any plan unless such plan is maintained exclusively by one or more organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of title 26.
<br>(4) Effect of balances on amounts treated as value of plan assets
<br>
<br>In the case of any plan maintaining a prefunding balance or a funding standard carryover balance pursuant to this subsection, the amount treated as the value of plan assets shall be deemed to be such amount, reduced as provided in the following subparagraphs:
<br>(A) Applicability of shortfall amortization base
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (c)(5), the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance, but only if an election under paragraph (3) applying any portion of the prefunding balance in reducing the minimum required contribution is in effect for the plan year.
<br>(B) Determination of excess assets, funding shortfall, and funding target attainment percentage
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsections (a), (c)(4)(B), and (d)(2)(A), the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance.
<br>(ii) Special rule for certain binding agreements with PBGC
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (c)(4)(B), the value of plan assets shall not be deemed to be reduced for a plan year by the amount of the specified balance if, with respect to such balance, there is in effect for a plan year a binding written agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which provides that such balance is not available to reduce the minimum required contribution for the plan year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "specified balance" means the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance, as the case may be.
<br>(C) Availability of balances in plan year for crediting against minimum required contribution
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(i) of this subsection, the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance.
<br>(5) Election to reduce balance prior to determinations of value of plan assets and crediting against minimum required contribution
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor may elect to reduce by any amount the balance of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance for any plan year (but not below zero). Such reduction shall be effective prior to any determination of the value of plan assets for such plan year under this section and application of the balance in reducing the minimum required contribution for such plan for such plan year pursuant to an election under paragraph (2).2
<br>(B) Coordination between prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance
<br>
<br>To the extent that any plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no election may be made under subparagraph (A) with respect to the prefunding balance.
<br>(6) Prefunding balance
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A prefunding balance maintained by a plan shall consist of a beginning balance of zero, increased and decreased to the extent provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), and adjusted further as provided in paragraph (8).
<br>(B) Increases
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>As of the first day of each plan year beginning after 2008, the prefunding balance of a plan shall be increased by the amount elected by the plan sponsor for the plan year. Such amount shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>(I) the aggregate total of employer contributions to the plan for the preceding plan year, over—
<br>
<br>(II) the minimum required contribution for such preceding plan year.
<br>(ii) Adjustments for interest
<br>
<br>Any excess contributions under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for interest accruing for the periods between the first day of the current plan year and the dates on which the excess contributions were made, determined by using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year and by treating contributions as being first used to satisfy the minimum required contribution.
<br>(iii) Certain contributions necessary to avoid benefit limitations disregarded
<br>
<br>The excess described in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be required to make under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of section 1056(g) of this title to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year. Any contribution which may be taken into account in satisfying the requirements of more than 1 of such paragraphs shall be taken into account only once for purposes of this clause.
<br>(C) Decrease
<br>
<br>The prefunding balance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by—
<br>
<br>(i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008, the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under paragraph (5).
<br>(7) Funding standard carryover balance
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A funding standard carryover balance maintained by a plan shall consist of a beginning balance determined under subparagraph (B), decreased to the extent provided in subparagraph (C), and adjusted further as provided in paragraph (8).
<br>(B) Beginning balance
<br>
<br>The beginning balance of the funding standard carryover balance shall be the positive balance described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii)(II).
<br>(C) Decreases
<br>
<br>The funding standard carryover balance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by—
<br>
<br>(i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008, the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under paragraph (5).
<br>(8) Adjustments for investment experience
<br>
<br>In determining the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance of a plan as of the first day of the plan year, the plan sponsor shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, adjust such balance to reflect the rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year. Notwithstanding subsection (g)(3), such rate of return shall be determined on the basis of fair market value and shall properly take into account, in accordance with such regulations, all contributions, distributions, and other plan payments made during such period.
<br>(9) Elections
<br>
<br>Elections under this subsection shall be made at such times, and in such form and manner, as shall be prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(g) Valuation of plan assets and liabilities
<br>(1) Timing of determinations
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, all determinations under this section for a plan year shall be made as of the valuation date of the plan for such plan year.
<br>(2) Valuation date
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the valuation date of a plan for any plan year shall be the first day of the plan year.
<br>(B) Exception for small plans
<br>
<br>If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer participants, the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for such plan year and succeeding plan years. For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined benefit plans which are single-employer plans and are maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer's controlled group) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only participants with respect to such employer or member shall be taken into account.
<br>(C) Application of certain rules in determination of plan size
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) Plans not in existence in preceding year
<br>
<br>In the case of the first plan year of any plan, subparagraph (B) shall apply to such plan by taking into account the number of participants that the plan is reasonably expected to have on days during such first plan year.
<br>(ii) Predecessors
<br>
<br>Any reference in subparagraph (B) to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.
<br>(3) Determination of value of plan assets
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.
<br>(B) Averaging allowed
<br>
<br>A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—
<br>
<br>(i) is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
<br>
<br>(ii) does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and
<br>
<br>(iii) does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.
<br>
<br>Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan's actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third segment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(4) Accounting for contribution receipts
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the value of assets under paragraph (3)—
<br>(A) Prior year contributions
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(i) an employer makes any contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the contribution is for a preceding plan year,
<br>
<br>the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.
<br>(B) Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date
<br>
<br>If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include—
<br>
<br>(i) such contributions, and
<br>
<br>(ii) interest on such contributions for the period between the date of the contributions and the valuation date, determined by using the effective interest rate for the plan year.
<br>(h) Actuarial assumptions and methods
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to this subsection, the determination of any present value or other computation under this section shall be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—
<br>
<br>(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and
<br>
<br>(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.
<br>(2) Interest rates
<br>(A) Effective interest rate
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "effective interest rate" means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of interest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan's accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding target of the plan for such plan year.
<br>(B) Interest rates for determining funding target
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the funding target and normal cost of a plan for any plan year, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits of the plan shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 5-year period beginning on the valuation date for the plan year, the first segment rate with respect to the applicable month,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i), the second segment rate with respect to the applicable month, and
<br>
<br>(iii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable after the period described in clause (ii), the third segment rate with respect to the applicable month.
<br>(C) Segment rates
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) First segment rate
<br>
<br>The term "first segment rate" means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 5-year period commencing with such month.
<br>(ii) Second segment rate
<br>
<br>The term "second segment rate" means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i).
<br>(iii) Third segment rate
<br>
<br>The term "third segment rate" means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during periods beginning after the period described in clause (ii).
<br>(iv) Segment rate stabilization
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>If a segment rate described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) with respect to any applicable month (determined without regard to this clause) is less than the applicable minimum percentage, or more than the applicable maximum percentage, of the average of the segment rates described in such clause for years in the 25-year period ending with September 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins, then the segment rate described in such clause with respect to the applicable month shall be equal to the applicable minimum percentage or the applicable maximum percentage of such average, whichever is closest. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available.
<br>(II) Applicable minimum percentage; applicable maximum percentage
<br>
<br>For purposes of subclause (I), the applicable minimum percentage and the applicable maximum percentage for a plan year beginning in a calendar year shall be determined in accordance with the following table:
<br>If the calendar year is:	The
<br>
<br>applicable minimum percentage is:
<br>	The
<br>
<br>applicable maximum percentage is:
<br>2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, or 2020 	90% 	110%
<br>2021 	85% 	115%
<br>2022 	80% 	120%
<br>2023 	75% 	125%
<br>After 2023 	70% 	130%
<br>(D) Corporate bond yield curve
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The term "corporate bond yield curve" means, with respect to any month, a yield curve which is prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month and which reflects the average, for the 24-month period ending with the month preceding such month, of monthly yields on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and that are in the top 3 quality levels available.
<br>(ii) Election to use yield curve
<br>
<br>Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i). Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(E) Applicable month
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "applicable month" means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the month which includes the valuation date of such plan for such plan year or, at the election of the plan sponsor, any of the 4 months which precede such month. Any election made under this subparagraph shall apply to the plan year for which the election is made and all succeeding plan years, unless the election is revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(F) Publication requirements
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall publish for each month the corporate bond yield curve (and the corporate bond yield curve reflecting the modification described in section 1055(g)(3)(B)(iii)(I) 3 of this title for such month) and each of the rates determined under subparagraph (C) and the averages determined under subparagraph (C)(iv) for such month. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also publish a description of the methodology used to determine such yield curve and such rates which is sufficiently detailed to enable plans to make reasonable projections regarding the yield curve and such rates for future months based on the plan's projection of future interest rates.
<br>(3) Mortality tables
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C) or (D), the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation prescribe mortality tables to be used in determining any present value or making any computation under this section. Such tables shall be based on the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. In prescribing such tables, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take into account results of available independent studies of mortality of individuals covered by pension plans.
<br>(B) Periodic revision
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall (at least every 10 years) make revisions in any table in effect under subparagraph (A) to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.
<br>(C) Substitute mortality table
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Upon request by the plan sponsor and approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, a mortality table which meets the requirements of clause (iii) shall be used in determining any present value or making any computation under this section during the period of consecutive plan years (not to exceed 10) specified in the request.
<br>(ii) Early termination of period
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (i), a mortality table described in clause (i) shall cease to be in effect as of the earliest of—
<br>
<br>(I) the date on which there is a significant change in the participants in the plan by reason of a plan spinoff or merger or otherwise, or
<br>
<br>(II) the date on which the plan actuary determines that such table does not meet the requirements of clause (iii).
<br>(iii) Requirements
<br>
<br>A mortality table meets the requirements of this clause if—
<br>
<br>(I) there is a sufficient number of plan participants, and the pension plans have been maintained for a sufficient period of time, to have credible information necessary for purposes of subclause (II), and
<br>
<br>(II) such table reflects the actual experience of the pension plans maintained by the sponsor and projected trends in general mortality experience.
<br>(iv) All plans in controlled group must use separate table
<br>
<br>Except as provided by the Secretary of the Treasury, a plan sponsor may not use a mortality table under this subparagraph for any plan maintained by the plan sponsor unless—
<br>
<br>(I) a separate mortality table is established and used under this subparagraph for each other plan maintained by the plan sponsor and if the plan sponsor is a member of a controlled group, each member of the controlled group, and
<br>
<br>(II) the requirements of clause (iii) are met separately with respect to the table so established for each such plan, determined by only taking into account the participants of such plan, the time such plan has been in existence, and the actual experience of such plan.
<br>(v) Deadline for submission and disposition of application
<br>(I) Submission
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall submit a mortality table to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval under this subparagraph at least 7 months before the 1st day of the period described in clause (i).
<br>(II) Disposition
<br>
<br>Any mortality table submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval under this subparagraph shall be treated as in effect as of the 1st day of the period described in clause (i) unless the Secretary of the Treasury, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of such submission, disapproves of such table and provides the reasons that such table fails to meet the requirements of clause (iii). The 180-day period shall be extended upon mutual agreement of the Secretary of the Treasury and the plan sponsor.
<br>(D) Separate mortality tables for the disabled
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)—
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish mortality tables which may be used (in lieu of the tables under subparagraph (A)) under this subsection for individuals who are entitled to benefits under the plan on account of disability. The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish separate tables for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning on or after such date.
<br>(ii) Special rule for disabilities occurring after 1994
<br>
<br>In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under clause (i) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] and the regulations thereunder.
<br>(iii) Periodic revision
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall (at least every 10 years) make revisions in any table in effect under clause (i) to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.
<br>(4) Probability of benefit payments in the form of lump sums or other optional forms
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining any present value or making any computation under this section, there shall be taken into account—
<br>
<br>(A) the probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of optional forms of benefits provided under the plan (including lump sum distributions, determined on the basis of the plan's experience and other related assumptions), and
<br>
<br>(B) any difference in the present value of such future benefit payments resulting from the use of actuarial assumptions, in determining benefit payments in any such optional form of benefits, which are different from those specified in this subsection.
<br>(5) Approval of large changes in actuarial assumptions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>No actuarial assumption used to determine the funding target for a plan to which this paragraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(B) Plans to which paragraph applies
<br>
<br>This paragraph shall apply to a plan only if—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan is a single-employer plan to which subchapter III applies,
<br>
<br>(ii) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 1301(a)(13) of this title) and members of such sponsors' controlled groups (as defined in section 1301(a)(14) of this title) which are covered by subchapter III (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the funding shortfall of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the funding target of the plan before such change.
<br>(i) Special rules for at-risk plans
<br>(1) Funding target for plans in at-risk status
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan which is in at-risk status for a plan year, the funding target of the plan for the plan year shall be equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, as determined by using the additional actuarial assumptions described in subparagraph (B), and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a plan which also has been in at-risk status for at least 2 of the 4 preceding plan years, a loading factor determined under subparagraph (C).
<br>(B) Additional actuarial assumptions
<br>
<br>The actuarial assumptions described in this subparagraph are as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) All employees who are not otherwise assumed to retire as of the valuation date but who will be eligible to elect benefits during the plan year and the 10 succeeding plan years shall be assumed to retire at the earliest retirement date under the plan but not before the end of the plan year for which the at-risk funding target and at-risk target normal cost are being determined.
<br>
<br>(ii) All employees shall be assumed to elect the retirement benefit available under the plan at the assumed retirement age (determined after application of clause (i)) which would result in the highest present value of benefits.
<br>(C) Loading factor
<br>
<br>The loading factor applied with respect to a plan under this paragraph for any plan year is the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) $700, times the number of participants in the plan, plus
<br>
<br>(ii) 4 percent of the funding target (determined without regard to this paragraph) of the plan for the plan year.
<br>(2) Target normal cost of at-risk plans
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan which is in at-risk status for a plan year, the target normal cost of the plan for such plan year shall be equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the excess of—
<br>
<br>(i) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year, determined using the additional actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (1)(B), plus
<br>
<br>(II) the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year, over
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year, plus
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a plan which also has been in at-risk status for at least 2 of the 4 preceding plan years, a loading factor equal to 4 percent of the amount determined under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) with respect to the plan for the plan year.
<br>(3) Minimum amount
<br>
<br>In no event shall—
<br>
<br>(A) the at-risk funding target be less than the funding target, as determined without regard to this subsection, or
<br>
<br>(B) the at-risk target normal cost be less than the target normal cost, as determined without regard to this subsection.
<br>(4) Determination of at-risk status
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) In general
