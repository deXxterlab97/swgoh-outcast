The Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 was repealed by section 523(a) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97–248, 96 Stat. 695). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, which replaced the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, was enacted as subchapter I of chapter 471 of title 49 by section 1(e) of the Act of July 5, 1994 (Public Law 103–272, 108 Stat. 1245).

Section 12 of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, which provided for a national airport system plan, was replaced by section 504 of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97–248, 96 Stat. 675). Section 504 was enacted as section 47103 of title 49 by section 1(e) of the Act of July 5, 1994 (Public Law 103–272, 108 Stat. 1251).

<br>"(a) Treatment of Glacier Bay Concession Permits Prospectus.—Nothing contained in this title [enacting former sections 5951 to 5966 of Title 16, Conservation, which were repealed and restated in sections 101911 et seq. and 101524 of this title, amending former sections 1a–7 and 3 of Title 16, repealing section 17b–1 and subchapter IV of chapter 1 of Title 16, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 100101 and 101912 of this title] shall authorize or require the Secretary to withdraw, revise, amend, modify, or reissue the February 19, 1998, Prospectus Under Which Concession Permits Will be Open for Competition for the Operation of Cruise Ship Services Within Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (in this section referred to as the '1998 Glacier Bay Prospectus'). The award of concession permits pursuant to the 1998 Glacier Bay Prospectus shall be under provisions of existing law at the time the 1998 Glacier Bay Prospectus was issued.
<br>
<br>"(b) Preferential Right of Renewal.—Notwithstanding any provision of this title, the Secretary, in awarding future Glacier Bay cruise ship concession permits covering cruise ship entries for which a preferential right of renewal existed prior to the effective date of this title [probably means the date of enactment of title IV of Pub.

<br>§101912. Findings and declaration of policy
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—In furtherance of section 100101(a), Congress finds that the preservation and conservation of System unit resources and values requires that public accommodations, facilities, and services that have to be provided within those System units should be provided only under carefully controlled safeguards against unregulated and indiscriminate use, so that—
<br>
<br>(1) visitation will not unduly impair those resources and values; and
<br>
<br>(2) development of public accommodations, facilities, and services within System units can best be limited to locations that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the System units.
<br>
<br>(b) Declaration of Policy.—It is the policy of Congress that the development of public accommodations, facilities, and services in System units shall be limited to accommodations, facilities, and services that—
<br>
<br>(1) are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the System unit in which they are located; and
<br>
<br>(2) are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the System unit.

The repeal of such Act shall not affect the validity of any concessions contract or permit entered into under such Act, but the provisions of this title [enacting former sections 5951 to 5966 of Title 16, Conservation, which were repealed and restated in sections 101911 et seq. and 101524 of this title, amending former sections 1a–7 and 3 of Title 16, repealing section 17b–1 and subchapter IV of chapter 1 of Title 16, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 100101 and 101911 of this title] shall apply to any such contract or permit except to the extent such provisions are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any such contract or permit. References in this title to concessions contracts awarded under authority of such Act also apply to concessions permits awarded under such authority."
<br>§101913. Award of concession contracts
<br>
<br>In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section 101912 of this title, and except as provided by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concession contracts to authorize a person, corporation, or other entity to provide accommodations, facilities, and services to visitors to System units. Concession contracts shall be awarded as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) Competitive selection process.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, all proposed concession contracts shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, or other entity submitting the best proposal, as determined by the Secretary through a competitive selection process.

<br>
<br>(2) Solicitation of proposals.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concession contract (including renewals or extensions of existing concession contracts) the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) shall publicly solicit proposals for the concession contract; and
<br>
<br>(B) in connection with the solicitation, shall—
<br>
<br>(i) prepare a prospectus and publish notice of its availability at least once in local or national newspapers or trade publications, by electronic means, or both, as appropriate; and

<br>
<br>(A) The minimum requirements for the contract as set forth in paragraph (4).

<br>
<br>(C) Other authorized facilities or services that may be provided in a proposal.
<br>
<br>(D) Facilities and services to be provided by the Secretary to the concessioner, including public access, utilities, and buildings.
<br>
<br>(E) An estimate of the amount of compensation due an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the terms of a prior concession contract.
<br>
<br>(F) A statement as to the weight to be given to each selection factor identified in the prospectus and the relative importance of those factors in the selection process.
<br>
<br>(G) Other information related to the proposed concession operation that is provided to the Secretary pursuant to a concession contract or is otherwise available to the Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow for the submission of competitive proposals.
<br>
<br>(H) Where applicable, a description of a preferential right to the renewal of the proposed concession contract held by an existing concessioner as set forth in paragraph (7).
<br>
<br>(4) Consideration of proposals.—
<br>
<br>(A) Minimum requirements.—No proposal shall be considered that fails to meet the minimum requirements as determined by the Secretary. The minimum requirements shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(i) The minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of consideration to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(ii) Any facilities, services, or capital investment required to be provided by the concessioner.
<br>
<br>(iii) Measures necessary to ensure the protection, conservation, and preservation of resources of the System unit.
<br>
<br>(B) Rejection of proposal.—The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the person, corporation, or entity is not qualified or is not likely to provide satisfactory service; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the proposal is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.
<br>
<br>(C) All proposals fail to meet mimimum 1 requirements or are rejected.—If all proposals submitted to the Secretary fail to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection process pursuant to this section.
<br>
<br>(D) Terms and conditions materially amended or not incorporated in contract.—The Secretary may not execute a concession contract that materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed terms and conditions of the concession contract as set forth in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concession contract incorporating the material amendments or changes.
<br>
<br>(5) Selection of the best proposal.—
<br>
<br>(A) Factors in selection.—In selecting the best proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following principal factors:
<br>
<br>(i) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.
<br>
<br>(ii) The experience and related background of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including the past performance and expertise of the person, corporation or entity in providing the same or similar facilities or services.
<br>
<br>(iii) The financial capability of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal.
<br>
<br>(iv) The proposed franchise fee, except that consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities to the public at reasonable rates.
<br>
<br>(B) Secondary factors.—The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.
<br>
<br>(C) Development of regulations.—In developing regulations to implement this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession contract should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best proposal under this section.
<br>
<br>(6) Congressional notification.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The Secretary shall submit any proposed concession contract with anticipated annual gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of more than 10 years to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(B) Waiting period.—The Secretary shall not award any proposed concession contract to which subparagraph (A) applies until at least 60 days subsequent to the notification of both Committees.
<br>
<br>(7) Preferential right of renewal.—

<br>

<br>
<br>(8) Outfitter and guide services and small contracts.—
<br>
<br>(A) Application.—Paragraph (7) shall apply only to the following:
<br>
<br>(i) Subject to subparagraph (B), concession contracts that solely authorize the provision of specialized backcountry outdoor recreation guide services that require the employment of specially trained and experienced guides to accompany System unit visitors in the backcountry so as to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors who otherwise may not have the skills and equipment to engage in that activity.
<br>
<br>(ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), concession contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts under $500,000.
<br>
<br>(B) Outfitting and guide concessioners.—
<br>
<br>(i) Description.—Outfitting and guide concessioners, where otherwise qualified, include concessioners that provide guided river running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and mountaineering experiences.
<br>
<br>(ii) When entitled to preferential right.—An outfitting and guide concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter only if—
<br>
<br>(I) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner does not grant the concessioner any interest, including any leasehold surrender interest or possessory interest, in capital improvements on land owned by the United States within a System unit, other than a capital improvement constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract prior to November 13, 1998, or constructed or owned by a concessioner or the concessioner's predecessor before the subject land was incorporated into the System;
<br>
<br>(II) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension); and
<br>
<br>(III) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(C) Contract with estimated gross receipts of less than $500,000.—A concessioner that holds a concession contract that the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts of less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter if—

<br>
<br>(ii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(9) New or additional services.—The Secretary may propose to amend the applicable terms of an existing concessions contract to provide new and additional services where the Secretary determines the services are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located and are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit. Such new and additional services shall not represent a material change to the required and authorized services as set forth in the applicable prospectus or contract.
<br>
<br>(10) Authority of secretary not limited.—Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to determine whether to issue a concession contract or to establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the policies expressed in this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(11) Exceptions.—Notwithstanding this section, the Secretary may award, without public solicitation, the following:

<br>
<br>(B) Contract in extraordinary circumstances.—The Secretary may award a concession contract in extraordinary circumstances where compelling and equitable considerations require the award of a concession contract to a particular party in the public interest. Award of a concession contract under this subparagraph shall not be made by the Secretary until at least 30 days after—
<br>
<br>(i) publication in the Federal Register of notice of the Secretary's intention to award the contract and the reasons for the action; and

<br>In paragraph (1), the words "entities seeking award of a concession contract" are substituted for "concessions contracts" for clarity.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (2)(B)(i), the words "by electronic means" are substituted for "the Commerce Business Daily" to eliminate obsolete words.

<br>
<br>In paragraph (5)(C), the words "concession contract" are substituted for "concession, contracts" to correct an error in the source provision.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (8)(B)(ii)(III), the word "concession" is added for consistency in this subchapter.

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2016—Par. (9). Pub. L. 114–289 amended par. (9) generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "The Secretary shall not grant a preferential right to a concessioner to provide new or additional services in a System unit."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "minimum".
<br>§101914. Term of concession contracts
<br>
<br>A concession contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less. The Secretary may award a contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term.

<br>§101915. Protection of concessioner investment
<br>
<br>(a) Definitions.—In this section:
<br>
<br>(1) Capital improvement.—The term "capital improvement" means a structure, a fixture, or nonremovable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract and located on land of the United States within a System unit.
<br>
<br>(2) Consumer price index.—The term "Consumer Price Index" means—
<br>
<br>(A) the "Consumer Price Index—All Urban Consumers" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor; or
<br>
<br>(B) if the Index is not published, another regularly published cost-of-living index approximating the Consumer Price Index.
<br>
<br>(b) Leasehold Surrender Interest in Capital Improvements.—A concessioner that constructs a capital improvement on land owned by the United States within a System unit pursuant to a concession contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concession contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.
<br>
<br>(2) Pledge as security.—A leasehold surrender interest may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(3) Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest.—A leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner.
<br>
<br>(4) Limit on extinguishing or taking interest.—A leasehold surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.
<br>
<br>(5) Value of interest.—The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.
<br>
<br>(6) Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.—
<br>
<br>(A) How value is determined.—The Secretary may provide, in any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on November 12, 1998; or
<br>
<br>(ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(B) When alternative formula may be used.—The Secretary may use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the Federal Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes the alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (5).
<br>
<br>(7) Increase in value of interest.—Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.
<br>
<br>(c) Special Rule for Possessory Interest Existing Before November 13, 1998.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A concessioner that has obtained a possessory interest (as defined pursuant to the Act of October 9, 1965 (known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; Public Law 89–249, 79 Stat. 969), as in effect on November 12, 1998) under the terms of a concession contract entered into before November 13, 1998, shall, on the expiration or termination of the concession contract, be entitled to receive compensation for the possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by the concession contract. Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing concession contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on November 12, 1998.
<br>
<br>(2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract.—A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.
<br>
<br>(3) New concessioner awarded a contract.—A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract.
<br>
<br>(4) De novo review of value determination.—If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.
<br>
<br>(d) Transition to Successor Concessioner.—On expiration or termination of a concession contract entered into after November 13, 1998, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the concession contract to receive from the United States or a successor concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement as of the date of the expiration or termination. A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement under the terms of a new concession contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concession contract.
<br>
<br>(e) Title to Improvements.—Title to any capital improvement constructed by a concessioner on land owned by the United States in a System unit shall be vested in the United States.
