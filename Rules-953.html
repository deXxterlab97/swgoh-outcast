<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13908, Feb. 28, 2020, 85 F.R. 12983, provided:

<br>
<br>Section 1. Establishment of Interagency Committee. The Interagency Committee on Trade in Automotive Goods (Committee) is hereby established to provide advice, as appropriate, on the implementation, enforcement, and modification of provisions of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (Agreement) that relate to automotive goods, including the automotive rules of origin and the alternative staging regime that are part of such rules. The Committee shall also review the operation of the Agreement with respect to trade in automotive goods, including the economic effects of the automotive rules of origin on the United States economy, workers, and consumers, and the impact of new technology on such rules.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Membership. The Committee shall be composed of the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Chairman of the United States International Trade Commission, and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland Security. Members of the Committee may designate an officer of the United States within their respective executive department, agency, or component to serve as their representative on the Committee. The USTR shall serve as Chair of the Committee. The USTR may invite representatives from other executive departments or agencies, as the USTR determines are necessary, to participate as members or observers, and shall include the Secretary of the Treasury as a member of the Committee. Each executive department, agency, and component represented on the Committee shall ensure that the necessary staff are available to assist in performing the responsibilities of the Committee.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Committee Decision-making. The Committee shall endeavor to make any recommendation on an action or determination under section 202A of the Act by consensus, which shall be deemed to exist where no Committee member objects to the proposed action or determination. If the Committee is unable to reach a consensus on a proposed action or determination, the Committee may decide the matter by majority vote of its members if the Chair determines that allotting further time will unduly delay implementation of provisions of the Agreement that relate to automotive goods. The Chair, in addition to voting, may also break any tie vote.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Implementing Measures. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, are directed to issue, in consultation with the USTR (and with each other, as directed in the Act), such regulations and other measures as are necessary or appropriate to implement section 202A of the Act.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the Committee's functions described in section 202A of the Act.
<br>
<br>(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—APPLICATION OF USMCA TO SECTORS AND SERVICES
<br>Part A—Relief From Injury Caused by Import Competition
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–113, title V, §502(a), (d), Jan. 29, 2020, 134 Stat. 70, struck out "[reserved]" at end of part heading and reenacted part heading without change.
<br>§4551. USMCA article impact in import relief cases under Trade Act of 1974
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>If, in any investigation initiated under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.], the International Trade Commission makes an affirmative determination (or a determination which the President may treat as an affirmative determination under such chapter by reason of section 1330(d) of this title), the International Trade Commission shall also find (and report to the President at the time such injury determination is submitted to the President) whether—
<br>
<br>(1) imports of the article from a USMCA country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports; and
<br>
<br>(2) imports of the article from a USMCA country, considered individually or, in exceptional circumstances, imports from USMCA countries considered collectively, contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports.
<br>(b) Factors
<br>(1) Substantial import share
<br>
<br>In determining whether imports from a USMCA country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports, such imports normally shall not be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if that country is not among the top 5 suppliers of the article subject to the investigation, measured in terms of import share during the most recent 3-year period.
<br>(2) Application of "contribute importantly" standard
<br>
<br>In determining whether imports from a USMCA country or countries contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the International Trade Commission shall consider such factors as the change in the import share of the USMCA country or countries, and the level and change in the level of imports of such country or countries. In applying the preceding sentence, imports from a USMCA country or countries normally shall not be considered to contribute importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of imports from such country or countries during the period in which an injurious increase in imports occurred is appreciably lower than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same period.
<br>(c) "Contribute importantly" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section and section 4552(a) of this title, the term "contribute importantly" refers to an important cause, but not necessarily the most important cause.

<br>In determining the nature and extent of action to be taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.], the President shall exclude from such action imports from a USMCA country if the President makes a negative determination under subsection (a)(1) or (2) with respect to imports from such country.

<br>
<br>If the President, under subsection (b), excludes imports from a USMCA country or countries from action under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.] but thereafter determines that a surge in imports from that country or countries is undermining the effectiveness of the action—
<br>
<br>(A) the President may take appropriate action under such chapter 1 to include those imports in the action; and
<br>
<br>(B) any entity that is representative of an industry for which such action is being taken may request the International Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of the surge in such imports.
<br>(2) Investigation
<br>
<br>Upon receiving a request under paragraph (1)(B), the International Trade Commission shall conduct an investigation to determine whether a surge in such imports undermines the effectiveness of the action. The International Trade Commission shall submit the findings of its investigation to the President no later than 30 days after the request is received by the International Trade Commission.

<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "surge" means a significant increase in imports over the trend for a recent representative base period.

<br>
<br>(2) whether a person of Mexico who has received a grant of authority on or after the date of entry into force of the USMCA and retains such grant of authority is causing or threatens to cause material harm to a United States long-haul trucking services industry; or
<br>
<br>(3) whether, with respect to a person of Mexico who has received a grant of authority before the date of entry into force of the USMCA and retains such grant of authority, there has been a change in circumstances such that such person of Mexico is causing or threatens to cause material harm to a United States long-haul trucking services industry.
