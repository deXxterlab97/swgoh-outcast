<br>(e) Early application and estimated award demonstration program
<br>(1) Purpose and objectives
<br>

Additional objectives associated with implementation of the demonstration program are the following:
<br>
<br>(A) To measure the feasibility of enabling dependent students to apply for Federal, State, and institutional financial aid in their junior year of secondary school, using information from two years prior to the year of enrollment, by completing any of the forms under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) To identify whether receiving final financial aid award estimates not later than the fall of the senior year of secondary school provides students with additional time to compete for the limited resources available for State and institutional financial aid and positively impacts the college aspirations and plans of these students.
<br>
<br>(C) To measure the impact of using income information from the years prior to enrollment on—
<br>
<br>(i) eligibility for financial aid under this subchapter and for other State and institutional aid; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the cost of financial aid programs under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(D) To effectively evaluate the benefits and adverse effects of the demonstration program on program costs, integrity, distribution, and delivery of financial aid.
<br>(2) Program authorized
<br>
<br>Not later than two years after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall implement an early application demonstration program enabling dependent students who wish to participate in the program—
<br>
<br>(A) to complete an application under this subsection during the academic year that is two years prior to the year such students plan to enroll in an institution of higher education; and
<br>
<br>(B) based on the application described in subparagraph (A), to obtain, not later than one year prior to the year of the students' planned enrollment, information on eligibility for Federal Pell Grants, Federal student loans under this subchapter, and State and institutional financial aid for the student's first year of enrollment in the institution of higher education.
<br>(3) Early application and estimated award
<br>
<br>For all dependent students selected for participation in the demonstration program who submit a completed FAFSA, or, as appropriate, an EZ FAFSA, two years prior to the year such students plan to enroll in an institution of higher education, the Secretary shall, not later than one year prior to the year of such planned enrollment—
<br>
<br>(A) provide each student who completes an early application with an estimated determination of such student's—
<br>
<br>(i) expected family contribution for the first year of the student's enrollment in an institution of higher education; and
<br>
<br>(ii) Federal Pell Grant award for the first such year, based on the Federal Pell Grant amount, determined under section 1070a(b)(2)(A) of this title, for which a student is eligible at the time of application; and
<br>
<br>(B) remind the students of the need to update the students' information during the calendar year of enrollment using the expedited reapplication process provided for in subsection (a)(4)(A).
<br>(4) Participants
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall include as participants in the demonstration program—
<br>

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall continue to examine—
<br>
<br>(A) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;
<br>
<br>(B) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—

<br>
<br>(ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer; and
<br>
<br>(C) whether the data elements collected on the FAFSA that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid, or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs under this subchapter, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.
<br>(2) Report on FAFSA simplification efforts to date
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall provide a written report to the authorizing committees on the work the Department has done with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding—
<br>
<br>(A) how the expected family contribution of a student can be calculated using substantially less income and asset information than was used on March 31, 2008;
<br>
<br>(B) the extent to which the reduced income and asset information will result in a redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter, State aid, or institutional aid, or in a change in the composition of the group of recipients of such aid, and the amount of such redistribution;
<br>
<br>(C) how the alternative approaches for calculating the expected family contribution will—
<br>
<br>(i) rely mainly, in the case of students and parents who file income tax returns, on information available on the 1040, 1040EZ, and 1040A; and
<br>
<br>(ii) include formulas for adjusting income or asset information to produce similar results to the existing approach with less data;
<br>
<br>(D) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary of Education income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;
<br>
<br>(E) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—
<br>
<br>(i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data; or
<br>
<br>(ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer;
<br>
<br>(F) the extent to which the use of income data from two years prior to a student's planned enrollment date will change the expected family contribution computed in accordance with part F, and potential adjustments to the need analysis formula that will minimize the change; and
<br>
<br>(G) the extent to which the data elements collected on the FAFSA on March 31, 2008, that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.
<br>(3) Study

<br>
<br>The Comptroller General, in consultation with the study group convened under subparagraph (A) shall—
<br>
<br>(i) review and build on the work of the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury, and individuals with expertise in analysis of financial need, to assess alternative approaches for calculating the expected family contribution under the statutory need analysis formula in effect on the day before August 14, 2008, and under a new calculation that will use substantially less income and asset information than was used for the 2008–2009 FAFSA;
<br>
<br>(ii) conduct an additional analysis if necessary; and
<br>
<br>(iii) make recommendations to the authorizing committees.
<br>(C) Objectives of study
<br>
<br>The objectives of the study required under subparagraph (B) are—
<br>
<br>(i) to determine methods to shorten the FAFSA and make the FAFSA easier and less time-consuming to complete, thereby increasing higher education access for low-income students;
<br>
<br>(ii) to identify changes to the statutory need analysis formula that will be necessary to reduce the amount of financial information students and families need to provide to receive a determination of eligibility for student financial aid without causing significant redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(iii) to review State and institutional needs and uses for data collected on the FAFSA, and to determine the best means of addressing such needs in the case of modification of the FAFSA as described in clause (i), or modification of the need analysis formula as described in clause (ii).
<br>(D) Required subjects of study
<br>
<br>The study required under subparagraph (B) shall examine—
<br>
<br>(i) with respect to simplification of the financial aid application process using the statutory requirements for need analysis—

<br>
<br>(aa) whether a State uses, as of the time of the study, or can use, a student's expected family contribution based on data from two years prior to the student's planned enrollment date;
<br>
<br>(bb) the extent to which States and institutions will accept the data provided by the Internal Revenue Service to prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA to determine the distribution of State and institutional student financial aid funds;
<br>
<br>(cc) what data are used by States, as of the time of the study, to determine eligibility for State student financial aid, and whether the data are used for merit- or need-based aid;
<br>
<br>(dd) whether State data are required by State law, State regulations, or policy directives; and
<br>
<br>(ee) the extent to which any State-specific information requirements can be met by completion of a State application linked to the electronic version of the FAFSA; and
<br>
<br>(III) information on institutional needs, including the extent to which institutions of higher education are already using supplemental forms to collect additional data from students and their families to determine eligibility for institutional funds; and
<br>
<br>(ii) ways to reduce the amount of financial information students and families need to provide to receive a determination of eligibility for student financial aid, taking into account—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount of redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter caused by such a reduction, and the benefits to be gained by having an application process that will be easier for students and their families;
<br>
<br>(II) students and families who do not file income tax returns;
<br>
<br>(III) the extent to which the full array of income and asset information collected on the FAFSA, as of the time of the study, plays an important role in the awarding of need-based State financial aid, and whether the State can use an expected family contribution generated by the FAFSA, instead of income and asset information or a calculation with reduced data elements, to support determinations of eligibility for such State aid programs and, if not, what additional information will be needed or what changes to the FAFSA will be required; and
<br>
<br>(IV) information on institutional needs, including the extent to which institutions of higher education are already using supplemental forms to collect additional data from students and their families to determine eligibility for institutional funds; and
