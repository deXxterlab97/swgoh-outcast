<br>§3716. Administrative offset
<br>
<br>(a) After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor—
<br>
<br>(1) written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor under this section;
<br>
<br>(2) an opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;
<br>
<br>(3) an opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and
<br>
<br>(4) an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.
<br>
<br>(b) Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency must either—
<br>
<br>(1) adopt, without change, regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or
<br>
<br>(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials offset such claims.
<br>
<br>(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education under a program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative offset under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment certifying agency shall be liable—
<br>
<br>(A) for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied; or
<br>
<br>(B) for failure to provide timely notice under paragraph (8).
<br>
<br>(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public Law 91–173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause (ii), all payments due to an individual under—
<br>
<br>(I) the Social Security Act,
<br>
<br>(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or
<br>
<br>(III) any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits),
<br>
<br>shall be subject to offset under this section.
<br>
<br>(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official shall—
<br>
<br>(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit payments made during such 12-month period which are not subject to offset under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor during the applicable 12-month period.
<br>
<br>For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program under which such payment is authorized to be made (including any reduction or deduction to recover any overpayment under such program).
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from administrative offset under this subsection payments under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from administrative offset under this subsection upon the written request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written request for exemption of other payments must provide justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.
<br>
<br>(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1), 809(a)(1), and 1631(c)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits authorized by title II, VIII, or title XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively.
<br>
<br>(D) This section shall apply to payments made after the date which is 90 days after the enactment of this subparagraph (or such earlier date as designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services) with respect to claims or debts, and to amounts payable, under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by the United States as fees under this subsection shall be deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that section.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 120 days delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall notify Congress of any instance in which an agency fails to notify the Secretary as required under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the payee in writing of—
<br>
<br>(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including a description of the type and amount of the payment otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset was executed;
<br>
<br>(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.
<br>
<br>(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not impair the legality of such administrative offset.
<br>
<br>(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset pursuant to other laws.
<br>
<br>(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use of any other administrative offset authority existing under statute or common law.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or administrative limitation, no limitation on the period within which an offset may be initiated or taken pursuant to this section shall be effective.
<br>
<br>(2) This section does not apply when a statute explicitly prohibits using administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or type of claim involved.
<br>
<br>(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 552a(o) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims collection upon written certification by the head of a State or an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been met.
<br>
<br>(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a description of any matching activities conducted under this section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection (f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if—
<br>
<br>(A) the appropriate State disbursing official requests that an offset be performed; and
<br>
<br>(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in effect which contains, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(i) requirements substantially equivalent to subsection (b) of this section; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any other requirements which the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.
<br>
<br>(2) This subsection does not apply to—
<br>
<br>(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which the administrative costs associated with the collection of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or claim;
<br>
<br>(B) any collection of any other type, class, or amount of claim, as the Secretary considers necessary to protect the interest of the United States; or
<br>
<br>(C) the disbursement of any class or type of payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of a Federal agency.
<br>
<br>(3) In applying this section with respect to any debt owed to a State, subsection (c)(3)(A) shall not apply.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13019. Supporting Families: Collecting Delinquent Child Support Obligations
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13019, Sept. 28, 1996, 61 F.R. 51763, provided that:
<br>
<br>The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104–134 [§31001] (110 Stat. 1321–358 et seq.) [see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 3701 of this title], was enacted into law on April 26, 1996, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996. While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection Improvement Act is to increase the collection of nontax debts owed to the Federal Government, the Act also contains important provisions that can be used to assist families in collecting past-due child support obligations.
<br>
<br>The failure of some parents to meet their child support obligations threatens the health, education, and well-being of their children. Compounding this problem, States have experienced difficulties enforcing child support obligations once a parent has moved to another State. With this Executive order, my Administration takes additional steps to support our children and strengthen American families by facilitating the collection of delinquent child support obligations from persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive certain Federal payments or Federal assistance.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Administrative Offsets. (a)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury ("the Secretary"), in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly develop and implement procedures necessary for the Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of affected agencies, deems appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the Department of the Treasury and other executive departments and agencies that disburse Federal payments.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal agreements with States concerning the collection by the Secretary of delinquent child support debts through administrative offsets.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within 120 days of the date of this order, implement procedures necessary to report to the Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child support claims referred by States (including claims enforced by States pursuant to cooperative agreements with or by Indian tribal governments) to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<br>(c) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary or to another disbursing official shall review each class of payments that the department or agency certifies to determine if any such class should be exempt from offset and, if any class is so identified, submit to the Secretary a request for such an exemption together with the reasons therefor.

<br>§3717. Interest and penalty on claims
<br>
<br>(a)(1) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency shall charge a minimum annual rate of interest on an outstanding debt on a United States Government claim owed by a person that is equal to the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. The Secretary of the Treasury shall publish the rate before November 1 of that year. The rate is effective on the first day of the next calendar quarter.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may change the rate of interest for a calendar quarter if the average investment rate for the 12-month period ending at the close of the prior calendar quarter, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, is more or less than the existing published rate by 2 percentage points.
<br>
<br>(b) Interest under subsection (a) of this section accrues from the date—
<br>
<br>(1) on which notice is mailed after October 25, 1982, if notice was first mailed before October 25, 1982; or
<br>
<br>(2) notice of the amount due is first mailed to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor available to the head of the executive or 1 legislative agency, if notice is first mailed after October 24, 1982.
<br>
<br>(c) The rate of interest charged under subsection (a) of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) is the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to accrue under subsection (b) of this section; and
<br>
<br>(2) remains fixed at that rate for the duration of the indebtedness.
<br>
<br>(d) Interest under subsection (a) of this section may not be charged if the amount due on the claim is paid within 30 days after the date from which interest accrues under subsection (b) of this section. The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may extend the 30-day period.
<br>
<br>(e) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency shall assess on a claim owed by a person—
<br>
<br>(1) a charge to cover the cost of processing and handling a delinquent claim; and
<br>
<br>(2) a penalty charge of not more than 6 percent a year for failure to pay a part of a debt more than 90 days past due.
<br>
<br>(f) Interest under subsection (a) of this section does not accrue on a charge assessed under subsection (e) of this section.
<br>
<br>(g) This section does not apply—
<br>
<br>(1) if a statute, regulation required by statute, loan agreement, or contract prohibits charging interest or assessing charges or explicitly fixes the interest or charges; and
<br>
<br>(2) to a claim under a contract executed before October 25, 1982, that is in effect on October 25, 1982.

A waiver under the regulations is deemed to be compliance with this section.
<br>
<br>(i)(1) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may increase an administrative claim by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. Adjustments under this subsection will be computed annually.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "cost of living adjustment" means the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the claim was determined or last adjusted; and
<br>

<br>§3718. Contracts for collection services
<br>
<br>(a) Under conditions the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may enter into a contract with a person for collection service to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government. The head of an agency may not enter into a contract under the preceding sentence to locate or recover assets of the United States held by a State government or financial institution unless that agency has established procedures approved by the Secretary of the Treasury to identify and recover such assets. The contract shall provide that—
<br>
<br>(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and
<br>
<br>(2) the person is subject to—
<br>
<br>(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and
<br>
<br>(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.
<br>
<br>(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in division C (except sections 3302, 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41.
<br>
<br>(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns (as defined in section 31(b) of the Small Business Act), so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(2) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns. For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals" means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses;
<br>
<br>(B) "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals" shall be presumed to include these 1 groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act; and
<br>
<br>(C) the term "qualified HUBZone small business concern" has the meaning given that term in section 31(b) of the Small Business Act.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;
<br>
<br>(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or 2 legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and
<br>
<br>(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or 2 legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.
<br>
<br>(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.
<br>
<br>(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.
<br>
<br>(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of—
<br>
<br>(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;
<br>
<br>(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and
<br>
<br>(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)—
<br>
<br>(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;
<br>
<br>(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and
<br>
<br>(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.
<br>
<br>(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.
<br>
<br>(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
<br>
<br>(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the Government Accountability Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys' Offices and by private counsel.

Such a person may obtain additional loans or loan guarantees only after such delinquency is resolved in accordance with those standards. The Secretary of the Treasury may exempt, at the request of an agency, any class of claims.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
<br>§3721. Claims of personnel of agencies and the District of Columbia government for personal property damage or loss
<br>
<br>(a) In this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "agency" does not include a nonappropriated fund activity or a contractor with the United States Government.
<br>
<br>(2) "head of an agency" means—
<br>
<br>(A) for a military department, the Secretary of the military department;
<br>
<br>(B) for the Department of Defense (except the military departments), the Secretary of Defense; and
<br>
<br>(C) for another agency, the head of the agency.
<br>
<br>(3) "settle" means consider, determine, adjust, and dispose of a claim by disallowance or by complete or partial allowance.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The head of an agency may settle and pay not more than $40,000 for a claim against the Government made by a member of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the agency or by an officer or employee of the agency for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service. If, however, the claim arose from an emergency evacuation or from extraordinary circumstances, the amount settled and paid under the authority of the preceding sentence may exceed $40,000, but may not exceed $100,000. A claim allowed under this subsection may be paid in money or the personal property replaced in kind.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of State may waive the settlement and payment limitation referred to in paragraph (1) for claims for damage or loss by United States Government personnel under the jurisdiction of a chief of mission in a foreign country if such claims arise in circumstances where there is in effect a departure from the country authorized or ordered under circumstances described in section 5522(a) of title 5, if the Secretary determines that there exists exceptional circumstances that warrant such a waiver.
<br>
<br>(c) On paying a claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against a foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.
<br>
<br>(d) The Mayor of the District of Columbia may settle and pay a claim against the District of Columbia government made by an officer or employee of the District of Columbia government to the same extent the head of an agency may settle and pay a claim under this section.
<br>
<br>(e) A claim may not be allowed under this section if the personal property damage or loss occurred at quarters occupied by the claimant in a State or the District of Columbia that were not assigned or provided in kind by the United States Government or the District of Columbia government.
<br>
<br>(f) A claim may be allowed under this section only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the claim is substantiated;
<br>
<br>(2) the head of the agency decides that possession of the property was reasonable or useful under the circumstances; and
<br>
<br>(3) no part of the loss was caused by any negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or an agent or employee of the claimant.
<br>
<br>(g) A claim may be allowed under this section only if it is presented in writing within 2 years after the claim accrues. However, if a claim under subsection (b) of this section accrues during war or an armed conflict in which an armed force of the United States is involved, or has accrued within 2 years before war or an armed conflict begins, and for cause shown, the claim must be presented within 2 years after the cause no longer exists or after the war or armed conflict ends, whichever is earlier. An armed conflict begins and ends as stated in a concurrent resolution of Congress or a decision of the President.
<br>
<br>(h) The head of the agency—
<br>
<br>(1) may settle and pay a claim made by the surviving spouse, child, parent, or brother or sister of a dead member, officer, or employee if the claim is otherwise payable under this section; and
<br>
<br>(2) may settle and pay the claims by the survivors only in the following order:
<br>
<br>(A) the spouse's claim.
<br>
<br>(B) a child's claim.
<br>
<br>(C) a parent's claim.
<br>
<br>(D) a brother's or sister's claim.
<br>
<br>(i) Notwithstanding a contract, the representative of a claimant may not receive more than 10 percent of a payment of a claim made under this section for services related to the claim. A person violating this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.
<br>
<br>(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.
<br>
<br>(k) Settlement of a claim under this section is final and conclusive.
