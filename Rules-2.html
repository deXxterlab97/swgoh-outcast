<br>19:22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
<br>
<br>19:23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
<br>
<br>19:24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.
<br>
<br>19:25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>19:26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
<br>
<br>19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
<br>
<br>19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>19:29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
<br>
<br>19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
<br>
<br>19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
<br>
<br>19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
<br>
<br>20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
<br>
<br>20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
<br>
<br>20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
<br>
<br>20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.
<br>
<br>20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
<br>
<br>20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
<br>
<br>20:11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
<br>
<br>20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
<br>
<br>20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
<br>
<br>20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
<br>
<br>20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
<br>
<br>20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
<br>
<br>20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
<br>
<br>20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
<br>
<br>20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
<br>
<br>20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
<br>
<br>20:21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
<br>
<br>20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.
<br>
<br>20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
<br>
<br>20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.
<br>
<br>20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
<br>
<br>20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.
<br>
<br>20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.
<br>
<br>21:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people: 21:2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.
<br>
<br>21:3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
<br>
<br>21:4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
<br>
<br>21:5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
<br>
<br>21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
<br>
<br>21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
<br>
<br>21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.
<br>
<br>21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
<br>
<br>21:10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 21:11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 21:12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
<br>
<br>21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
<br>
<br>21:15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
<br>
<br>21:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 21:17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
<br>
<br>21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 21:21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
<br>
<br>21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
<br>
<br>21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
<br>
<br>21:24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>22:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 22:5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 22:6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
<br>
<br>22:7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
<br>
<br>22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
<br>
<br>22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
<br>
<br>22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
<br>
<br>22:12 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
<br>
<br>22:13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.
<br>
<br>22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.
<br>
<br>22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD; 22:16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
<br>
<br>22:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering; 22:19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
<br>
<br>22:20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
<br>
<br>22:21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
<br>
<br>22:22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
<br>
<br>22:24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
<br>
<br>22:25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
<br>
<br>22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
<br>
<br>22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.
<br>
<br>22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 22:33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.
<br>
<br>23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
<br>
<br>23:4 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
<br>
<br>23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.
<br>
<br>23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
<br>
<br>23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
<br>
<br>23:8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
<br>
<br>23:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
<br>
<br>23:12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.
<br>
<br>23:14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<br>
<br>23:15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: 23:16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
<br>
<br>23:20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
<br>
<br>23:21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<br>
<br>23:22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>23:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:24 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
<br>
<br>23:25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:27 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>23:29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
<br>
<br>23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
<br>
<br>23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<br>
<br>23:32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
<br>
<br>23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
<br>
<br>23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.
<br>
<br>23:37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: 23:38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.
<br>
<br>23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
<br>
<br>23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.
<br>
<br>It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
<br>
<br>23:42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 23:43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
<br>
<br>24:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
<br>
<br>24:3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
<br>
<br>24:4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
<br>
<br>24:5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
<br>
<br>24:6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
<br>
<br>24:7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>24:8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
<br>
<br>24:9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
<br>
<br>24:10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 24:11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 24:12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
<br>
<br>24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
<br>
<br>24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
<br>
<br>24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.
<br>
<br>24:17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
<br>
<br>24:18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
<br>
<br>24:19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; 24:20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
<br>
<br>24:21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
<br>
<br>24:22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
<br>
<br>25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
<br>
<br>25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.
<br>
<br>25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
<br>
<br>25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
<br>
<br>25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
<br>
<br>25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
<br>
<br>25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
<br>
<br>25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
<br>
<br>25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
<br>
<br>25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: 25:16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
<br>
<br>25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
<br>
<br>25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
<br>
<br>25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
<br>
<br>25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
<br>
<br>25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
<br>
<br>25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
<br>
<br>25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
<br>
<br>25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
<br>
<br>25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
<br>
<br>25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
<br>
<br>25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
<br>
<br>25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
<br>
<br>25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
<br>
<br>25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
<br>
<br>25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
<br>
<br>25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
<br>
<br>25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
<br>
<br>25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
<br>
<br>25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: 25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.
<br>
<br>25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
<br>
<br>25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
<br>
<br>25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
<br>
<br>25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
<br>
<br>25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
<br>
<br>25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
<br>
<br>25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 25:48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
<br>
<br>25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
<br>
<br>25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
<br>
<br>25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
<br>
<br>25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
<br>
<br>25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.
<br>
<br>25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
<br>
<br>26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
<br>
<br>26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
<br>
<br>26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
<br>
<br>26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
<br>
<br>26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
<br>
<br>26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
<br>
<br>26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
<br>
<br>26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
<br>
<br>26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
<br>
<br>26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
<br>
<br>26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
<br>
<br>26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
<br>
<br>26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
<br>
<br>26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
<br>
<br>26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
<br>
<br>26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
<br>
<br>26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
<br>
<br>26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
<br>
<br>26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
<br>
<br>26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
<br>
<br>26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
<br>
<br>26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
<br>
<br>26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
<br>
<br>26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
<br>
<br>26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
<br>
<br>26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
<br>
<br>26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
<br>
<br>26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
<br>
<br>26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
<br>
<br>26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
<br>
<br>26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
<br>
<br>26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
<br>
<br>26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
<br>
<br>26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.
<br>
<br>26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.
<br>
<br>27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
<br>
<br>27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
<br>
<br>27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
<br>
<br>27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
<br>
<br>27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
<br>
<br>27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
<br>
<br>27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
<br>
<br>27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
<br>
<br>27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: 27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
<br>
<br>27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
<br>
<br>27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
<br>
<br>27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
<br>
<br>27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
<br>
<br>27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
<br>
<br>27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
<br>
<br>27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
<br>
<br>27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
<br>
<br>27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
<br>
<br>27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
<br>
<br>27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
<br>
<br>27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.
<br>
<br>27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
<br>
<br>27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
<br>
<br>27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
<br>
<br>27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
<br>
<br>27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

<br>PREFACE
<br>The following is from the preface to the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English:
<br>The sacred task of translating the Word of God, as revealed to Israel through lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, and sage, began at an early date. According to an ancient rabbinic interpretation, Joshua had the Torah engraved upon the stones of the altar (Joshua 8:32) not in the original Hebrew alone, but in all the languages of mankind, which were held to be seventy, in order that all men might become acquainted with the words of the Scriptures. This statement, with its universalistic tendency, is, of course, a reflex of later times, when the Hebrew Scriptures had become a subject of curiosity and perhaps also of anxiety to the pagan or semi-pagan world.
<br>While this tradition contains an element of truth, it is certain that the primary object of translating the Bible was to minister to a need nearer home. Upon the establishment of the Second Commonwealth under Ezra and Nehemiah, it became imperative to make the Torah of God 'distinct and giving sense' through the means of interpretation (Nehemiah 8:8 and 13:24), that the Word of God might be understood by all the people. The Rabbis perceived in this activity of the first generation of the Sopherim the origin of the Aramaic translation known as the Targum, first made orally and afterwards committed to writing, which was necessitated by the fact that Israel had forgotten the sacred language, and spoke the idiom current in a large part of western Asia. All this, however, is veiled in obscurity, as is the whole inner history of the Jews during the Persian rule.
<br>The historic necessity for translation was repeated with all the great changes in Israel's career. It is enough to point to the Septuagint, or the Greek translation of the Scriptures, the product of Israel's contact with the Hellenistic civilization dominating the world at that time; to the Arabic translation by the Gaon Saadya, when the great majority of the Jewish people came under the sceptre of Mohammedan rulers; and to the German translation by Mendelssohn and his school, at the dawn of a new epoch, which brought the Jews in Europe, most of whom spoke a German dialect, into closer contact with their neighbours. These translations are all historical products intimately connected with Israel's wanderings among the nations and with the great events of mankind in general.
<br>Ancient and continuous as this task of translation was, it would be a mistake to think that there were no misgivings about it. At least it is certain that opinions
<br> 
<br>were divided as to the desirability of such undertakings. While Philo and his Alexandrian coreligionists looked upon the translation of the Seventy as a work of inspired men, the Palestinian Rabbis subsequently considered the day on which the Septuagint was completed as one of the most unfortunate in Israel's history, seeing that the Torah could never be adequately translated. And there are indications enough that the consequences of such translations were not all of a desirable nature. However, in view of the eagerness with which they were undertaken almost in every land and in every great epoch of the world's history, it is evident that the people at large approved of such translations, thinking them to be a heave-offering to the Lord of each newly acquired vernacular adopted in the course of the ever-changing conditions of history, and in particular a tribute to the beauty of Japheth dwelling in the spiritual tents of Israel.
<br>The greatest change in the life of Israel during the last two generations was his renewed acquaintance with English-speaking civilization. Out of a handful of immigrants from Central Europe and the East who saw the shores of the New World, or even of England and her colonies, we have grown under Providence both in numbers and in importance, so that we constitute now the greatest section of Israel living in a single country outside of Russia. We are only following in the footsteps of our great predecessors when, with the growth of our numbers, we have applied ourselves to the sacred task of preparing a new translation of the Bible into the English language, which, unless all signs fail, is to become the current speech of the majority of the children of Israel.
<br>The need of such a translation was felt long ago. Mention may here be made of the work of Isaac Leeser in America, which was both preceded and followed by two translations produced in England: the one by Dr. A. Benisch, the other by Dr. Michael Friedlander. The most popular, however, among these translations was that of Lesser, which was not only the accepted version in all the synagogues of the United States, but was also reproduced in England. Its great merit consisted in the fact that it incorporated all the improvements proposed by the Mendelssohn School and their successors, whose combined efforts were included and further developed in the so-called Zunz Bible, which enjoyed a certain authority among German Jews for several generations. With the advance of time and the progress made in almost all departments of Bible study, it was found that Leeser's translation would bear improvement and recasting.
<br>Steps leading to the preparation of a new translation into the English language were taken by the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1892. It was intended to secure, if possible, through the co-operation of scholars in the United States and in Great Britain, a new translation of each book, and to place it in the
<br> 
<br>hands of an Editorial Committee, who by correspondence with the translators should harmonize the results of the work of the individual contributors. This method was followed until 1901 under the general direction of Doctor Marcus Jastrow, Editor-in-Chief, with Doctor Kaufman Kohler and Doctor Frederick de Sola Mendes as the other members of the Editorial Committee.*
<br>*There is given herewith a list of the translations prepared for the Society: Genesis, Max Landsberg, Rochester, N. Y.
<br>Exodus and Leviticus, L. N. Dembitz (deceased), Louisville, Ky. Numbers, David Philipson, Cincinnati, Ohio.
<br>Deuteronomy, F. de Sola Mendes, New York. Joshua, Joseph H. Hertz, London, England.
<br>Judges, Stephen S. Wise, New York.
<br>II Samuel, Bernard Drachman, New York.
<br>Jeremiah, Sabato Morais (deceased), Philadelphia, Pa. Ezekiel, Henry W. Schneeberger, Baltimore, Md.
<br>Joel, Oscar Cohen (deceased), Mobile, Ala. Amos, H. Pereira Mendes, Now York.
<br>Obadiah and Jonah, J. Voorsanger (deceased), San Francisco, California. Micah, Maurice H. Harris, New York.
<br>Nahum, L. Mayer (deceased), Pittsburgh, Pa. Zephaniah, M. Schlesinger, Albany, N. Y. Haggai, S. Mendelsohn, Wilmington, N. C. Malachi, D. Davidson, New York.
<br>Job, Marcus Jastrow (deceased), Philadelphia, Pa. Ruth, Joseph Krauskopf, Philadelphia, Pa.
<br>Ecclesiastes, Gustav Gottheil (deceased), New York. Esther, William Rosenau, Baltimore, Md.
<br>I and II Chronicles, M. Mielziner (deceased), Cincinnati, Ohio.)
<br>It became apparent in 1901 that by this procedure the publication of a translation of the entire Hebrew Bible would be indefinitely delayed, and accordingly the Book of Psalms, translated by Doctor Kohler and revised by his colleagues, was given to the press and issued in 1903. The death of Doctor Jastrow in that year required the formation of a new committee under the chairmanship of Doctor Solomon Schechter. This committee, however, soon found that the method adopted was too complex, and that it was impossible to accomplish by correspondence the extensive work required.
<br>In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society of America and the Central Conference of American Rabbis reached an agreement to cooperate in bringing out the new
<br> 
<br>translation upon a revised plan of having the entire work done by a Board of Editors instead of endeavoring to harmonize the translations of individual contributors. As a result of this understanding the present Board, composed of Doctor Solomon Schechter, Doctor Cyrus Adler, and Doctor Joseph Jacobs, representing the Jewish Publication Society of America, and Doctor Kaufman Kohler, Doctor David Philipson, and Doctor Samuel Schulman, representing the Central Conference of American Rabbis, was constituted, and by mutual agreement Professor Max L. Margolis was chosen as the seventh member, he to be the Editor-in-Chief of the work and Secretary to the Editorial Board, of which Doctor Cyrus Adler was elected Chairman. Incidentally the selection thus made resulted in an equal representation of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America at New York, of the Hebrew Union College at Cincinnati, and of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning at Philadelphia. For one year Professor Israel Friedlaender acted as a member of the Board in the stead of Doctor Schechter.
<br>The method employed by the Board was as follows:
<br>In preparing the manuscript for consideration by the Board of Editors, Professor Margolis took into account the existing English versions, the standard commentaries, ancient and modern, the translations already made for the Jewish Publication Society of America, the divergent renderings from the Revised Version prepared for the Jews of England, the marginal notes of the Revised Version, and the changes of the American Committee of Revisers. Due weight was given to the ancient versions as establishing a tradition of interpretation, notably the Septuagint and the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Targums, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and the Arabic version of Saadya. Talmudic and midrashic allusions and all available Jewish commentators, both the great medieval authorities, like Rashi, Kimhi, and Ibn Ezra, and the moderns
<br>S. D. Luzzatto, Malbim, and Ehrlich, as well as all the important non-Jewish commentators, were consulted. On this basis, a manuscript was prepared by the Editor-in-Chief and a copy sent to every member of the Board of Editors. Sixteen meetings, covering a period of seven years and occupying one hundred and sixty working days, were held, at which the proposals in this manuscript and many additional suggestions by the members of the Board were considered. Each point was thoroughly discussed, and the view of the majority was incorporated into the manuscript. When the Board was evenly divided, the Chairman cast the deciding vote. From time to time subcommittees were at work upon points left open, and their reports, submitted to the Board, were discussed and voted upon. The proof of the entire work was sent to each member of the Board for revision, and the new proposals which were made by one or another were in turn submitted to a
<br> 
<br>vote by correspondence and to a final vote at the last meeting of the Board, held in October-November, 1915.
<br>The present translation is the first for which a group of men representative of Jewish learning among English-speaking Jews assume joint responsibility, all previous efforts in the English language having been the work of individual translators. It has a character of its own. It aims to combine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the results of biblical scholarship, ancient, medieval, and modern. It gives to the Jewish world a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued with the Jewish consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped, will welcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish traditional point of view.
<br>The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the christological interpretations in non-Jewish translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared for him by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow his soul from others. If a new country and a new language metamorphose him into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb and a new method of expression for what is most sacred and most dear to him.
<br>We are, it is hardly needful to say, deeply grateful for the works of our non- Jewish predecessors, such as the Authorised Version with its admirable diction, which can never be surpassed, as well as for the Revised Version with its ample learning--but they are not ours. The Editors have not only used these famous English versions, but they have gone back to the earlier translations of Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, the Bishops' Bible, and the Douai Version, which is the authorised English translation of the Vulgate used by the Roman Catholics; in a word, upon doubtful points in style, all English versions have been drawn upon. The renditions of parts of the Hebrew Scriptures by Lowth and others in the eighteenth century and by Cheyne and Driver in our own days were likewise consulted.
<br>As to the text and order of the biblical books, the present translation follows Jewish tradition, the Sacred Scriptures having come down in a definite compass and in a definite text. They are separated into three divisions: Law (Torah, Pentateuch), Prophets (Nebi'im), Writings (Ketubim). Each of these possesses a different degree of holiness or authority. In the Prophets and the Writings the order of the books varies in manuscripts or among Jewish authorities; but there is absolute agreement as to the compass of these two divisions, and no book is
<br> 
<br>transposed from the one into the other. Thus Ruth, Lamentations, and Daniel are all placed in the division of Writings--not among the Prophets, as in non-Jewish versions.
<br>With every step by which each of the three parts was sealed, nothing to be added or to be taken away, the text was likewise fixed and thenceforth made the object of zealous watchfulness. Even with regard to the latest book of our Scriptures, we read its text substantially in the form in which the great Rabbi Akiba read it, he who said that the system by which the sacred text was guarded constituted a fence about the Scriptures. In that system, at first oral and later committed to writing, the letters were actually counted and lists made, to the end that no alterations should creep in at the hands of careless scribes. The first to collect the notes known as Masorah was Jacob ben Haim Ibn Adonijah, the editor of the second Rabbinic Bible. In our own day many scholars have been prominent in this field of labour, chief among whom are Wolf Heidenheim, S. Frensdorff, S. Baer, and C. D. Ginsburg. We have followed Baer's texta and for the parts not edited by him that of Ginsburg. Not only does the text known as the masoretic represent the text current in the Synagogue with regard to consonants, but also with regard to its signs standing for vowels and accents, both of which embody the interpretation accepted by the Synagogue. While in the scrolls which are read in the Synagogue the bare consonants are alone permitted, readers must prepare themselves from copies allowed for private use, in ancient times written and now printed, which contain the additional signs for vowels and accents. A translation must naturally follow the guide of the latter. Moreover, the public reader is bound in certain cases to substitute mentally other consonants in the place of those found in the scrolls, in accordance with the marginal annotations in the copies intended for private use. These variants are taken traditionally for corrections, and the public reader who persists in ignoring them forfeits his position. It is true that in the case of such variations the Jewish commentators of the Middle Ages sought to elicit a meaning also from the textual reading, and seem here and there tacitly to give it preference, but all this partakes of the nature of private judgment, and does not affect the uniform practice of the public readings in the Synagogue. While as a rule the margin (Kere) was followed, we have occasionally adopted the consonants of the text (Ketib), as for instance in Ps 139:16, and 2Ch 24:27 34:9.
<br>
<br>a It should be noted that in the otherwise excellent edition of Baer the word חק has been omitted by mistake in Pr 5:20. In Eze 9:9 the Board deviated from the Baer edition and accepted the reading דמים instead of חמס. In Ps 62:4 the. vocalization of Ben Naphtali was followed instead of that of Ben Asher usually adopted by Baer.
<br> 
<br>A translation destined for the people can follow only one text, and that must be the traditional. Nevertheless a translator is not a transcriber of the text. His principal function is to make the Hebrew intelligible. Faithful though he must be to the Hebrew idiom, he will nevertheless be forced by the genius of the English language to use circumlocution, to add a word or two, to alter the sequence of words, and the like. In general, our rule has been that, where the word or words added are implied in the Hebrew construction, no device is used to mark the addition; where, on the other hand, the addition is not at once to be inferred from the original wording and yet seems necessary for the understanding, it has been enclosed in brackets. Naturally opinion will differ as to what may be deemed an addition warranted by the Hebrew construction and what may not, but as intelligibility was the principal aim, the Editors have felt justified in making their additions, sparingly it is true, but nevertheless as often as the occasion required.
<br>We have thought it proper to limit the margin to the shortest compass, confining it to such elucidation of and references to the literal meaning as are absolutely necessary for making the translation intelligible. The Rabbis enumerate eighteen instances in which the scribes consciously altered the text. We have called attention to a change of this nature in Jud 18:30.
<br>Personal pronouns referring to the Deity have been capitalized. As an aid to clearness direct discourse has been indicated by quotation marks. In the prophetical writings, where the speech of the prophet imperceptibly glides into the words of the Deity, and in the legal portions of the Pentateuch, it has been thought best to use quotation marks sparingly. Although the spelling of proper names in the English Bible in many instances deviates somewhat from an accurate representation of the Hebrew, it has nevertheless been deemed wise, owing to the familiarity of Hebrew names in their usual English form, generally to retain the current spelling.
<br>In all externals this translation is especially adapted for use in synagogue and school. The Keriat ha-Torah, or the reading of the section from the Five Books of Moses, is the central feature of the Synagogue service. The Pentateuch is divided into fifty-four sections; beginning with the Sabbath following the Feast of Tabernacles, the readings on the Sabbaths of the year are taken in their order from the Five Books of Moses. The reading consists either of the whole section or of a selected portion. There was a variant custom according to which the reading of the Torah extended over a period of three years instead of one year. However, the one year cycle gradually superseded the three year cycle, and has become the universal custom in the Synagogue.
<br>The Pentateuchal readings are supplemented by readings from the Prophets
<br> 
<br>known as Haftarot. Readings from the third portion of the Bible, though customary at one time, have now largely fallen into disuse. The five small books known as the Five Megillot are given a place in the Synagogue service in their entirety. On the feast of Purim the book of Esther is read; the book of Lamentations is read on Tish'ah be-Ab (Ninth of Ab), the fast-day observed in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem; Song of Songs, Ruth, and Ecclesiastes are read respectively on the Feast of Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
<br>The sections of the Pentateuch as traditionally read on the Sabbath are indicated, and a table gives all Scriptural readings, both on the Sabbath and on feast days and fast days.
<br>By the favor of a gracious Providence the present company of Editors was permitted to finish the work which is now given to the public. The final meeting in November, nineteen hundred and fifteen, was closed with a prayer of thanks to God that the great task was completed and that the group which during seven years had toiled together was intact. Since that day two of our number have been called to the academy on high, Solomon Schechter and Joseph Jacobs, be their memory for a blessing. We grieve that it was not granted these cherished colleagues to live to see the final fruition of their labours; their wholehearted and devoted service is herewith recorded in grateful appreciation. In all humility their co-workers submit this version to the Jewish people in the confident hope that it will aid them in the knowledge of the Word of God.

<br>GENESIS
<br> 
<br>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the  spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. 3And God said: ‘Let there be light.’ And there was light. 4And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening
<br>and there was morning, one day.
<br>6And God said: ‘Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.’ 7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 8And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
<br>9And God said: ‘Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.’ And it was so. 10And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good. 11And God said: ‘Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the
<br> 
<br>earth.’ And it was so. 12And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 13And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
<br>14And God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; 15and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.’ And it was so. 16And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars. 17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
<br>20And God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.’ 21And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 22And God
<br> 
<br>blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.’ 23And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
<br>24And God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.’ And it was so. 25And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 26And God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ 27And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. 28And God blessed them; and God said unto them: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ 29And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food; 30and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a
<br> 
<br>living soul, [I have given] every green herb for food.’ And it was so. 31And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
<br>And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. 3And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in
<br>creating had made.
<br>4These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
<br>5No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground; 6but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. 9And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good
<br> 
<br>and evil. 10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. 11The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. 14And the name of the third river is aTigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 15And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: ‘Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; 17but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’
<br>18And the LORD God said: ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.’ 19And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. 20And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there

<br>was not found a help meet for him. 21And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. 22And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. 23And the man said: ‘This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called bWoman, because she was taken out of cMan.’ 24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. 25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<br>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which
<br>the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: ‘Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’ 2And the woman said unto the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.’ 4And the serpent said unto the woman: ‘Ye shall not surely die; 5for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.’ 6And when the woman saw that the tree was good
<br>
<br>b Heb. Issahah.
<br>c Heb. Ish.
<br> 
<br>for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. 7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig- leaves together, and made themselves girdles. 8And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: ‘Where art thou?’ 10And he said: ‘I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.’ 11And He said: ‘Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?’ 12And the man said: ‘The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.’ 13And the LORD God said unto the woman: ‘What is this thou hast done?’ And the woman said: ‘The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.’ 14And the LORD God said unto the serpent: ‘Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. 15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
<br> 
<br>and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.’
<br>16Unto the woman He said: ‘I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.’
<br>17And unto Adam He said: ‘Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. 18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. 19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.’ 20And the man called his wife’s name aEve; because she was the mother of all living. 21And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.
<br>22And the LORD God said: ‘Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.’ 23Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming
<br>
<br>a Heb. Havvah, that is, Life.
<br> 
<br>sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.
<br>And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain,
<br>and said: ‘I have agotten a man with the help of the LORD.’ 2And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering; 5but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.’ 8And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<br>9And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ And he said: ‘I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?’ 10And He said: ‘What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground. 11And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth
<br>
<br>a Heb. Kanah, to get.
<br> 
<br>to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand. 12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.’ 13And Cain said unto the LORD: ‘My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.’ 15And the LORD said unto him: ‘Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.’ And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
<br>16And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of bNod, on the east of Eden. 17And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. 18And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot cMehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech. 19And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 20And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. 21And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the
<br>
<br>b That is, Wandering.
<br>c Heb. Mehijael.
<br> 
<br>harp and pipe. 22And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 23And Lamech said unto his wives:
<br>Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
<br>Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech;
<br>For I have slain a man for wounding me,
<br>And a young man for bruising me;
<br>24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
<br>Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
<br>25And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name aSeth: ‘for God bhath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.’ 26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. This	is	the	book	of	the generations of Adam. In the day
<br>that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him; 2male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth. 4And the days of Adam after he begot Seth were eight hundred years;
<br>
<br>a Heb. Sheth.
<br>b Heb. Shath.
<br> 
<br>21And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begot Methuselah. 22And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 23And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years. 24And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.
<br>25And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begot Lamech. 26And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begot sons and daughters. 27And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
<br>28And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begot a son. 29And he called his name Noah, saying: ‘This same shall acomfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh from the ground which the LORD hath cursed.’ 30And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begot sons and daughters. 31And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
<br>32And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<br>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
<br>the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
<br>
<br>a Heb. nahem, to comfort.
<br> 
<br>fair; and they took them wives, whomsoever they chose. 3And the LORD said: ‘My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.’ 4The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
<br>5And the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6And it repented the LORD that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. 7And the LORD said: ‘I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and creeping thing, and fowl of the air; for it repenteth Me that I have made them.’ 8But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
<br>נח
<br>9These are the generations of Noah. Noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God. 10And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
<br> 
<br>13And God said unto Noah: ‘The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; with rooms shalt thou make the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 15And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 17And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall perish. 18But I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’wives with thee. 19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.’ 22Thus did Noah; according
<br> 
<br>to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<br>And the LORD said unto Noah: ‘Come thou and all thy house into
<br>the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation. 2Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, each with his mate; and of the beasts that are not clean two [and two], each with his mate; 3of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I blot out from off the face of the earth.’ 5And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
<br>6And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground, 9there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 10And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were
<br> 
<br>opened. 12And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
<br>13In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort. 15And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. 16And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and the LORD shut him in. 17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. 18And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. 20Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth, and every man; 22all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, whatsoever was in the dry land, died. 23And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of
<br> 
<br>the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; and they were blotted out from the earth; and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. 24And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
<br>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing,   and   all   the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; 2the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. 3And the waters returned from off the earth continually; and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. 4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains
<br>seen.
<br>6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. 7And he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. 9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth; and he put forth his hand,
<br> 
<br>and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. 10And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 11And the dove came in to him at eventide; and lo in her mouth an olive-leaf freshly plucked; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.
<br>13And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dried. 14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
<br>15And God spoke unto Noah, saying: 16’Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’wives with thee. 17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may swarm in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.’ 18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’wives with him; 19every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families; went forth out of the ark.
<br>20And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
<br> 
<br>beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. 21And the LORD smelled the sweet savour; and the LORD said in His heart: ‘I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.’
<br>And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they delivered. 3Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. 4Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man. 6Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man. 7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; swarm in the earth, and multiply
<br>therein.’
<br> 
<br>8And God spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying: 9’As for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 10and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 11And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.’ 12And God said: ‘This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth. 14And it shall come to pass, when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud, 15that I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.’ 17And God said unto Noah: ‘This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.’
<br>18And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and
<br> 
<br>Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. 19These three were the sons of Noah, and of these was the whole earth overspread.
<br>20And Noah the husbandman began, and planted a vineyard. 21And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness. 24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. 25And he said:
<br>Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
<br>26And he said:
<br>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem;
<br>And let Canaan be their servant.
<br>27God aenlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
<br>And let Canaan be their servant.
<br>28And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
<br>
<br>Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem,
<br>
<br> 
<br>a Heb. Japhth.
<br> 
<br>Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood. 2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 3And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 4And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
<br>6And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 7And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. 8And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 9He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said: ‘Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.’ 10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 11Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, 12and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—the same is the great city. 13And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 14and Pathrusim, and Casluhim—whence went forth the Philistines—and Caphtorim.
<br>15And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 16and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 17and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and
<br> 
<br>the Sinite; 18and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 19And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 20These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
<br>21And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 22The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 23And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 24And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber. 25And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was aPeleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 26And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; 27and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; 28and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; 29and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 30And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east. 31These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, Division.
<br> 
<br>32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
<br>And the whole earth was of one   language   and   of   one
<br>speech. 2And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 3And they said one to another: ‘Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.’ And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 4And they said: ‘Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.’ 5And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 6And the LORD said: ‘Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. 7Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.’ 8So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. 9Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there aconfound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>a Heb. Balal, to confound.
<br> 
<br>scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
<br>
<br>10These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood. 11And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>12And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah. 13And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>14And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. 15And Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg. 17And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. 19And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug. 21And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>22And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. 23And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah. 25And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred
<br> 
<br>and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>26And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 27Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. 28And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 30And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.

<br>Now	the	LORD	said	unto Abram: ‘Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee. 2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing. 3And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 4So Abram went, as the LORD had
<br> 
<br>spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. 7And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: ‘Unto thy seed will I give this land’; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 8And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth- el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 9And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
<br>10And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. 11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: ‘Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon. 12And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive. 13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my
<br> 
<br>soul may live because of thee.’ 14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 15And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 16And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. 17And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife. 18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: ‘What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 19Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.’ 20And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
<br>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all
<br>that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. 2And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 3And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai; 4unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first; and Abram called there on the name of the LORD. 5And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 6And the
<br> 
<br>land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 7And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. 8And Abram said unto Lot: ‘Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren. 9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.’ 10And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar. 11So Lot chose him all the plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the other. 12Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 13Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the LORD exceedingly. 14And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him: ‘Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward; 15for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
<br> 
<br>seed for ever. 16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. 17Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.’ 18And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
<br>And it came to pass in the days   of   Amraphel   king   of
<br>Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 2that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela—the same is Zoar. 3All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim—the same is the Salt Sea. 4Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh- kiriathaim, 6and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. 7And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat—the same is Kadesh—and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of
<br> 
<br>Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela—the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim; 9against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 10Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. 11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 12And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. 13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew—now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. 14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. 15And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. 17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of
<br> 
<br>Shaveh—the same is the King’s Vale. 18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High. 19And he blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; 20and blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.’ And he gave him a tenth of all. 21And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: ‘Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.’ 22And Abram said to the king of Sodom: ‘I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, 23that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich; 24save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.’
<br>After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in
<br>a vision, saying: ‘Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.’ 2And Abram said: ‘O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?’ 3And Abram said: ‘Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in my house is to be mine heir.’ 4And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: ‘This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
<br> 
<br>thine own bowels shall be thine heir.’ 5And He brought him forth abroad, and said: ‘Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them’; and He said unto him: ‘So shall thy seed be.’ 6And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness. 7And He said unto him: ‘I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.’ 8And he said: ‘O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?’ 9And He said unto him: ‘Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she- goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.’ 10And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds divided he not. 11And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. 12And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. 13And He said unto Abram: ‘Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 14and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 15But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 16And in the fourth generation they shall come back  hither; for  the
<br> 
<br>iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.’ 17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. 18In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: ‘Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; 19the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, 20and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, 21and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.’
<br>Now Sarai Abram’s wife bore him no children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 2And Sarai said unto Abram: ‘Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing; go in,  I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall be builded up through her.’ And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 3And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 5And Sarai said unto Abram: ‘My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.’ 6But Abram said unto Sarai: ‘Behold,
<br> 
<br>thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes.’ And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face. 7And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 8And he said: ‘Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?’ And she said: ‘I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.’ 9And the angel of the LORD said unto her: ‘Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.’ 10And the angel of the LORD said unto her: ‘I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. 11And the angel of the LORD said unto her: ‘Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name aIshmael, because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. 12And he shall be a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.’ 13And she called the name of the LORD that spoke unto her, Thou art ba God of seeing; for she said: ‘Have I even here seen Him that seeth Me?’ 14Wherefore the well was called cBeer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 15And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son,
<br>
<br>a That is, God heareth.
<br>b Heb. El roi.
<br>c That is, The well of the Living One who seeth me.
<br> 
<br>whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 16And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
<br>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him: ‘I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou wholehearted. 2And I will make My covenant between Me and thee,		and	will			multiply		thee exceedingly.’ 3And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying: 4’As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be athe father of a multitude of nations. 5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram,		but	thy		name	shall		be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. 6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 7And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. 8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all	the		land		of	Canaan,		for		an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.’ 9And God said unto Abraham: ‘And as for thee, thou shalt keep My covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations. 10This is My covenant, which ye shall
