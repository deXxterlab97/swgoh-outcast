<br>(2) Rules relating to premarket notification submissions
<br>(A) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "small business" means an entity that reported $100,000,000 or less of gross receipts or sales in its most recent Federal income tax return for a taxable year, including such returns of all of its affiliates.
<br>(B) Evidence of qualification
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>An applicant shall pay the higher fees established by the Secretary each year unless the applicant submits evidence that it qualifies for the lower fee rate.
<br>(ii) Firms submitting tax returns to the United States Internal Revenue Service
<br>
<br>The applicant shall support its claim that it meets the definition under subparagraph (A) by submission of a copy of its most recent Federal income tax return for a taxable year, and a copy of such returns of its affiliates, which show an amount of gross sales or receipts that is less than the maximum established in subparagraph (A). The applicant, and each of such affiliates, shall certify that the information provided is a true and accurate copy of the actual tax forms they submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. If no tax forms are submitted for any affiliate, the applicant shall certify that the applicant has no affiliates.
<br>(iii) Firms not submitting tax returns to the United States Internal Revenue Service
<br>
<br>In the case of an applicant that has not previously submitted a Federal income tax return, the applicant and each of its affiliates shall demonstrate that it meets the definition under subparagraph (A) by submission of a signed certification, in such form as the Secretary may direct through a notice published in the Federal Register, that the applicant or affiliate meets the criteria for a small business and a certification, in English, from the national taxing authority of the country in which the applicant or, if applicable, affiliate is headquartered. The certification from such taxing authority shall bear the official seal of such taxing authority and shall provide the applicant's or affiliate's gross receipts or sales for the most recent year in both the local currency of such country and in United States dollars, the exchange rate used in converting such local currency to dollars, and the dates during which these receipts or sales were collected. The applicant shall also submit a statement signed by the head of the applicant's firm or by its chief financial officer that the applicant has submitted certifications for all of its affiliates, or that the applicant has no affiliates.
<br>(C) Reduced fees
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2008 and each subsequent fiscal year, where the Secretary finds that the applicant involved meets the definition under subparagraph (A), the fee for a premarket notification submission may be paid at 25 percent of the fee that applies under subsection (a)(2)(A)(viii), and as established under subsection (c)(1).
<br>(D) Request for reduction
<br>
<br>An applicant seeking a fee reduction under this subsection shall submit supporting information to the Secretary at least 60 days before the fee is required pursuant to subsection (a). The decision of the Secretary regarding whether an entity qualifies for such a reduction is not reviewable.
<br>(f) Effect of failure to pay fees
<br>(1) No acceptance of submissions
<br>
<br>A premarket application, premarket report, supplement, premarket notification submission, 30-day notice, request for classification information, periodic reporting concerning a class III device, or de novo classification request submitted by a person subject to fees under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted by the Secretary until all such fees owed by such person have been paid.
<br>(2) No registration
<br>
<br>Registration information submitted under section 360 of this title by an establishment subject to a registration fee shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted by the Secretary until the registration fee under subsection (a)(3) owed for the establishment has been paid. Until the fee is paid and the registration is complete, the establishment is deemed to have failed to register in accordance with section 360 of this title.
<br>(g) Conditions
<br>(1) Performance goals; termination of program
<br>
<br>With respect to the amount that, under the salaries and expenses account of the Food and Drug Administration, is appropriated for a fiscal year for devices and radiological products, fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for the fiscal year, and the Secretary is not expected to meet any performance goals identified for the fiscal year, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount so appropriated for the fiscal year, excluding the amount of fees appropriated for the fiscal year, is more than 1 percent less than $320,825,000 multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to such fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(B) fees were not assessed under subsection (a) for the previous fiscal year.
<br>(2) Authority
<br>
<br>If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate for premarket applications, supplements, premarket reports, premarket notification submissions, 30-day notices, requests for classification information, periodic reporting concerning a class III device, and establishment registrations at any time in such fiscal year, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>
<br>Beginning on October 1, 2023, the authorities under section 379i(9)(C) of this title shall include only leasing and necessary scientific equipment.
<br>(h) Crediting and availability of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of device applications.
<br>(2) Collections and appropriation acts
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The fees authorized by this section—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to subparagraph (C), shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation, for such fiscal year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of device applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2009 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
<br>(B) Compliance
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of device applications—
<br>
<br>(I) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
<br>
<br>(II)(aa) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for a subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in such subparagraph; and
<br>
<br>(bb) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in such subparagraph.
<br>(ii) More than 5 percent
<br>
<br>To the extent such costs are more than 5 percent below the specified level in subparagraph (A)(ii), fees may not be collected under this section for that fiscal year.
<br>(C) Provision for early payments
<br>
<br>Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.
<br>(3) Authorizations of appropriations
<br>
<br>For each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount specified under subsection (b)(3) for the fiscal year, as adjusted under subsection (c).
<br>(i) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
<br>(j) Written requests for refunds
<br>
<br>To qualify for consideration for a refund under subsection (a)(2)(D), a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.
<br>(k) Construction
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of device applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.

The Secretary shall have the sole discretion to refund the fee under this paragraph. A determination by the Secretary concerning a refund under this paragraph shall not be reviewable.
<br>(2) Animal drug product fee
<br>(A) In general
<br>

<br>(B) Payment; fee due date
<br>
<br>The annual establishment fee shall be assessed in each fiscal year in which the animal drug product named in the application is assessed a fee under paragraph (2) unless the animal drug establishment listed in the application does not engage in the manufacture of the animal drug product during the fiscal year. The fee under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall be due upon the later of—

<br>
<br>(ii) who, after September 1, 2003, had pending before the Secretary an animal drug application, a supplemental animal drug application, or an investigational animal drug submission,
<br>
<br>shall be assessed an annual sponsor fee as established under subsection (c).

<br>
<br>(ii) January 31 of each year.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>Each animal drug sponsor shall pay only one such fee each fiscal year.
<br>(b) Fee revenue amounts
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g)—
<br>
<br>(A) for fiscal year 2019, the fees required under subsection (a) shall be established to generate a total revenue amount of $30,331,240; and
<br>
<br>(B) for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023, the fees required under subsection (a) shall be established to generate a total revenue amount of $29,931,240.
<br>(2) Types of fees
<br>
<br>Of the total revenue amount established for a fiscal year under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) 20 percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(1) (relating to animal drug applications and supplements);
<br>
<br>(B) 27 percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(2) (relating to animal drug products);

<br>(c) Annual fee setting; adjustments
<br>(1) Annual fee setting
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish, 60 days before the start of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2003, for that fiscal year, animal drug application fees, supplemental animal drug application fees, animal drug sponsor fees, animal drug establishment fees, and animal drug product fees based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection.
<br>(2) Inflation adjustment
<br>
<br>(A) For fiscal year 2020 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenue amounts established in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, by multiplying such revenue amounts by an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) one;
<br>
<br>(ii) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available, multiplied by the average proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC–MD–VA–WV; not seasonally adjusted; all items less food and energy; annual index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years for which data are available multiplied by the average proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available.
<br>
<br>(B) Compounded basis.—The adjustment made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020 under this paragraph shall be applied on a compounded basis to the revenue amount calculated under this paragraph for the most recent previous fiscal year.
<br>(3) Workload adjustments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2020 and subsequent fiscal years, after the fee revenue amounts established under subsection (b) are adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (2), the fee revenue amounts shall be further adjusted for such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process for the review of animal drug applications, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C). With respect to such adjustment—
<br>
<br>(i) such adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications for which data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required, manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications, investigational animal drug study submissions, and investigational animal drug protocol submissions submitted to the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from such adjustment and the supporting methodologies.
<br>(B) Reduction of workload-based increase by amount of certain excess collections
<br>
<br>For each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023, if application of the workload adjustment under subparagraph (A) increases the fee revenue amounts otherwise established for the fiscal year under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2), such fee revenue increase shall be reduced by the amount of any excess collections, as described in subsection (g)(4), for the second preceding fiscal year, up to the amount of such fee revenue increase.
<br>(C) Rule of application
<br>
<br>Under no circumstances shall the workload adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2).
<br>(4) Final year adjustment
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2023, the Secretary may, in addition to other adjustments under this subsection, further increase the fees under this section, if such an adjustment is necessary, to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of animal drug applications for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2024. If the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the process for the review of animal drug applications in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment will not be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice setting fees for fiscal year 2023.
<br>(5) Limit
<br>
<br>The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications.
<br>(d) Fee waiver or reduction; exemptions from fees
<br>(1) Waiver or reduction
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances;
<br>
<br>(B) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for the review of animal drug applications for such person;
<br>
<br>(C) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for use of the animal drug in—
<br>
<br>(i) a Type B medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(3) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation)) intended for use in the manufacture of Type C free-choice medicated feeds; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a Type C free-choice medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(4) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation));
<br>
<br>(D) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication; or
<br>
<br>(E) the sponsor involved is a small business submitting its first animal drug application to the Secretary for review.
<br>(2) Use of standard costs
<br>
<br>In making the finding in paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary may use standard costs.
<br>(3) Rules for small businesses
<br>(A) Definition
<br>
<br>In paragraph (1)(E), the term "small business" means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates.
<br>(B) Waiver of application fee
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(E) the application fee for the first animal drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent animal drug applications and supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or effectiveness data are required in the same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small business.
<br>(C) Certification
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require any person who applies for a waiver under paragraph (1)(E) to certify their qualification for the waiver. The Secretary shall periodically publish in the Federal Register a list of persons making such certifications.
<br>(4) Exemptions from fees
<br>(A) Certain labeling supplements to add number of approved application
<br>
<br>Fees under this section shall not apply with respect to any person who—
<br>
<br>(i) not later than September 30, 2023, submits a supplemental animal drug application relating to a new animal drug application approved under section 360b of this title, solely to add the new animal drug application number to the labeling of the drug in the manner specified in section 352(w)(3) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) otherwise would be subject to fees under this section solely on the basis of such supplemental application.
<br>(B) Certain animal drug applications
<br>
<br>Fees under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any person who is the named applicant or sponsor of an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission if such application or submission involves the intentional genomic alteration of an animal that is intended to produce a drug, device, or biological product subject to fees under section 379h, 379j, 379j–42, or 379j–52 of this title.
<br>(e) Effect of failure to pay fees
<br>
<br>An animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. An investigational animal drug submission under section 379j–11(5)(B) of this title that is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. The Secretary may discontinue review of any animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application or investigational animal drug submission from a person if such person has not submitted for payment all fees owed under this section by 30 days after the date upon which they are due.
<br>(f) Assessment of fees
<br>(1) Limitation
<br>
<br>Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2003 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
<br>(2) Authority
<br>
<br>If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications, investigational animal drug submissions, animal drug sponsors, animal drug establishments and animal drug products at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.
<br>(g) Crediting and availability of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of animal drug applications.
<br>(2) Collections and appropriation Acts
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The fees authorized by this section—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to subparagraph (C), shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2003 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
<br>(B) Compliance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications—
<br>
<br>(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and
<br>
<br>(II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(C) Provision for early payments
<br>
<br>Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.
<br>(3) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>For each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount established under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c) and paragraph (5).
<br>(4) Excess collections
<br>
<br>If the sum total of fees collected under this section for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of fees authorized to be appropriated for such year under paragraph (3), the excess collections shall be credited to the appropriations account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1).
<br>(5) Recovery of collection shortfalls
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (B)—
<br>
<br>(i) for fiscal year 2021, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal year 2019 falls below the amount of fees authorized for fiscal year 2019 under paragraph (3);
<br>
<br>(ii) for fiscal year 2022, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal year 2020 falls below the amount of fees authorized for fiscal year 2020 under paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(iii) for fiscal year 2023, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the cumulative amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (including estimated collections for fiscal year 2022) falls below the cumulative amount of fees authorized for such fiscal years under paragraph (3).
<br>(B) Reduction of shortfall-based fee increase by prior year excess collections
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall, in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, reduce any fee increase otherwise applicable for a fiscal year under subparagraph (A) by the amount of any excess collections under this section for preceding fiscal years (after fiscal year 2018).
<br>(ii) Workload-based fee accounting
<br>
<br>In applying clause (i), the Secretary shall account for the reduction of workload-based fee revenue increases by excess collections under subsection (c)(3)(B), in such manner as needed to provide that no portion of any excess collections described in clause (i) is applied for purposes of reducing fee increases under both such subsection (c)(3)(B) and this paragraph.
<br>(C) Rule of application
<br>
<br>Under no circumstances shall adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established in subsection (b), as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c).
<br>(h) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
<br>(i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds
<br>
<br>To qualify for consideration for a waiver or reduction under subsection (d), or for a refund of any fee collected in accordance with subsection (a), a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.
<br>(j) Construction
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of animal drug applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.
<br>(k) Abbreviated new animal drug applications
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) to the extent practicable, segregate the review of abbreviated new animal drug applications from the process for the review of animal drug applications; and
<br>
<br>(2) adopt other administrative procedures to ensure that review times of abbreviated new animal drug applications do not increase from their current level due to activities under the user fee program.

<br>"(A) such adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications for which data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required, manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications, investigational animal drug study submissions, and investigational animal drug protocol submissions submitted to the Secretary;
<br>
<br>"(B) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from such adjustment and the supporting methodologies; and
<br>
<br>"(C) under no circumstances shall such adjustment result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established in subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2)."
