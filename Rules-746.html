<br>(b) Rules to establish reasonable testing programs
<br>
<br>The Commission may by rule prescribe reasonable testing programs for any product which is subject to a consumer product safety rule under this chapter, or a similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission, and for which a certificate is required under subsection (a). Any test or testing program on the basis of which a certificate is issued under subsection (a) may, at the option of the person required to certify the product, be conducted by an independent third party qualified to perform such tests, unless the Commission, by rule, requires testing by an independent third party for a particular rule, regulation, standard, or ban, or for a particular class of products.
<br>(c) Form and contents of labels
<br>
<br>The Commission may by rule require the use and prescribe the form and content of labels which contain the following information (or that portion of it specified in the rule)—

<br>
<br>(2) The cohort information (including the batch, run number, or other identifying characteristic) of the product.
<br>
<br>(3) A suitable identification of the manufacturer of the consumer product, unless the product bears a private label in which case it shall identify the private labeler and shall also contain a code mark which will permit the seller of such product to identify the manufacturer thereof to the purchaser upon his request.
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety rule, a certification that the product meets all applicable consumer product safety standards and a specification of the standards which are applicable.
<br>
<br>Such labels, where practicable, may be required by the Commission to be permanently marked on or affixed to any such consumer product. The Commission may, in appropriate cases, permit information required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection to be coded.
<br>(d) Additional regulations for third party testing
<br>(1) Audit
<br>
<br>Not later than 10 months after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall by regulation establish requirements for the periodic audit of third party conformity assessment bodies as a condition for the continuing accreditation of such conformity assessment bodies under subsection (a)(3)(C).

<br>(3) Reducing third party testing burdens
<br>(A) Assessment
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall seek public comment on opportunities to reduce the cost of third party testing requirements consistent with assuring compliance with any applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation. The request for public comment shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(i) The extent to which the use of materials subject to regulations of another government agency that requires third party testing of those materials may provide sufficient assurance of conformity with an applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation without further third party testing.
<br>
<br>(ii) The extent to which modification of the certification requirements may have the effect of reducing redundant third party testing by or on behalf of 2 or more importers of a product that is substantially similar or identical in all material respects.
<br>
<br>(iii) The extent to which products with a substantial number of different components subject to third party testing may be evaluated to show compliance with an applicable rule, ban, standard, or regulation by third party testing of a subset of such components selected by a third party conformity assessment body.
<br>
<br>(iv) The extent to which manufacturers with a substantial number of substantially similar products subject to third party testing may reasonably make use of sampling procedures that reduce the overall test burden without compromising the benefits of third party testing.
<br>
<br>(v) The extent to which evidence of conformity with other national or international governmental standards may provide assurance of conformity to consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, or regulations applicable under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(vi) The extent to which technology, other than the technology already approved by the Commission, exists for third party conformity assessment bodies to test or to screen for testing consumer products subject to a third party testing requirement.
<br>
<br>(vii) Other techniques for lowering the cost of third party testing consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations.
<br>(B) Regulations
<br>
<br>Following the public comment period described in subparagraph (A), but not later than 1 year after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall review the public comments and may prescribe new or revised third party testing regulations if it determines that such regulations will reduce third party testing costs consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations.
<br>(C) Report
<br>
<br>If the Commission determines that it lacks authority to implement an opportunity for reducing the costs of third-party testing consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations, it shall transmit a report to Congress reviewing those opportunities, along with any recommendations for any legislation to permit such implementation.
<br>(4) Special rules for small batch manufacturers
<br>(A) Special consideration; exemption
<br>(i) Consideration; alternative requirements
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (C), in implementing third party testing requirements under this section, the Commission shall take into consideration any economic, administrative, or other limits on the ability of small batch manufacturers to comply with such requirements and shall, after notice and a hearing, provide alternative testing requirements for covered products manufactured by small batch manufacturers in lieu of those required under subsection (a) or (b). Any such alternative requirements shall provide for reasonable methods to assure compliance with any applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation. The Commission may allow such alternative testing requirements for small batch manufacturers with respect to a specific product or product class or with respect to a specific safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion thereof.
<br>(ii) Exemption
<br>
<br>If the Commission determines that no alternative testing requirement is available or economically practicable, it shall exempt small batch manufacturers from third party testing requirements under subsections (a) and (b).
<br>(iii) Certification
<br>
<br>In lieu of or as part of any alternative testing requirements provided under clause (i), the Commission may allow certification of a product to an applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion thereof, based on documentation that the product complies with another national or international governmental standard or safety requirement that the Commission determines is the same or more stringent than the consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion thereof. Any such certification shall only be allowed to the extent of the equivalency with a consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation and not to any other part of the consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation.
<br>(iv) Restriction
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), and except where the Commission determines that the manufacturer does not meet the definition of a small batch manufacturer, for any small batch manufacturer registered pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Commission may not require third party testing of a covered product by a third party conformity assessment body until the Commission has provided either an alternative testing requirement or an exemption in accordance with clause (i) or (ii), respectively.
<br>(B) Registration
<br>
<br>Any small batch manufacturer that utilizes alternative requirements or an exemption under this paragraph shall register with the Commission prior to using such alternative requirements or exemptions pursuant to any guidelines issued by the Commission to carry out this requirement.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>The Commission shall not provide or permit to continue in effect any alternative requirements or exemption from third party testing requirements under this paragraph where it determines, based on notice and a hearing, that full compliance with subsection (a) or (b) is reasonably necessary to protect public health or safety. The Commission shall not provide any alternative requirements or exemption for—
<br>
<br>(i) any of the third party testing requirements described in clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (a)(3)(B); or
<br>
<br>(ii) durable infant or toddler products, as defined in section 2056a(f) of this title.
<br>(D) Subsequent manufacturer
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect third party testing or any other requirements with respect to a subsequent manufacturer or other entity that uses components provided by one or more small batch manufacturers.

<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) the term "covered product" means a consumer product manufactured by a small batch manufacturer where no more than 7,500 units of the same product were manufactured in the previous calendar year; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the term "small batch manufacturer" means a manufacturer that had no more than $1,000,000 in total gross revenue from sales of all consumer products in the previous calendar year. The dollar amount contained in this paragraph shall be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the total gross revenue for all sales of all consumer products of a manufacturer under this subparagraph, such total gross revenue shall be considered to include all gross revenue from all sales of all consumer products of each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such manufacturer. The Commission shall take steps to ensure that all relevant business affiliations are considered in determining whether or not a manufacturer meets this definition.

<br>§2064. Substantial product hazards
<br>(a) "Substantial product hazard" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "substantial product hazard" means—
<br>
<br>(1) a failure to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule under this chapter or a similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission which creates a substantial risk of injury to the public, or
<br>
<br>(2) a product defect which (because of the pattern of defect, the number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severity of the risk, or otherwise) creates a substantial risk of injury to the public.
<br>(b) Noncompliance with applicable consumer product safety rules; product defects; notice to Commission by manufacturer, distributor, or retailer
<br>
<br>Every manufacturer of a consumer product, or other product or substance over which the Commission has jurisdiction under any other Act enforced by the Commission (other than motor vehicle equipment as defined in section 30102(a)(7) of title 49 1), distributed in commerce, and every distributor and retailer of such product, who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that such product—
<br>
<br>(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 2058 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) fails to comply with any other rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter or any other Act enforced by the Commission;
<br>
<br>(3) contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard described in subsection (a)(2); or
<br>
<br>(4) creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death,
<br>
<br>shall immediately inform the Commission of such failure to comply, of such defect, or of such risk, unless such manufacturer, distributor, or retailer has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of such defect, failure to comply, or such risk. A report provided under paragraph (2) may not be used as the basis for criminal prosecution of the reporting person under section 1264 of this title, except for offenses which require a showing of intent to defraud or mislead.
<br>(c) Notice of defect or failure to comply; mail notice
<br>
<br>(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification is required in order to adequately protect the public from such substantial product hazard, or if the Commission, after notifying the manufacturer, determines a product to be an imminently hazardous consumer product and has filed an action under section 2061 of this title, the Commission may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of the product to take any one or more of the following actions:
<br>
<br>(A) To cease distribution of the product.
<br>
<br>(B) To notify all persons that transport, store, distribute, or otherwise handle the product, or to which the product has been transported, sold, distributed, or otherwise handled, to cease immediately distribution of the product.
<br>
<br>(C) To notify appropriate State and local public health officials.
<br>
<br>(D) To give public notice of the defect or failure to comply, including posting clear and conspicuous notice on its Internet website, providing notice to any third party Internet website on which such manufacturer, retailer, distributor, or licensor has placed the product for sale, and announcements in languages other than English and on radio and television where the Commission determines that a substantial number of consumers to whom the recall is directed may not be reached by other notice.
<br>
<br>(E) To mail notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product.
<br>
<br>(F) To mail notice to every person to whom the person required to give notice knows such product was delivered or sold.
<br>
<br>Any such order shall specify the form and content of any notice required to be given under such order.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission may require a notice described in paragraph (1) to be distributed in a language other than English if the Commission determines that doing so is necessary to adequately protect the public.
<br>
<br>(3) If a district court determines, in an action filed under section 2061 of this title, that the product that is the subject of such action is not an imminently hazardous consumer product, the Commission shall rescind any order issued under this subsection with respect to such product.
<br>(d) Repair; replacement; refunds; action plan
<br>
<br>(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested parties, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f)) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that action under this subsection is in the public interest, it may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of such product to provide the notice required by subsection (c) and to take any one or more of the following actions it determines to be in the public interest:
<br>
<br>(A) To bring such product into conformity with the requirements of the applicable rule, regulation, standard, or ban or to repair the defect in such product.
<br>
<br>(B) To replace such product with a like or equivalent product which complies with the applicable rule, regulation, standard, or ban or which does not contain the defect.
<br>
<br>(C) To refund the purchase price of such product (less a reasonable allowance for use, if such product has been in the possession of a consumer for one year or more (i) at the time of public notice under subsection (c), or (ii) at the time the consumer receives actual notice of the defect or noncompliance, whichever first occurs).
<br>
<br>(2) An order under this subsection shall also require the person to whom it applies to submit a plan, for approval by the Commission, for taking action under whichever of the preceding subparagraphs under which such person has been ordered to act. The Commission shall specify in the order the persons to whom refunds must be made if the Commission orders the action described in subparagraph (C).2 An order under this subsection may prohibit the person to whom it applies from manufacturing for sale, offering for sale, distributing in commerce, or importing into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or from doing any combination of such actions, the product with respect to which the order was issued.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the Commission approves an action plan, it shall indicate its approval in writing.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Commission finds that an approved action plan is not effective or appropriate under the circumstances, or that the manufacturer, retailer, or distributor is not executing an approved action plan effectively, the Commission may, by order, amend, or require amendment of, the action plan. In determining whether an approved plan is effective or appropriate under the circumstances, the Commission shall consider whether a repair or replacement changes the intended functionality of the product.
<br>
<br>(C) If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for comment, that a manufacturer, retailer, or distributor has failed to comply substantially with its obligations under its action plan, the Commission may revoke its approval of the action plan. The manufacturer, retailer, or distributor to which the action plan applies may not distribute in commerce the product to which the action plan relates after receipt of notice of a revocation of the action plan.
<br>(e) Reimbursement
<br>
<br>(1) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under an order issued under subsection (d), and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy.
<br>
<br>(2) An order issued under subsection (c) or (d) with respect to a product may require any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the product to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out the order, if the Commission determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest.
<br>(f) Hearing
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an order under subsection (c) or (d) may be issued only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 except that, if the Commission determines that any person who wishes to participate in such hearing is a part of a class of participants who share an identity of interest, the Commission may limit such person's participation in such hearing to participation through a single representative designated by such class (or by the Commission if such class fails to designate such a representative). Any settlement offer which is submitted to the presiding officer at a hearing under this subsection shall be transmitted by the officer to the Commission for its consideration unless the settlement offer is clearly frivolous or duplicative of offers previously made.
<br>
<br>(2) The requirement for a hearing in paragraph (1) shall not apply to an order issued under subsection (c) or (d) relating to an imminently hazardous consumer product with regard to which the Commission has filed an action under section 2061 of this title.
<br>(g) Preliminary injunction
<br>
<br>(1) If the Commission has initiated a proceeding under this section for the issuance of an order under subsection (d) with respect to a product which the Commission has reason to believe presents a substantial product hazard, the Commission (without regard to section 2076(b)(7) of this title) or the Attorney General may, in accordance with 2061(d)(1) 3 of this title, apply to a district court of the United States for the issuance of a preliminary injunction to restrain the distribution in commerce of such product pending the completion of such proceeding. If such a preliminary injunction has been issued, the Commission (or the Attorney General if the preliminary injunction was issued upon an application of the Attorney General) may apply to the issuing court for extensions of such preliminary injunction.
<br>
<br>(2) Any preliminary injunction, and any extension of a preliminary injunction, issued under this subsection with respect to a product shall be in effect for such period as the issuing court prescribes not to exceed a period which extends beyond the thirtieth day from the date of the issuance of the preliminary injunction (or, in the case of a preliminary injunction which has been extended, the date of its extension) or the date of the completion or termination of the proceeding under this section respecting such product, whichever date occurs first.
<br>
<br>(3) The amount in controversy requirement of section 1331 of title 28 does not apply with respect to the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States to issue or exend 4 a preliminary injunction under this subsection.
<br>(h) Cost-benefit analysis of notification or other action not required
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification or other action under this section should be taken, to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in providing notification or taking other action under this section with the benefits from such notification or action.
<br>(i) Requirements for recall notices
<br>(1) Guidelines
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall, by rule, establish guidelines setting forth a uniform class of information to be included in any notice required under an order under subsection (c) or (d) of this section or under section 2061 of this title. Such guidelines shall include any information that the Commission determines would be helpful to consumers in—
<br>
<br>(A) identifying the specific product that is subject to such an order;
<br>
<br>(B) understanding the hazard that has been identified with such product (including information regarding incidents or injuries known to have occurred involving such product); and
<br>
<br>(C) understanding what remedy, if any, is available to a consumer who has purchased the product.
<br>(2) Content
<br>
<br>Except to the extent that the Commission determines with respect to a particular product that one or more of the following items is unnecessary or inappropriate under the circumstances, the notice shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) description of the product, including—
<br>
<br>(i) the model number or stock keeping unit (SKU) number of the product;
<br>
<br>(ii) the names by which the product is commonly known; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a photograph of the product.
<br>
<br>(B) A description of the action being taken with respect to the product.
<br>
<br>(C) The number of units of the product with respect to which the action is being taken.
<br>
<br>(D) A description of the substantial product hazard and the reasons for the action.
<br>
<br>(E) An identification of the manufacturers and significant retailers of the product.
<br>
<br>(F) The dates between which the product was manufactured and sold.
<br>
<br>(G) The number and a description of any injuries or deaths associated with the product, the ages of any individuals injured or killed, and the dates on which the Commission received information about such injuries or deaths.
<br>
<br>(H) A description of—
<br>
<br>(i) any remedy available to a consumer;
<br>
<br>(ii) any action a consumer must take to obtain a remedy; and
<br>
<br>(iii) any information a consumer needs in order to obtain a remedy or information about a remedy, such as mailing addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses.
<br>
<br>(I) Other information the Commission deems appropriate.
<br>(j) Substantial product hazard list
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may specify, by rule, for any consumer product or class of consumer products, characteristics whose existence or absence shall be deemed a substantial product hazard under subsection (a)(2), if the Commission determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) such characteristics are readily observable and have been addressed by voluntary standards; and
<br>
<br>(B) such standards have been effective in reducing the risk of injury from consumer products and that there is substantial compliance with such standards.
<br>(2) Judicial review
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after promulgation of a rule under paragraph (1), any person adversely affected by such rule may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in section 2060 of this title.

<br>§2066. Imported products
<br>(a) Refusal of admission
<br>
<br>Any consumer product offered for importation into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) shall be refused admission into such customs territory if such product—
<br>
<br>(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule;
<br>
<br>(2) is not accompanied by a certificate required by this chapter or any other Act enforced by the Commission, or is accompanied by a false certificate, if the manufacturer in the exercise of due care has reason to know that the certificate is false or misleading in any material respect, or is not accompanied by any label or certificate (including tracking labels) required under section 2063 of this title or any rule or regulation under such section;
<br>
<br>(3) is or has been determined to be an imminently hazardous consumer product in a proceeding brought under section 2061 of this title;
<br>
<br>(4) has a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard (within the meaning of section 2064(a)(2)) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(5) is a product which was manufactured by a person who the Commission has informed the Secretary of the Treasury is in violation of subsection (g).
<br>(b) Samples
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall obtain without charge and deliver to the Commission, upon the latter's request, a reasonable number of samples of consumer products being offered for import. Except for those owners or consignees who are or have been afforded an opportunity for a hearing in a proceeding under section 2061 of this title with respect to an imminently hazardous product, the owner or consignee of the product shall be afforded an opportunity by the Commission for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 with respect to the importation of such products into the customs territory of the United States. If it appears from examination of such samples or otherwise that a product must be refused admission under the terms of subsection (a), such product shall be refused admission, unless subsection (c) of this section applies and is complied with.
<br>(c) Modification
<br>
<br>If it appears to the Commission that any consumer product which may be refused admission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section can be so modified that it need not (under the terms of paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a)) be refused admission, the Commission may defer final determination as to the admission of such product and, in accordance with such regulations as the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly agree to, permit such product to be delivered from customs custody under bond for the purpose of permitting the owner or consignee an opportunity to so modify such product.
<br>(d) Supervision of modifications
<br>
<br>All actions taken by an owner or consignee to modify such product under subsection (c) shall be subject to the supervision of an officer or employee of the Commission and of the Department of the Treasury. If it appears to the Commission that the product cannot be so modified or that the owner or consignee is not proceeding satisfactorily to modify such product, it shall be refused admission into the customs territory of the United States, and the Commission may direct the Secretary to demand redelivery of the product into customs custody, and to seize the product in accordance with section 2071(b) of this title if it is not so redelivered.
<br>(e) Product destruction
<br>
<br>Products refused admission into the customs territory of the United States shall be destroyed unless, upon application by the owner, consignee, or importer of record, the Secretary of the Treasury permits the export of the product in lieu of destruction. If the owner, consignee, or importer of record does not export the product within 90 days of approval to export, such product shall be destroyed.
<br>(f) Payment of expenses occasioned by refusal of admission
<br>
<br>All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in connection with the destruction provided for in this section (the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury) and all expenses in connection with the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any consumer product refused admission under this section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.
<br>(g) Inspection and recordkeeping requirement
<br>
<br>Manufacturers of imported products shall be in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under section 2065 of this title applicable to such products, and the Commission shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury of any manufacturer who is not in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under section 2065 of this title.
<br>(h) Product surveillance program
<br>
<br>(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a permanent product surveillance program, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, for the purpose of carrying out the Commission's responsibilities under this chapter and the other Acts administered by the Commission and preventing the entry of unsafe consumer products into the commerce of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission may provide to the agencies with which it is cooperating under paragraph (1) such information, data, violator lists, test results, and other support, guidance, and documents as may be necessary or helpful for such agencies to cooperate with the Commission to carry out the product surveillance program under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission shall periodically report to the appropriate Congressional committees the results of the surveillance program under paragraph (1).

Subject to paragraph (2), a violation of section 2068(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (11) of this title shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each consumer product involved, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations. A violation of section 2068(a)(3) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each failure or refusal to allow or perform an act required thereby; and, if such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations.
<br>
<br>(2) The second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to violations of paragraph (1) or (2) of section 2068(a) of this title—
<br>
<br>(A) if the person who violated such paragraphs is not the manufacturer or private labeler or a distributor of the products involved, and

<br>
<br>(B) Not later than December 1, 2011, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately following such publication.
<br>
<br>(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded to—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000;

<br>
<br>(ii) The term "cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years" means the percentage by which—
<br>
<br>(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds
<br>
<br>(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last adjusted.
<br>(b) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of section 2068(a) of this title, the Commission shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, the number of defective products distributed, the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, and such other factors as appropriate.
<br>(c) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty
<br>
<br>Any civil penalty under this section may be compromised by the Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including,1 the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, and the number of defective products distributed, and such other factors as appropriate. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.

<br>
<br>As used in the first sentence of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the term "knowingly" means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care to ascertain the truth of representations.
