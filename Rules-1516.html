<br>(b) Local areas
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Process
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (d), and consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3), in order for a State to receive an allotment under section 3162(b) or 3172(b) of this title, the Governor of the State shall designate local workforce development areas within the State—

<br>(B) Considerations
<br>
<br>The Governor shall designate local areas (except for those local areas described in paragraphs (2) and (3)) based on considerations consisting of the extent to which the areas—

<br>
<br>(iii) have available the Federal and non-Federal resources necessary to effectively administer activities under part B and other applicable provisions of this Act, including whether the areas have the appropriate education and training providers, such as institutions of higher education and area career and technical education schools.

<br>(3) Subsequent designation
<br>

<br>(4) Designation on recommendation of State board
<br>
<br>The Governor may approve a request from any unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) for designation of an area as a local area if the State board determines, based on the considerations described in paragraph (1)(B), and recommends to the Governor, that such area should be so designated.
<br>(5) Areas served by rural concentrated employment programs
<br>
<br>The Governor may approve, under paragraph (2) or (3), a request for designation as a local area from an area described in section 3122(c)(1)(C) of this title.

<br>
<br>A unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) or grant recipient that requests but is not granted designation of an area as a local area under paragraph (2) or (3) may submit an appeal to the State board under an appeal process established in the State plan. If the appeal does not result in such a designation, the Secretary of Labor, after receiving a request for review from the unit or grant recipient and on determining that the unit or grant recipient was not accorded procedural rights under the appeals process described in the State plan, as specified in section 3112(b)(2)(D)(i)(III) of this title, or that the area meets the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), may require that the area be designated as a local area under such paragraph.

<br>(2) Regional plans
<br>
<br>The State, after consultation with local boards and chief elected officials for the planning regions, shall require the local boards and chief elected officials within a planning region to prepare, submit, and obtain approval of a single regional plan that includes a description of the activities described in paragraph (1) and that incorporates local plans for each of the local areas in the planning region.
