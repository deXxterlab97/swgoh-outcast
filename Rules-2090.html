<br>
<br>"(2) Limitation on coastwise trade.—A vessel owned by a person described in paragraph (1) for which a coastwise endorsement is issued under [former] section 12106(e) of title 46, United States Code, may be employed in the coastwise trade only within Alaska and in the coastwise trade to and from Alaska.
<br>
<br>"(3) Termination.—The application of this subsection to a person described in paragraph (1) shall terminate if all of that person's vessels described in paragraph (1) are sold to a person eligible to document vessels under section 12106(a) [now section 12112(a)] of title 46, United States Code."

<br>
<br>(2) was built in the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) if rebuilt, was rebuilt in the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) was not forfeited to the United States Government after July 1, 2001, for a breach of the laws of the United States; and

<br>
<br>(c) Ownership Requirements for Entities.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A vessel owned by an entity is eligible for a fishery endorsement only if at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity, at each tier of ownership and in the aggregate, is owned and controlled by citizens of the United States.

<br>
<br>(3) Exceptions.—This subsection does not apply to a vessel when it is engaged in the fisheries in the exclusive economic zone under the authority of the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council established under section 302(a)(1)(H) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(H)) or to a purse seine vessel when it is engaged in tuna fishing in the Pacific Ocean outside the exclusive economic zone or pursuant to the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Treaty, provided that the owner of the vessel continues to comply with the eligibility requirements for a fishery endorsement under the Federal law that was in effect on October 1, 1998.

<br>
<br>(D) the vessel is a fish tender vessel that is not engaged in the harvesting or processing of fish.
<br>
<br>(e) Vessels Measuring 100 Feet or Greater.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The Administrator of the Maritime Administration shall administer subsections (c) and (d) with respect to vessels 100 feet or greater in registered length. The owner of each such vessel shall file a statement of citizenship setting forth all relevant facts regarding vessel ownership and control with the Administrator on an annual basis to demonstrate compliance with those provisions.

<br>The American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105–277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(i), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Introductory provisions and cl. (i) of subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section were derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109–304, §5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491. As part of that amendment, the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a reference to "such Act" which had been preceded by references to both of the above named Acts.

L. 105–277, Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–625, 2681–627, which is set out in a note under section 1851 of Title 16, Conservation.

<br>In this section, the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Secretary of the Treasury", thereby incorporating the definition of "Secretary" in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b) of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89–670, Oct. 15, 1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section 888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135).
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1), the words "seeking hereunder to document a vessel under the laws of the United States or to operate a vessel exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States" are omitted as unnecessary because of the reorganization of the section.
<br>
<br>Subsection (d)(1)(B) is substituted for "together with their owners or masters, shall be entitled to all the other benefits and privileges and shall be subject to the same requirements, penalties, and forfeitures as may be applicable in the case of vessels built in the United States and otherwise documented or exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d)(2), the words before subparagraph (A) are substituted for "no vessel owned by any such corporation shall engage in the fisheries or in the transportation of merchandise or passengers for hire between points in the United States, including Territories, Districts, and possessions thereof, embraced within the coastwise laws, except" to eliminate unnecessary words. See the definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

<br>In subsection (b), in paragraph (1), the words "satisfies the requirements for a coastwise endorsement, except for the ownership requirement otherwise applicable without regard to this section" are substituted for "otherwise eligible for documentation under this section" in 46 U.S.C. 12106(e)(1)(E) for clarity. Subparagraph (A) of 46 U.S.C. 12106(e)(1) is omitted as redundant to the general requirements in revised section 12112 on coastwise endorsements.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(3), the words "documented with a coastwise endorsement" are substituted for "documented under this section" because former section 12106 is being divided into multiple sections.
<br>
<br>Subsection (e) is substituted for "(3) Upon termination by a demise charterer required under paragraph (1)(C), the coastwise endorsement of the vessel may, in the sole discretion of the Secretary, be continued after the termination for default of the demise charter for a period not to exceed 6 months on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

<br>In subsection (b), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Secretary of Transportation" for consistency in the chapter.
<br>§12139. Reports
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—To ensure compliance with this chapter and laws governing the qualifications of vessels to engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries, the Secretary may require owners, masters, charterers, and mortgagees of documented vessels to submit reports in any reasonable form and manner the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(b) Vessels Rebuilt Outside United States.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a vessel exceeding the tonnage specified in paragraph (2) and documented or last documented under the laws of the United States is rebuilt outside the United States, the owner or master shall submit a report of the rebuilding to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Tonnage.—The tonnage referred to in paragraph (1) is—
<br>
<br>(A) 500 gross tons as measured under section 14502 of this title; or

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Secretary of the Treasury", thereby incorporating the definition of "Secretary" in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b) of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89–670, Oct. 15, 1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section 888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135). The words "rebuilt outside the United States" are substituted for "and any part of the rebuilding, including the construction of major components of the hull and superstructure of the vessel, is not effected within the United States, its Territories (not including trust territories) or its possessions" because of the definition of "rebuilt" in section 12101, and the definition of "United States" in chapter 1, of the revised title.

<br>  	46 App.:883a (2d, last sentences). 	July 14, 1956, ch. 600, §2 (2d, last sentences), 70 Stat. 544; Pub. L. 86–583, §2, July 5, 1960, 74 Stat. 321.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b), in restating 46 App. U.S.C. 883a (2d, last sentences), the penalty of $200 for the owner and master of the vessel is omitted because subsection (a) provides a general civil penalty for violation of this chapter. The authority to remit or mitigate a penalty under section 2107(b) is omitted because section 2107(b) applies to subtitle II and this section is in subtitle II.
