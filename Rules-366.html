<br>Rule 7041. Dismissal of Adversary Proceedings
<br>
<br>Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings, except that a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance without notice to the trustee, the United States trustee, and such other persons as the court may direct, and only on order of the court containing terms and conditions which the court deems proper.
<br>
<br>(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983
<br>
<br>Dismissal of a complaint objecting to a discharge raises special concerns because the plaintiff may have been induced to dismiss by an advantage given or promised by the debtor or someone acting in his interest. Some courts by local rule or order have required the debtor and his attorney or the plaintiff to file an affidavit that nothing has been promised to the plaintiff in consideration of the withdrawal of the objection. By specifically authorizing the court to impose conditions in the order of dismissal this rule permits the continuation of this salutary practice.
<br>
<br>Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 7002 that reference is to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. as incorporated and modified by Rule 7019.
<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
<br>
<br>The United States trustee has standing to object to the debtor's discharge pursuant to §727(c) and may have refrained from commencing an adversary proceeding objecting to discharge within the time limits provided in Rule 4004 only because another party commenced such a proceeding. The United States trustee may oppose dismissal of the original proceeding.
<br>
<br>The rule is also amended to clarify that the court may direct that other persons receive notice of a plaintiff's motion to dismiss a complaint objecting to discharge.

In these proceedings, the reference in Rule 52 F.R.Civ.P. to the entry of judgment under Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. shall be read as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under Rule 5003(a).

<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983
<br>
<br>Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 7002 this reference is to Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. as incorporated and modified by Rule 7012.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended by limiting the time for filing post judgment motions for amended or additional findings. In 2009, Rule 52 F. R. Civ. P. was amended to extend the deadline for filing those post judgment motions to no later than 28 days after entry of the judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F. R. App. P. In a bankruptcy case, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing a motion for amended or additional findings would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to clarify that the reference in Rule 52 F. R. Civ. P. to Rule 58 F. R. Civ. P. and its provisions is construed as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under Rule 5003(a).

<br>Rule 7054. Judgments; Costs
<br>
<br>(a) Judgments. Rule 54(a)–(c) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings.
<br>
<br>(b) Costs; Attorney's Fees.
<br>
<br>(1) Costs Other Than Attorney's Fees. The court may allow costs to the prevailing party except when a statute of the United States or these rules otherwise provides. Costs against the United States, its officers and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on 14 days' notice; on motion served within seven days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.
<br>
<br>(2) Attorney's Fees.
<br>
<br>(A) Rule 54(d)(2)(A)–(C) and (E) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings except for the reference in Rule 54(d)(2)(C) to Rule 78.
<br>
<br>(B) By local rule, the court may establish special procedures to resolve fee-related issues without extensive evidentiary hearings.

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2012 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) is amended to provide more time for a party to respond to the prevailing party's bill of costs. The former rule's provision of one day's notice was unrealistically short. The change to 14 days conforms to the change made to Civil Rule 54(d). Extension from five to seven days of the time for serving a motion for court review of the clerk's action implements changes in connection with the December 1, 2009, amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. Throughout the rules, deadlines have been amended in the following manner:
<br>
<br>• 5-day periods became 7-day periods.
<br>
<br>• 10-day periods became 14-day periods.
<br>
<br>• 15-day periods became 14-day periods.
<br>
<br>• 20-day periods became 21-day periods.
<br>
<br>• 25-day periods became 28-day periods.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) is amended to prescribe the procedure for seeking an award of attorney's fees and related nontaxable expenses in adversary proceedings. It does so by adding new paragraph (2) that incorporates most of the provisions of Rule 54(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. The title of subdivision (b) is amended to reflect the new content, and the previously existing provision governing costs is renumbered as paragraph (1) and re-titled.
<br>
<br>As provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(A), new subsection (b)(2) does not apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract providing for the recovery of fees incurred prior to the instant adversary proceeding. Such fees typically are required to be claimed in a pleading.
<br>
<br>Rule 54(d)(2)(D) F.R.Civ.P. does not apply in adversary proceedings insofar as it authorizes the referral of fee matters to a master or a magistrate judge. The use of masters is not authorized in bankruptcy cases, see Rule 9031, and 28 U.S.C. §636 does not authorize a magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction upon referral by a bankruptcy judge. The remaining provision of Rule 54(d)(2)(D) is expressed in subdivision (b)(2)(B) of this rule.
<br>
<br>Rule 54(d)(2)(C) refers to Rule 78 F.R.Civ.P., which is not applicable in adversary proceedings. Accordingly, that reference is not incorporated by this rule.

<br>
<br>(As amended Apr. 23, 2012, eff. Dec. 1 2012.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2012 Amendment
<br>
<br>The only exception to complete adoption of Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P. involves the default deadline for filing a summary judgment motion. Rule 56(c)(1)(A) makes the default deadline 30 days after the close of all discovery. Because in bankruptcy cases hearings can occur shortly after the close of discovery, a default deadline based on the scheduled hearing date, rather than the close of discovery, is adopted. As with Rule 56(c)(1), the deadline can be altered either by local rule or court order.

<br>
<br>(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 1999, eff. Dec. 1, 1999; Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)

<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
<br>
<br>This rule is amended to include as additional exceptions to Rule 62(a) an order granting relief from the automatic stay of actions against codebtors provided by §1201 of the Code, the sale or lease of property of the estate under §363, and the assumption or assignment of an executory contract under §365.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—1999 Amendment
<br>
<br>The additional exceptions to Rule 62(a) consist of orders that are issued in contested matters. These exceptions are deleted from this rule because of the amendment to Rule 9014 that renders this rule inapplicable in contested matters unless the court orders otherwise. See also the amendments to Rules 3020, 3021, 4001, 6004, and 6006 that delay the implementation of certain types of orders for a period of ten days unless the court otherwise directs.

<br>The rule is amended to retain a 14-day period for the automatic stay of a judgment. F.R.Civ.P. 62(a) now provides for a 30-day stay to accommodate the 28-day time periods under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for filing post-judgment motions and the 30-day period for filing a notice of appeal. Under the Bankruptcy Rules, however, those periods are limited to 14 days. See Rules 7052, 8002, 9015, and 9023.

<br>PART VIII—APPEALS TO DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL 1
<br>
<br>1 The 2014 amendments to Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Rules are comprehensive. Proposed amendment of the heading, "Part VIII. Bankruptcy Appeals", was not transmitted for Congressional review.
<br>Rule 8001. Scope of Part VIII Rules; Definition of "BAP"; Method of Transmission
<br>
<br>(a) General Scope. These Part VIII rules govern the procedure in a United States district court and a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court. They also govern certain procedures on appeal to a United States court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d).
<br>
<br>(b) Definition of "BAP." "BAP" means a bankruptcy appellate panel established by a circuit's judicial council and authorized to hear appeals from a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158.
<br>
<br>(c) Method of Transmitting Documents. A document must be sent electronically under these Part VIII rules, unless it is being sent by or to an individual who is not represented by counsel or the court's governing rules permit or require mailing or other means of delivery.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8001, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to manner of taking appeal, voluntary dismissal, and certification to court of appeals, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>These Part VIII rules apply to appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a) from bankruptcy courts to district courts and BAPs. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure generally govern bankruptcy appeals to courts of appeals.
<br>
<br>Eight of the Part VIII rules do, however, relate to appeals to courts of appeals. Rule 8004(e) provides that the authorization by a court of appeals of a direct appeal of a bankruptcy court's interlocutory order or decree constitutes a grant of leave to appeal. Rule 8006 governs the procedure for certification under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) of a direct appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a court of appeals. Rule 8007 addresses stays pending a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8008 authorizes a bankruptcy court to issue an indicative ruling while an appeal is pending in a court of appeals. Rules 8009 and 8010 govern the record on appeal in a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8025 governs the granting of a stay of a district court or BAP judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals. And Rule 8028 authorizes the court of appeals to suspend applicable Part VIII rules in a particular case, subject to certain enumerated exceptions.
<br>
<br>These rules take account of the evolving technology in the federal courts for the electronic filing, storage, and transmission of documents. Except as applied to pro se parties, the Part VIII rules require documents to be sent electronically, unless applicable court rules or orders expressly require or permit another means of sending a particular document.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8002. Time for Filing Notice of Appeal
<br>
<br>(a) In General.
<br>
<br>(1) Fourteen-Day Period. Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.
<br>
<br>(2) Filing Before the Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed after the bankruptcy court announces a decision or order—but before entry of the judgment, order, or decree—is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.
<br>
<br>(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise allowed by this rule, whichever period ends later.
<br>
<br>(4) Mistaken Filing in Another Court. If a notice of appeal is mistakenly filed in a district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the clerk of that court must state on the notice the date on which it was received and transmit it to the bankruptcy clerk. The notice of appeal is then considered filed in the bankruptcy court on the date so stated.
<br>
<br>(5) Entry Defined.
<br>
<br>(A) A judgment, order, or decree is entered for purposes of this Rule 8002(a):
<br>
<br>(i) when it is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a), or
<br>
<br>(ii) if Rule 7058 applies and Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. requires a separate document, when the judgment, order, or decree is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a) and when the earlier of these events occurs:
<br>
<br>• the judgment, order, or decree is set out in a separate document; or
<br>
<br>• 150 days have run from entry of the judgment, order, or decree in the docket under Rule 5003(a).
<br>
<br>(B) A failure to set out a judgment, order, or decree in a separate document when required by Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment, order, or decree.
<br>
<br>(b) Effect of a Motion on the Time to Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. If a party files in the bankruptcy court any of the following motions and does so within the time allowed by these rules, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:
<br>
<br>(A) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 7052, whether or not granting the motion would alter the judgment;
<br>
<br>(B) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 9023;
<br>
<br>(C) for a new trial under Rule 9023; or
<br>
<br>(D) for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed within 14 days after the judgment is entered.
<br>
<br>(2) Filing an Appeal Before the Motion is Decided. If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree—but before it disposes of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—the notice becomes effective when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.
<br>
<br>(3) Appealing the Ruling on the Motion. If a party intends to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree upon the motion—the party must file a notice of appeal or an amended notice of appeal. The notice or amended notice must comply with Rule 8003 or 8004 and be filed within the time prescribed by this rule, measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.
<br>
<br>(4) No Additional Fee. No additional fee is required to file an amended notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>(c) Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8002(c)(1). If an inmate files a notice of appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:
<br>
<br>(A) it is accompanied by:
<br>
<br>(i) a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or
<br>
<br>(ii) evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or
<br>
<br>(B) the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies Rule 8002(c)(1)(A)(i).
<br>
<br>(2) Multiple Appeals. If an inmate files under this subdivision the first notice of appeal, the 14-day period provided in subdivision (a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the bankruptcy clerk dockets the first notice.
<br>
<br>(d) Extending the Time to Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) When the Time May be Extended. Except as provided in subdivision (d)(2), the bankruptcy court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party's motion that is filed:
<br>
<br>(A) within the time prescribed by this rule; or
<br>
<br>(B) within 21 days after that time, if the party shows excusable neglect.
<br>
<br>(2) When the Time May Not be Extended. The bankruptcy court may not extend the time to file a notice of appeal if the judgment, order, or decree appealed from:
<br>
<br>(A) grants relief from an automatic stay under §362, 922, 1201, or 1301 of the Code;
<br>
<br>(B) authorizes the sale or lease of property or the use of cash collateral under §363 of the Code;
<br>
<br>(C) authorizes the obtaining of credit under §364 of the Code;
<br>
<br>(D) authorizes the assumption or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under §365 of the Code;
<br>
<br>(E) approves a disclosure statement under §1125 of the Code; or
<br>
<br>(F) confirms a plan under §943, 1129, 1225, or 1325 of the Code.
<br>
<br>(3) Time Limits on an Extension. No extension of time may exceed 21 days after the time prescribed by this rule, or 14 days after the order granting the motion to extend time is entered, whichever is later.

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8002 and F.R.App.P. 4(a) and (c). With the exception of subdivision (c), the changes to the former rule are stylistic. The rule retains the former rule's 14-day time period for filing a notice of appeal, as opposed to the longer periods permitted for appeals in civil cases under F.R.App.P. 4(a).
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) continues to allow any other party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the first notice of appeal is filed, or thereafter to the extent otherwise authorized by this rule. Subdivision (a) also retains provisions of the former rule that prescribe the date the notice of appeal is deemed filed if the appellant files it prematurely or in the wrong court.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b), like former Rule 8002(b) and F.R.App.P. 4(a), tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal when certain postjudgment motions are filed, and it prescribes the effective date of a notice of appeal that is filed before the court disposes of all of the specified motions. As under the former rule, a party that wants to appeal the court's disposition of the motion or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree in response to such a motion must file a notice of appeal or, if it has already filed one, an amended notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Although Rule 8003(a)(3)(C) requires a notice of appeal to be accompanied by the required fee, no additional fee is required for the filing of an amended notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) mirrors the provisions of F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1) and (2), which specify timing rules for a notice of appeal filed by an inmate confined in an institution.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) continues to allow the court to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, except with respect to certain specified judgments, orders, and decrees.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Stylistic changes were made to the title of subdivision (b)(3) and to subdivision (c)(1).
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>Clarifying amendments are made to subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of the rule. They are modeled on parallel provisions of F.R.App.P. 4.
<br>
<br>Paragraph (5) is added to subdivision (a) to clarify the effect of the separate-document requirement of F.R.Civ.P. 58(a) on the entry of a judgment, order, or decree for the purpose of determining the time for filing a notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Rule 7058 adopts F.R.Civ.P. 58 for adversary proceedings. If Rule 58(a) requires a judgment to be set out in a separate document, the time for filing a notice of appeal runs—subject to subdivisions (b) and (c)—from when the judgment is docketed and the judgment is set out in a separate document or, if no separate document is prepared, from 150 days from when the judgment is entered in the docket. The court's failure to comply with the separate-document requirement of Rule 58(a), however, does not affect the validity of an appeal.
<br>
<br>Rule 58 does not apply in contested matters. Instead, under Rule 9021, a separate document is not required, and a judgment or order is effective when it is entered in the docket. The time for filing a notice of appeal under subdivision (a) therefore begins to run upon docket entry in contested matters, as well as in adversary proceedings for which Rule 58 does not require a separate document.
<br>
<br>A clarifying amendment is made to subdivision (b)(1) to conform to a recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)—from which Rule 8002(b)(1) is derived. Former Rule 8002(b)(1) provided that "[i]f a party timely files in the bankruptcy court" certain post-judgment motions, "the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion." Responding to a circuit split concerning the meaning of "timely" in F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), the amendment adopts the majority approach and rejects the approach taken in National Ecological Foundation v. Alexander, 496 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2007). A motion made after the time allowed by the Bankruptcy Rules will not qualify as a motion that, under Rule 8002(b)(1), re-starts the appeal time—and that fact is not altered by, for example, a court order that sets a due date that is later than permitted by the Bankruptcy Rules, another party's consent or failure to object to the motion's lateness, or the court's disposition of the motion without explicit reliance on untimeliness.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c)(1) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1), which was recently amended to streamline and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely deposit and prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a declaration or notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution's mail system and attesting to the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage "is being prepaid,"; not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage "has been prepaid." This change reflects the fact that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the document in the institution's mail system. A new Director's Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.
<br>
<br>The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase "exercises its discretion to permit"—rather than simply "permits"—to help ensure that pro se inmates are aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.
<br>Rule 8003. Appeal as of Right—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
<br>
<br>(a) Filing the Notice of Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. An appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a district court or BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(1) or (a)(2) may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002.
<br>
<br>(2) Effect of Not Taking Other Steps. An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the district court or BAP to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.
<br>
<br>(3) Contents. The notice of appeal must:
<br>
<br>(A) conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form;
<br>
<br>(B) be accompanied by the judgment, order, or decree, or the part of it, being appealed; and
<br>
<br>(C) be accompanied by the prescribed fee.
<br>
<br>(4) Additional Copies. If requested to do so, the appellant must furnish the bankruptcy clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with subdivision (c).
<br>
<br>(b) Joint or Consolidated Appeals.
<br>
<br>(1) Joint Notice of Appeal. When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.
<br>
<br>(2) Consolidating Appeals. When parties have separately filed timely notices of appeal, the district court or BAP may join or consolidate the appeals.
<br>
<br>(c) Serving the Notice of Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) Serving Parties and Transmitting to the United States Trustee. The bankruptcy clerk must serve the notice of appeal on counsel of record for each party to the appeal, excluding the appellant, and transmit it to the United States trustee. If a party is proceeding pro se, the clerk must send the notice of appeal to the party's last known address. The clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.
<br>
<br>(2) Effect of Failing to Serve or Transmit Notice. The bankruptcy clerk's failure to serve notice on a party or transmit notice to the United States trustee does not affect the validity of the appeal.
<br>
<br>(3) Noting Service on the Docket. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties served and the date and method of the service.
<br>
<br>(d) Transmitting the Notice of Appeal to the District Court or BAP; Docketing the Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) Transmitting the Notice. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice to the district clerk.
<br>
<br>(2) Docketing in the District Court or BAP. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8003, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to leave to appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from several former Bankruptcy Rule and Appellate Rule provisions. It addresses appeals as of right, joint and consolidated appeals, service of the notice of appeal, and the timing of the docketing of an appeal in the district court or BAP.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) incorporates, with stylistic changes, much of the content of former Rule 8001(a) regarding the taking of an appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(1) or (2). The rule now requires that the judgment, order, or decree being appealed be attached to the notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b), which is an adaptation of F.R.App.P. 3(b), permits the filing of a joint notice of appeal by multiple appellants that have sufficiently similar interests that their joinder is practicable. It also allows the district court or BAP to consolidate appeals taken separately by two or more parties.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8004 and F.R.App.P. 3(d). Under Rule 8001(c), the former rule's requirement that service of the notice of appeal be accomplished by mailing is generally modified to require that the bankruptcy clerk serve counsel by electronic means. Service on pro se parties must be made by sending the notice to the address most recently provided to the court.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) modifies the provision of former Rule 8007(b), which delayed the docketing of an appeal by the district court or BAP until the record was complete and the bankruptcy clerk transmitted it. The new provision, adapted from F.R.App.P. 3(d) and 12(a), requires the bankruptcy clerk to promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Under this procedure, motions filed in the district court or BAP prior to completion and transmission of the record can generally be placed on the docket of an already pending appeal.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (d)(2), the direction for docketing a bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. Stylistic changes were made to subdivision (c)(1). Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
<br>Rule 8004. Appeal by Leave—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
<br>
<br>(a) Notice of Appeal and Motion for Leave to Appeal. To appeal from an interlocutory order or decree of a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), a party must file with the bankruptcy clerk a notice of appeal as prescribed by Rule 8003(a). The notice must:
<br>
<br>(1) be filed within the time allowed by Rule 8002;
<br>
<br>(2) be accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal prepared in accordance with subdivision (b); and
<br>
<br>(3) unless served electronically using the court's transmission equipment, include proof of service in accordance with Rule 8011(d).
<br>
<br>(b) Contents of the Motion; Response.
<br>
<br>(1) Contents. A motion for leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) must include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
<br>
<br>(B) the question itself;
<br>
<br>(C) the relief sought;
<br>
<br>(D) the reasons why leave to appeal should be granted; and
<br>
<br>(E) a copy of the interlocutory order or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.
<br>
<br>(2) Response. A party may file with the district or BAP clerk a response in opposition or a cross-motion within 14 days after the motion is served.
<br>
<br>(c) Transmitting the Notice of Appeal and the Motion; Docketing the Appeal; Determining the Motion.
<br>
<br>(1) Transmitting to the District Court or BAP. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice and motion to the district clerk.
<br>
<br>(2) Docketing in the District Court or BAP. Upon receiving the notice and motion, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.
<br>
<br>(3) Oral Argument Not Required. The motion and any response or cross-motion are submitted without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.
<br>
<br>(d) Failure to File a Motion With a Notice of Appeal. If an appellant timely files a notice of appeal under this rule but does not include a motion for leave, the district court or BAP may order the appellant to file a motion for leave, or treat the notice of appeal as a motion for leave and either grant or deny it. If the court orders that a motion for leave be filed, the appellant must do so within 14 days after the order is entered, unless the order provides otherwise.
<br>
<br>(e) Direct Appeal to a Court of Appeals. If leave to appeal an interlocutory order or decree is required under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), an authorization of a direct appeal by the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) satisfies the requirement.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8004, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991, related to service of the notice of appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rules 8001(b) and 8003 and F.R.App.P. 5. It retains the practice for interlocutory bankruptcy appeals of requiring a notice of appeal to be filed along with a motion for leave to appeal. Like current Rule 8003, it alters the timing of the docketing of the appeal in the district court or BAP.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) requires a party seeking leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) to file with the bankruptcy clerk both a notice of appeal and a motion for leave to appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) prescribes the contents of the motion, retaining the requirements of former Rule 8003(a). It also continues to allow another party to file a cross-motion or response to the appellant's motion. Because of the prompt docketing of the appeal under the current rule, the cross-motion or response must be filed in the district court or BAP, rather than in the bankruptcy court as the former rule required.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit promptly to the district court or BAP the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to appeal. Upon receipt of the notice and the motion, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, no oral argument will be held on the motion.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) retains the provisions of former Rule 8003(c). It provides that if the appellant timely files a notice of appeal, but fails to file a motion for leave to appeal, the court can either direct that a motion be filed or treat the notice of appeal as the motion and either grant or deny leave.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8003(d), treats the authorization of a direct appeal by the court of appeals as a grant of leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) if the district court or BAP has not already granted leave. Thus, a separate order granting leave to appeal is not required. If the court of appeals grants permission to appeal, the record must be assembled and transmitted in accordance with Rules 8009 and 8010.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (c)(2), the direction for docketing a bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. As published, subdivision (c)(3) stated that the court must dismiss the appeal if the motion for leave to appeal is denied. That sentence was deleted.
<br>Rule 8005. Election to Have an Appeal Heard by the District Court Instead of the BAP
<br>
<br>(a) Filing of a Statement of Election. To elect to have an appeal heard by the district court, a party must:
<br>
<br>(1) file a statement of election that conforms substantially to the appropriate Official Form; and
<br>
<br>(2) do so within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §158(c)(1).
<br>
<br>(b) Transmitting the Documents Related to the Appeal. Upon receiving an appellant's timely statement of election, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the district clerk all documents related to the appeal. Upon receiving a timely statement of election by a party other than the appellant, the BAP clerk must transmit to the district clerk all documents related to the appeal and notify the bankruptcy clerk of the transmission.
<br>
<br>(c) Determining the Validity of an Election. A party seeking a determination of the validity of an election must file a motion in the court where the appeal is then pending. The motion must be filed within 14 days after the statement of election is filed.
<br>
<br>(d) Motion for Leave Without a Notice of Appeal—Effect on the Timing of an Election. If an appellant moves for leave to appeal under Rule 8004 but fails to file a separate notice of appeal with the motion, the motion must be treated as a notice of appeal for purposes of determining the timeliness of a statement of election.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8005, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related to stay pending appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule, which implements 28 U.S.C. §158(c)(1), is derived from former Rule 8001(e). It applies only in districts in which an appeal to a BAP is authorized.
<br>
<br>As the former rule required, subdivision (a) provides that an appellant that elects to have a district court, rather than a BAP, hear its appeal must file with the bankruptcy clerk a statement of election when it files its notice of appeal. The statement must conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form. For appellants, that statement is included in the Notice of Appeal Official Form. If a BAP has been established for appeals from the bankruptcy court and the appellant does not file a timely statement of election, any other party that elects to have the district court hear the appeal must file a statement of election with the BAP clerk no later than 30 days after service of the notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit all appeal documents to the district clerk if the appellant files a timely statement of election. If the appellant does not make that election, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit those documents to the BAP clerk. Upon a timely election by any other party, the BAP clerk must promptly transmit the appeal documents to the district clerk and notify the bankruptcy clerk that the appeal has been transferred.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) provides a new procedure for the resolution of disputes regarding the validity of an election. A motion seeking the determination of the validity of an election must be filed no later than 14 days after the statement of election is filed. Nothing in this rule prevents a court from determining the validity of an election on its own motion.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) provides that, in the case of an appeal by leave, if the appellant files a motion for leave to appeal but fails to file a notice of appeal, the filing and service of the motion will be treated for timing purposes under this rule as the filing and service of the notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (b), a requirement was added that the BAP clerk notify the bankruptcy clerk if an appeal is transferred from the BAP to the district court upon the election of an appellee. Conforming and clarifying changes were made to the Committee Note.
<br>Rule 8006. Certifying a Direct Appeal to the Court of Appeals
<br>
<br>(a) Effective Date of a Certification. A certification of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court for direct review in a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) is effective when:
<br>
<br>(1) the certification has been filed;
<br>
<br>(2) a timely appeal has been taken under Rule 8003 or 8004; and
<br>
<br>(3) the notice of appeal has become effective under Rule 8002.
<br>
<br>(b) Filing the Certification. The certification must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending. For purposes of this rule, a matter remains pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date under Rule 8002 of the first notice of appeal from the judgment, order, or decree for which direct review is sought. A matter is pending in the district court or BAP thereafter.
<br>
<br>(c) Joint Certification by All Appellants and Appellees.
<br>
<br>(1) How Accomplished. A joint certification by all the appellants and appellees under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A) must be made by using the appropriate Official Form. The parties may supplement the certification with a short statement of the basis for the certification, which may include the information listed in subdivision (f)(2).
<br>
<br>(2) Supplemental Statement by the Court. Within 14 days after the parties' certification, the bankruptcy court or the court in which the matter is then pending may file a short supplemental statement about the merits of the certification.
<br>
<br>(d) The Court That May Make the Certification. Only the court where the matter is pending, as provided in subdivision (b), may certify a direct review on request of parties or on its own motion.
<br>
<br>(e) Certification on the Court's Own Motion.
<br>
<br>(1) How Accomplished. A certification on the court's own motion must be set forth in a separate document. The clerk of the certifying court must serve it on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1). The certification must be accompanied by an opinion or memorandum that contains the information required by subdivision (f)(2)(A)–(D).
<br>
<br>(2) Supplemental Statement by a Party. Within 14 days after the court's certification, a party may file with the clerk of the certifying court a short supplemental statement regarding the merits of certification.
<br>
<br>(f) Certification by the Court on Request.
<br>
<br>(1) How Requested. A request by a party for certification that a circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies—or a request by a majority of the appellants and a majority of the appellees—must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree.
<br>
<br>(2) Service and Contents. The request must be served on all parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1), and it must include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
<br>
<br>(B) the question itself;
<br>
<br>(C) the relief sought;
<br>
<br>(D) the reasons why the direct appeal should be allowed, including which circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies; and
<br>
<br>(E) a copy of the judgment, order, or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.
<br>
<br>(3) Time to File a Response or a Cross-Request. A party may file a response to the request within 14 days after the request is served, or such other time as the court where the matter is pending allows. A party may file a cross-request for certification within 14 days after the request is served, or within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree, whichever occurs first.
<br>
<br>(4) Oral Argument Not Required. The request, cross-request, and any response are submitted without oral argument unless the court where the matter is pending orders otherwise.
<br>
<br>(5) Form and Service of the Certification. If the court certifies a direct appeal in response to the request, it must do so in a separate document. The certification must be served on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1).
<br>
<br>(g) Proceeding in the Court of Appeals Following a Certification. Within 30 days after the date the certification becomes effective under subdivision (a), a request for permission to take a direct appeal to the court of appeals must be filed with the circuit clerk in accordance with F.R.App.P. 6(c).

<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8006, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 29, 1994, eff. Aug. 1, 1994; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8001(f), and it provides the procedures for the certification of a direct appeal of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2). Once a case has been certified in the bankruptcy court, the district court, or the BAP for direct appeal and a request for permission to appeal has been timely filed with the circuit clerk, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern further proceedings in the court of appeals.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires that an appeal be properly taken—now under Rule 8003 or 8004—before a certification for direct review in the court of appeals takes effect. This rule requires the timely filing of a notice of appeal under Rule 8002 and accounts for the delayed effectiveness of a notice of appeal under the circumstances specified in that rule. Ordinarily, a notice of appeal is effective when it is filed in the bankruptcy court. Rule 8002, however, delays the effectiveness of a notice of appeal when (1) it is filed after the announcement of a decision or order but prior to the entry of the judgment, order, or decree; or (2) it is filed after the announcement or entry of a judgment, order, or decree but before the bankruptcy court disposes of certain postjudgment motions.
<br>
<br>When the bankruptcy court enters an interlocutory order or decree that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), certification for direct review in the court of appeals may take effect before the district court or BAP grants leave to appeal. The certification is effective when the actions specified in subdivision (a) have occurred. Rule 8004(e) provides that if the court of appeals grants permission to take a direct appeal before leave to appeal an interlocutory ruling has been granted, the authorization by the court of appeals is treated as the granting of leave to appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) provides that a certification must be filed in the court where the matter is pending, as determined by this subdivision. This provision modifies the former rule. Because of the prompt docketing of appeals in the district court or BAP under Rules 8003 and 8004, a matter is deemed—for purposes of this rule only—to remain pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date of the notice of appeal. This provision will in appropriate cases give the bankruptcy judge, who will be familiar with the matter being appealed, an opportunity to decide whether certification for direct review is appropriate. Similarly, subdivision (d) provides that only the court where the matter is then pending according to subdivision (b) may make a certification on its own motion or on the request of one or more parties.
<br>
<br>Section 158(d)(2) provides three different ways in which an appeal may be certified for direct review. Implementing these options, the rule provides in subdivision (c) for the joint certification by all appellants and appellees; in subdivision (e) for the bankruptcy court's, district court's, or BAP's certification on its own motion; and in subdivision (f) for the bankruptcy court's, district court's, or BAP's certification on request of a party or a majority of appellants and a majority of appellees.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (g) requires that, once a certification for direct review is made, a request to the court of appeals for permission to take a direct appeal to that court must be filed with the clerk of the court of appeals no later than 30 days after the effective date of the certification. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 6(c), which incorporates all of F.R.App.P. 5 except subdivision (a)(3), prescribes the procedure for requesting the permission of the court of appeals and governs proceedings that take place thereafter in that court.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivisions (b) and (g), cross-references were added. In subdivision (f)(4), the statement regarding the inapplicability of Rule 9014 was deleted as unnecessary. A clarifying change was made to the first paragraph of the Committee Note.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) is amended to provide authority for the court to file a statement on the merits of a certification for direct review by the court of appeals when the certification is made jointly by all of the parties to the appeal. It is a counterpart to subdivision (e)(2), which allows a party to file a similar statement when the court certifies direct review on the court's own motion.
<br>
<br>The bankruptcy court may file a supplemental statement within 14 days after the certification, even if the appeal is no longer pending before it according to subdivision (b). If the appeal is pending in the district court or BAP during that 14-day period, the appellate court is authorized to file a statement. In all cases, the filing of a statement by the court is discretionary.

<br>The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, referred to in subd. (g), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
<br>Rule 8007. Stay Pending Appeal; Bonds; Suspension of Proceedings
<br>
<br>(a) Initial Motion in the Bankruptcy Court.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. Ordinarily, a party must move first in the bankruptcy court for the following relief:
<br>
<br>(A) a stay of a judgment, order, or decree of the bankruptcy court pending appeal;
<br>
<br>(B) the approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment;
<br>
<br>(C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending; or
<br>
<br>(D) the suspension or continuation of proceedings in a case or other relief permitted by subdivision (e).
<br>
<br>(2) Time to File. The motion may be made either before or after the notice of appeal is filed.
<br>
<br>(b) Motion in the District Court, the BAP, or the Court of Appeals on Direct Appeal.
<br>
<br>(1) Request for Relief. A motion for the relief specified in subdivision (a)(1)—or to vacate or modify a bankruptcy court's order granting such relief—may be made in the court where the appeal is pending.
<br>
<br>(2) Showing or Statement Required. The motion must:
<br>
<br>(A) show that moving first in the bankruptcy court would be impracticable; or
<br>
<br>(B) if a motion was made in the bankruptcy court, either state that the court has not yet ruled on the motion, or state that the court has ruled and set out any reasons given for the ruling.
<br>
<br>(3) Additional Content. The motion must also include:
<br>
<br>(A) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied upon;
<br>
<br>(B) affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and
<br>
<br>(C) relevant parts of the record.
<br>
<br>(4) Serving Notice. The movant must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.
<br>
<br>(c) Filing a Bond or Other Security. The district court, BAP, or court of appeals may condition relief on filing a bond or other security with the bankruptcy court.
<br>
<br>(d) Bond or Other Security for a Trustee or the United States. The court may require a trustee to file a bond or other security when the trustee appeals. A bond or other security is not required when an appeal is taken by the United States, its officer, or its agency or by direction of any department of the federal government.
<br>
<br>(e) Continuation of Proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court. Despite Rule 7062 and subject to the authority of the district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the bankruptcy court may:
<br>
<br>(1) suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case; or
<br>
<br>(2) issue any other appropriate orders during the pendency of an appeal to protect the rights of all parties in interest.

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8005 and F.R.App.P. 8. It now applies to direct appeals in courts of appeals.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires a party ordinarily to seek relief pending an appeal in the bankruptcy court. Subdivision (a)(1) expands the list of relief enumerated in F.R.App.P. 8(a)(1) to reflect bankruptcy practice. It includes the suspension or continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case, as authorized by subdivision (e). Subdivision (a)(2) clarifies that a motion for a stay pending appeal, approval of a supersedeas bond, or any other relief specified in paragraph (1) may be made in the bankruptcy court before or after the filing of a notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) authorizes a party to seek the relief specified in (a)(1), or the vacation or modification of the granting of such relief, by means of a motion filed in the court where the appeal is pending—district court, BAP, or the court of appeals on direct appeal. Accordingly, a notice of appeal need not be filed with respect to a bankruptcy court's order granting or denying such a motion. The motion for relief in the district court, BAP, or court of appeals must state why it was impracticable to seek relief initially in the bankruptcy court, if a motion was not filed there, or why the bankruptcy court denied the relief sought.
<br>
<br>Subdivisions (c) and (d) retain the provisions of the former rule that permit the district court or BAP—and now the court of appeals—to condition the granting of relief on the posting of a bond by the appellant, except when that party is a federal government entity. Rule 9025 governs proceedings against sureties.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e) retains the provision of the former rule that authorizes the bankruptcy court to decide whether to suspend or allow the continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case while the matter for which a stay has been sought is pending on appeal.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The clause "or where it will be taken" was deleted in subdivision (b)(1). Stylistic changes were made to the titles of subdivisions (b) and (e) and in subdivision (e)(1). A discussion of subdivision (e) was added to the Committee Note.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The amendments to subdivisions (a)(1)(B), (c), and (d) conform this rule with the amendment of Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a "supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
<br>Rule 8008. Indicative Rulings
<br>
<br>(a) Relief Pending Appeal. If a party files a timely motion in the bankruptcy court for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the bankruptcy court may:
<br>
<br>(1) defer considering the motion;
<br>
<br>(2) deny the motion; or
<br>
<br>(3) state that the court would grant the motion if the court where the appeal is pending remands for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue.
<br>
<br>(b) Notice to the Court Where the Appeal Is Pending. The movant must promptly notify the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.
<br>
<br>(c) Remand After an Indicative Ruling. If the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the district court or BAP may remand for further proceedings, but it retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the district court or BAP remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the clerk of that court when the bankruptcy court has decided the motion on remand.
<br>

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8008, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 1996, eff. Dec. 1, 1996, related to filing and service, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is an adaptation of F.R.Civ.P. 62.1 and F.R.App.P. 12.1. It provides a procedure for the issuance of an indicative ruling when a bankruptcy court determines that, because of a pending appeal, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant a request for relief that the court concludes is meritorious or raises a substantial issue. The rule does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the bankruptcy court's authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. In contrast, Rule 8002(b) identifies motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before the last such motion is resolved. In those circumstances, the bankruptcy court has authority to resolve the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) requires the movant to notify the court where an appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that it raises a substantial issue. This provision applies to appeals pending in the district court, the BAP, or the court of appeals.
<br>
<br>Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 6 and 12.1 govern the procedure in the court of appeals following notification of the bankruptcy court's indicative ruling.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) of this rule governs the procedure in the district court or BAP upon notification that the bankruptcy court has issued an indicative ruling. The district court or BAP may remand to the bankruptcy court for a ruling on the motion for relief. The district court or BAP may also remand all proceedings, thereby terminating the initial appeal, if it expressly states that it is dismissing the appeal. It should do so, however, only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon the appeal. Otherwise, the district court or BAP may remand for the purpose of ruling on the motion, while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the appeal after the bankruptcy court rules, provided that the appeal is not then moot and a party wishes to proceed.

<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8009. Record on Appeal; Sealed Documents
<br>
<br>(a) Designating the Record on Appeal; Statement of the Issues.
<br>
<br>(1) Appellant.
<br>
<br>(A) The appellant must file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellee a designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.
<br>
<br>(B) The appellant must file and serve the designation and statement within 14 days after:
<br>
<br>(i) the appellant's notice of appeal as of right becomes effective under Rule 8002; or
<br>
<br>(ii) an order granting leave to appeal is entered.
<br>
<br>A designation and statement served prematurely must be treated as served on the first day on which filing is timely.
<br>
<br>(2) Appellee and Cross-Appellant. Within 14 days after being served, the appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record. An appellee who files a cross-appeal must file and serve a designation of additional items to be included in the record and a statement of the issues to be presented on the cross-appeal.
<br>
<br>(3) Cross-Appellee. Within 14 days after service of the cross-appellant's designation and statement, a cross-appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the cross-appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record.
<br>
<br>(4) Record on Appeal. The record on appeal must include the following:
<br>
<br>• docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk;
<br>
<br>• items designated by the parties;
<br>
<br>• the notice of appeal;
<br>
<br>• the judgment, order, or decree being appealed;
<br>
<br>• any order granting leave to appeal;
<br>
<br>• any certification required for a direct appeal to the court of appeals;
<br>
<br>• any opinion, findings of fact, and conclusions of law relating to the issues on appeal, including transcripts of all oral rulings;
<br>
<br>• any transcript ordered under subdivision (b);
<br>
<br>• any statement required by subdivision (c); and
<br>
<br>• any additional items from the record that the court where the appeal is pending orders.
<br>
<br>(5) Copies for the Bankruptcy Clerk. If paper copies are needed, a party filing a designation of items must provide a copy of any of those items that the bankruptcy clerk requests. If the party fails to do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copy at the party's expense.
<br>
<br>(b) Transcript of Proceedings.
<br>
<br>(1) Appellant's Duty to Order. Within the time period prescribed by subdivision (a)(1), the appellant must:
<br>
<br>(A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or
<br>
<br>(B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the appellant is not ordering a transcript.
<br>
<br>(2) Cross-Appellant's Duty to Order. Within 14 days after the appellant files a copy of the transcript order or a certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee as cross-appellant must:
<br>
<br>(A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the cross-appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or
<br>
<br>(B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the cross-appellant is not ordering a transcript.
<br>
<br>(3) Appellee's or Cross-Appellee's Right to Order. Within 14 days after the appellant or cross-appellant files a copy of a transcript order or certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee or cross-appellee may order in writing from the reporter a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the appellee or cross-appellee considers necessary for the appeal. A copy of the order must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk.
<br>
<br>(4) Payment. At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.
<br>
<br>(5) Unsupported Finding or Conclusion. If the appellant intends to argue on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all relevant testimony and copies of all relevant exhibits.
<br>
<br>(c) Statement of the Evidence When a Transcript Is Unavailable. If a transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be filed within the time prescribed by subdivision (a)(1) and served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the bankruptcy court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the bankruptcy clerk in the record on appeal.
<br>
<br>(d) Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal. Instead of the record on appeal as defined in subdivision (a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the bankruptcy court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the bankruptcy court. The statement must set forth only those facts alleged and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the court's resolution of the issues. If the statement is accurate, it—together with any additions that the bankruptcy court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal—must be approved by the bankruptcy court and must then be certified to the court where the appeal is pending as the record on appeal. The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit it to the clerk of that court within the time provided by Rule 8010. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 8018(b) or, in the case of a direct appeal to the court of appeals, by F.R.App.P. 30.
<br>
<br>(e) Correcting or Modifying the Record.
<br>
<br>(1) Submitting to the Bankruptcy Court. If any difference arises about whether the record accurately discloses what occurred in the bankruptcy court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by the bankruptcy court and the record conformed accordingly. If an item has been improperly designated as part of the record on appeal, a party may move to strike that item.
<br>
<br>(2) Correcting in Other Ways. If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected, and a supplemental record may be certified and transmitted:
<br>
<br>(A) on stipulation of the parties;
<br>
<br>(B) by the bankruptcy court before or after the record has been forwarded; or
<br>
<br>(C) by the court where the appeal is pending.
<br>
<br>(3) Remaining Questions. All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the court where the appeal is pending.
<br>
<br>(f) Sealed Documents. A document placed under seal by the bankruptcy court may be designated as part of the record on appeal. In doing so, a party must identify it without revealing confidential or secret information, but the bankruptcy clerk must not transmit it to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending as part of the record. Instead, a party must file a motion with the court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal. If the motion is granted, the movant must notify the bankruptcy court of the ruling, and the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the sealed document to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending.
<br>
<br>(g) Other Necessary Actions. All parties to an appeal must take any other action necessary to enable the bankruptcy clerk to assemble and transmit the record.
<br>

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8009, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to briefs and appendix and filing and service, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8006 and F.R.App.P. 10 and 11(a). The provisions of this rule and Rule 8010 are applicable to appeals taken directly to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2), as well as to appeals to a district court or BAP. See F.R.App.P. 6(c)(2)(A) and (B).
<br>
<br>The rule retains the practice of former Rule 8006 of requiring the parties to designate items to be included in the record on appeal. In this respect, the bankruptcy rule differs from the appellate rule. Among other things, F.R.App.P. 10(a) provides that the record on appeal consists of all the documents and exhibits filed in the case. This requirement would often be unworkable in a bankruptcy context because thousands of items might have been filed in the overall bankruptcy case.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) provides the time period for an appellant to file a designation of items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented. It then provides for the designation of additional items by the appellee, cross-appellant, and cross-appellee, as well as for the cross-appellant's statement of the issues to be presented in its appeal. Subdivision (a)(4) prescribes the content of the record on appeal. Ordinarily, the bankruptcy clerk will not need to have paper copies of the designated items because the clerk will either transmit them to the appellate court electronically or otherwise make them available electronically. If the bankruptcy clerk requires a paper copy of some or all of the items designated as part of the record, the clerk may request the party that designated the item to provide the necessary copies, and the party must comply with the request or bear the cost of the clerk's copying.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) governs the process for ordering a complete or partial transcript of the bankruptcy court proceedings. In situations in which a transcript is unavailable, subdivision (c) allows for the parties' preparation of a statement of the evidence or proceedings, which must be approved by the bankruptcy court.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 10(d) of permitting the parties to agree on a statement of the case in place of the record on appeal. The statement must show how the issues on appeal arose and were decided in the bankruptcy court. It must be approved by the bankruptcy court in order to be certified as the record on appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e), modeled on F.R.App.P. 10(e), provides a procedure for correcting the record on appeal if an item is improperly designated, omitted, or misstated.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f) is a new provision that governs the handling of any document that remains sealed by the bankruptcy court and that a party wants to include in the record on appeal. The party must request the court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal, and that motion must be granted before the bankruptcy clerk may transmit the sealed document to the district, BAP, or circuit clerk.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (g) requires the parties' cooperation with the bankruptcy clerk in assembling and transmitting the record. It retains the requirement of former Rule 8006, which was adapted from F.R.App.P. 11(a).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (a)(2) and (3), the place of filing was clarified. "Docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk" was added to the list in subdivision (a)(4).

<br>The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, referred to in subd. (d), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
<br>Rule 8010. Completing and Transmitting the Record
<br>
<br>(a) Reporter's Duties.
<br>
<br>(1) Proceedings Recorded Without a Reporter Present. If proceedings were recorded without a reporter being present, the person or service selected under bankruptcy court procedures to transcribe the recording is the reporter for purposes of this rule.
<br>
<br>(2) Preparing and Filing the Transcript. The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript in accordance with Rule 8009(b), the reporter must file in the bankruptcy court an acknowledgment of the request that shows when it was received, and when the reporter expects to have the transcript completed.
<br>
<br>(B) After completing the transcript, the reporter must file it with the bankruptcy clerk, who will notify the district, BAP, or circuit clerk of its filing.
<br>
<br>(C) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days after receiving the order, the reporter must request an extension of time from the bankruptcy clerk. The clerk must enter on the docket and notify the parties whether the extension is granted.
<br>
<br>(D) If the reporter does not file the transcript on time, the bankruptcy clerk must notify the bankruptcy judge.
<br>
<br>(b) Clerk's Duties.
<br>
<br>(1) Transmitting the Record—In General. Subject to Rule 8009(f) and subdivision (b)(5) of this rule, when the record is complete, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending either the record or a notice that the record is available electronically.
<br>
<br>(2) Multiple Appeals. If there are multiple appeals from a judgment, order, or decree, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit a single record.
<br>
<br>(3) Receiving the Record. Upon receiving the record or notice that it is available electronically, the district, BAP, or circuit clerk must enter that information on the docket and promptly notify all parties to the appeal.
<br>
<br>(4) If Paper Copies Are Ordered. If the court where the appeal is pending directs that paper copies of the record be provided, the clerk of that court must so notify the appellant. If the appellant fails to provide them, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare them at the appellant's expense.
<br>
<br>(5) When Leave to Appeal is Requested. Subject to subdivision (c), if a motion for leave to appeal has been filed under Rule 8004, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare and transmit the record only after the district court, BAP, or court of appeals grants leave.
<br>
<br>(c) Record for a Preliminary Motion in the District Court, BAP, or Court of Appeals. This subdivision (c) applies if, before the record is transmitted, a party moves in the district court, BAP, or court of appeals for any of the following relief:
<br>
<br>• leave to appeal;
<br>
<br>• dismissal;
<br>
<br>• a stay pending appeal;
<br>
<br>• approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or
<br>
<br>• any other intermediate order.
<br>
<br>The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit to the clerk of the court where the relief is sought any parts of the record designated by a party to the appeal or a notice that those parts are available electronically.

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8010, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, related to form and length of briefs, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8007 and F.R.App.P. 11. It applies to an appeal taken directly to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2), as well as to an appeal to a district court or BAP.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) generally retains the procedure of former Rule 8007(a) regarding the reporter's duty to prepare and file a transcript if a party requests one. It clarifies that the person or service that transcribes the recording of a proceeding is considered the reporter under this rule if the proceeding is recorded without a reporter being present in the courtroom. It also makes clear that the reporter must file with the bankruptcy court the acknowledgment of the request for a transcript and statement of the expected completion date, the completed transcript, and any request for an extension of time beyond 30 days for completion of the transcript.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit the record to the district, BAP or circuit clerk when the record is complete and, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), leave to appeal has been granted. This transmission will be made electronically, either by sending the record itself or sending notice that the record can be accessed electronically. The court where the appeal is pending may, however, require that a paper copy of some or all of the record be furnished, in which case the clerk of that court will direct the appellant to provide the copies. If the appellant does not do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copies at the appellant's expense.
<br>
<br>In a change from former Rule 8007(b), subdivision (b) of this rule no longer directs the clerk of the appellate court to docket the appeal upon receipt of the record from the bankruptcy clerk. Instead, under Rules 8003(d) and 8004(c) and F.R.App.P. 12(a), the district, BAP, or circuit clerk dockets the appeal upon receipt of the notice of appeal or, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to appeal. Accordingly, by the time the district, BAP, or circuit clerk receives the record, the appeal will already be docketed in that court. The clerk of the appellate court must indicate on the docket and give notice to the parties to the appeal when the transmission of the record is received. Under Rule 8018(a) and F.R.App.P. 31, the briefing schedule is generally based on that date.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8007(c) and F.R.App.P. 11(g). It provides for the transmission of parts of the record that the parties designate for consideration by the district court, BAP, or court of appeals in ruling on specified preliminary motions filed prior to the preparation and transmission of the record on appeal.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(1) was revised to more accurately reflect the way in which transcription services are selected. A cross-reference to Rule 8009(b) was added to subdivision (a)(2)(A).
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The amendment of subdivision (c) conforms this rule with the amendment of Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a "supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
<br>Rule 8011. Filing and Service; Signature
<br>
<br>(a) Filing.
<br>
<br>(1) With the Clerk. A document required or permitted to be filed in a district court or BAP must be filed with the clerk of that court.
<br>
<br>(2) Method and Timeliness.
<br>
<br>(A) Nonelectronic Filing.
<br>
<br>(i) In General. For a document not filed electronically, filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii), filing is timely only if the clerk receives the document within the time fixed for filing.
<br>
<br>(ii) Brief or Appendix. A brief or appendix not filed electronically is also timely filed if, on or before the last day for filing, it is:
<br>
<br>• mailed to the clerk by first-class mail—or other class of mail that is at least as expeditious—postage prepaid; or
<br>
<br>• dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days to the clerk.
<br>
<br>(iii) Inmate Filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii). A document not filed electronically by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing and:
<br>
<br>• it is accompanied by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or
<br>
<br>• the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii).
<br>
<br>(B) Electronic Filing.
<br>
<br>(i) By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Exceptions. An entity represented by an attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule.
<br>
<br>(ii) By an Unrepresented Individual—When Allowed or Required. An individual not represented by an attorney:
<br>
<br>• may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and
<br>
<br>• may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that includes reasonable exceptions.
<br>
<br>(iii) Same as a Written Paper. A document filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of these rules.
<br>
<br>(C) Copies. If a document is filed electronically, no paper copy is required. If a document is filed by mail or delivery to the district court or BAP, no additional copies are required. But the district court or BAP may require by local rule or by order in a particular case the filing or furnishing of a specified number of paper copies.
<br>
<br>(3) Clerk's Refusal of Documents. The court's clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any document transmitted for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or by any local rule or practice.
<br>
<br>(b) Service of All Documents Required. Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of the filing of a document, serve it on the other parties to the appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.
<br>
<br>(c) Manner of Service.
<br>
<br>(1) Nonelectronic Service. Nonelectronic service may be by any of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) personal delivery;
<br>
<br>(B) mail; or
<br>
<br>(C) third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days.
<br>
<br>(2) Electronic Service. Electronic service may be made by sending a document to a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or by using other electronic means that the person served consented to in writing.
