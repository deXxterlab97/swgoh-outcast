<br>seed,
<br>5	Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree, sacrificing children in the torrents, under the high rocks?
<br>6	In the parts of the torrent is thy portion, this is thy lot: and thou hast poured out libations to them, thou hast offered sacrifice. Shall I not be angry at these things?
<br>7	Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed, and hast gone up thither to offer victims.
<br>8	And behind the door, and behind the post thou hast set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open hand.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment, and hast multiplied thy per- fumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far off, and wast debased even to hell.
<br>10	Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet thou saidst not: I will rest: thou has found life of thy hand, therefore thou hast not asked.
<br>11	For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou hast forgotten me.
<br>12	I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not profit thee.
<br>13	When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away, but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and shall possess my holy mount.
<br>14	And I will say: Make a way: give free pas- sage, turn out of the path, take away the stum- blingblocks out of the way of my people.
<br>15	For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
<br>16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, and breathings I will make. 17 For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went away wandering in
<br>his own heart.
<br>18	I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back, and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for him.
<br>19	I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace
<br> 
<br>to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed him.
<br>20	But the wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest, and the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire.
<br>21	There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 58
<br>Cry, cease not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their wicked doings, and the house of Jacob their sins.
<br>2	For they seek me from day to day, and de- sire to know my ways, as a nation that hath done justice, and hath not forsaken the judgment of their God: they ask of me the judgments of jus- tice: they are willing to approach to God.
<br>3	Why have we fasted, and thou hast not re- garded: have we humbled our souls, and thou hast not taken notice? Behold in the day of your fast your own will is found, and you exact of all your debtors.
<br>4	Behold you fast for debates and strife, and strike with the fist wickedly. Do not fast as you have done until this day, to make your cry to be heard on high.
<br>5	Is this such a fast as I have chosen: for a man to afflict his soul for a day? is this it, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord?
<br>6	Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen? loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go free, and break asunder every burden.
<br>7	Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the harbourless into thy house: when thou shalt see one naked, cover him, and despise
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not thy own flesh.
<br>8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morn- ing, and thy health shall speedily arise, and thy justice shall go before thy face, and the glory of the Lord shall gather thee up.
<br>9	Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall hear: thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou wilt take away the chain out of the midst of thee, and cease to stretch out the finger, and to speak that which profiteth not.
<br>10	When thou shalt pour out thy soul to the hungry, and shalt satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise up in darkness, and thy dark- ness shall be as the noonday.
<br>11	And the Lord will give thee rest continu- ally, and will fill thy soul with brightness, and deliver thy bones, and thou shalt be like a wa- tered garden, and like a fountain of water whose waters shall not fail.
<br>12	And the places that have been desolate for ages shall be built in thee: thou shalt raise up the foundation of generation and generation: and thou shalt be called the repairer of the fences, turning the paths into rest.
<br>13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sab- bath, from doing thy own will in my holy day, and call the sabbath delightful, and the holy of the Lord glorious, and glorify him, while thou dost not thy own ways, and thy own will is not found, to speak a word:
<br>14	Then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 59
<br>Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear.
<br>2	But your iniquities have divided between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he should not hear.
<br>3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth iniquity.
<br>4	There is none that calleth upon justice, nei- ther is there any one that judgeth truly: but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak vani- ties: they have conceived labour, and brought forth iniquity.
<br>5	They have broken the eggs of asps, and have woven the webs of spiders: he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die: and that which is brought out, shall be hatched into a basilisk.
<br>6	Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are unprofitable works, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.
<br>7	Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are unprof- itable thoughts: wasting and destruction are in their ways.
<br>8	They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their steps: their paths are become crooked to them, every one that treadeth in them knoweth no peace.
<br>9	Therefore is judgment far from us, and jus- tice shall not overtake us. We looked for light, and behold darkness: brightness, and we have walked in the dark.
<br>10	We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness, we are in dark places, as dead men.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as mournful doves. We have looked for judgment, and there is none: for salvation, and it is far from us.
<br>12	For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us: for our wicked doings are with us, and have known our iniquities:
<br>13	In sinning and lying against the Lord: and we have turned away so that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and transgression: we have conceived, and uttered from the heart, words of falsehood.
<br>14	And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far off: because truth hath fallen down in the street, and equity could not come in.
<br>15	And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his eyes, because there is no judgment.
<br>16	And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood astonished, because there is none to op- pose himself: and his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported him.
<br>17	He put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with zeal as with a cloak.
<br>18	As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to the islands.
<br>19	And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord: and they from the rising of the sun, his glory when he shall come as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth on:
<br>20	And there shall come a redeemer to Sion, and to them that return from iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.
<br>21	This is my covenant with them, saith the
<br> 
<br>Lord: My spirit that is in thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seedâ€™s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 60
<br>Arise, be enlightened, O Jerusalem: for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
<br>2 For behold darkness shall cover the earth, and a mist the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. 3 And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and
<br>kings in the brightness of thy rising.
<br>4	Lift up thy eyes round about, and see: all these are gathered together, they are come to thee: thy sons shall come from afar, and thy daughters shall rise up at thy side.
<br>5	Then shalt thou see, and abound, and thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged, when the multitude of the sea shall be converted to thee, the strength of the Gentiles shall come to thee.
<br>6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Madian and Epha: all they from Saba shall come, bringing gold and frankincense: and shewing forth praise to the Lord.
<br>7	All the flocks of Cedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nabaioth shall minister to thee: they shall be offered upon my acceptable altar, and I will glorify the house of my majesty.
<br>8	Who are these, that fly as clouds, and as doves to their windows?
<br>9	For, the islands wait for me, and the ships of the sea in the beginning: that I may bring thy sons from afar: their silver, and their gold with them, to the name of the Lord thy God, and to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
<br>10	And the children of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee: for in my wrath have I struck thee, and in my reconciliation have I had mercy upon thee.
<br>11	And thy gates shall be open continually: they shall not be shut day nor night, that the strength of the Gentiles may be brought to thee, and their kings may be brought.
<br>12	For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee, shall perish: and the Gentiles shall be wasted with desolation.
<br>13	The glory of Libanus shall come to thee, the fir tree, and the box tree, and the pine tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary: and I will glorify the place of my feet.
<br>14	And the children of them that afflict thee, shall come bowing down to thee, and all that slandered thee shall worship the steps of thy feet, and shall call thee the city of the Lord, the Sion of the Holy One of Israel.
<br>15	Because thou wast forsaken, and hated, and there was none that passed through thee, I will make thee to be an everlasting glory, a joy unto generation and generation:
<br>16	And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gen- tiles, and thou shalt be nursed with the breasts of kings: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
<br>17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver: and for wood brass, and for stones iron: and I will make thy visitation peace, and thy overseers justice.
<br>18	Iniquity shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction in thy borders, and sal- vation shall possess thy walls, and praise thy gates.
<br>19	Thou shalt no more have the sun for thy
<br> 
<br>light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light, and thy God for thy glory.
<br>20	Thy sun shall go down no more, and thy moon shall not decrease: for the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
<br>21	And thy people shall be all just, they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my plant- ing, the work of my hand to glorify me.
<br>22	The least shall become a thousand, and a little one a most strong nation: I the Lord will suddenly do this thing in its time.
<br>
<br>Chapter 61
<br>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me: he hath sent me to preach to the meek, to heal the contrite of heart, and to preach a release to the captives, and de- liverance to them that are shut up.
<br>2	To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God: to comfort all that mourn:
<br>3	To appoint to the mourners of Sion, and to give them a crown for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a garment of praise for the spirit of grief: and they shall be called in it the mighty ones of justice, the planting of the Lord to glorify him.
<br>4	And they shall build the places that have been waste from of old, and shall raise up ancient ruins, and shall repair the desolate cities, that were destroyed for generation and generation.
<br>5	And strangers shall stand and shall feed your flocks: and the sons of strangers shall be your husbandman, and the dressers of your vines.
<br>6	But you shall be called the priests of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord: to you it shall be said: Ye ministers of our God: you shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and you shall pride yourselves in their glory.
<br>7	For your double confusion and shame, they shall praise their part: therefore shall they re- ceive double in their land, everlasting joy shall be unto them.
<br>8	For I am the Lord that love judgment, and hate robbery in a holocaust: and I will make their work in truth, and I will make a perpetual covenant with them.
<br>9	And they shall know their seed among the Gentiles, and their offspring in the midst of peo- ples: all that shall see them, shall know them, that these are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.
<br>10	I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall be joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation: and with the robe of justice he hath covered me, as a bridegroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels.
<br>11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth her seed to shoot forth: so shall the Lord God make justice to spring forth, and praise before all the nations.
<br>
<br>Chapter 62
<br>For Sionâ€™s sake I will not hold my peace, and for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not rest till her just one come forth as brightness, and her saviour be lighted as a lamp.
<br>2	And the Gentiles shall see thy just one, and all kings thy glorious one: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.
<br>3	And thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand
<br> 
<br>of thy God.
<br>4	Thou shalt no more be called Forsaken: and thy land shall no more be called Desolate: but thou shalt be called My pleasure in her, and thy land inhabited. Because the Lord hath been well pleased with thee: and thy land shall be inhab- ited.
<br>5	For the young man shall dwell with the vir- gin, and thy children shall dwell in thee.   And the bridegroom shall rejoice over the bride, and thy God shall rejoice over thee.
<br>6	Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have ap- pointed watchmen all the day, and all the night, they shall never hold their peace. You that are mindful of the Lord, hold not your peace,
<br>7	And give him no silence till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
<br>8	The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thy enemies: and the sons of the strangers shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured.
<br>9	For they that gather it, shall eat it, and shall praise the Lord: and they that bring it together, shall drink it in my holy courts.
<br>10	Go through, go through the gates, prepare the way for the people, make the road plain, pick out the stones, and lift up the standard to the people.
<br>11	Behold the Lord hath made it to be heard in the ends of the earth, tell the daughter of Sion: Behold thy Saviour cometh: behold his reward is with him, and his work before him.
<br>12	And they shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord. But thou shalt be called: A city sought after, and not forsaken.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 63
<br>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra, this beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength. I, that speak justice, and am a defender to save.
<br>2	Why then is thy apparel red, and thy gar- ments like theirs that tread in the winepress?
<br>3	I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me: I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.
<br>4	For the day of vengeance is in my heart, the year of my redemption is come.
<br>5	I looked about, and there was none to help: I sought, and there was none to give aid: and my own arm hath saved for me, and my indignation itself hath helped me.
<br>6	And I have trodden down the people in my wrath, and have made them drunk in my indig- nation, and have brought down their strength to the earth.
<br>7	I will remember the tender mercies of the Lord, the praise of the Lord for all the things that the Lord hath bestowed upon us, and for the multitude of his good things to the house of Israel, which he hath given them according to his kindness, and according to the multitude of his mercies.
<br>8	And he said: Surely they are my people, children that will not deny: so he became their saviour.
<br>9	In all their affliction he was not troubled, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love, and in his mercy he redeemed them, and he carried them and lifted them up all the days of old.
<br>10	But they provoked to wrath, and afflicted
<br> 
<br>the spirit of his Holy One: and he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.
<br>11	And he remembered the days of old of Moses, and of his people: Where is he that brought them up out of the sea, with the shep- herds of his flock? where is he that put in the midst of them the spirit of his Holy One?
<br>12	He that brought out Moses by the right hand, by the arm of his majesty: that divided the waters before them, to make himself an ev- erlasting name.
<br>13	He that led them out through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness that stumbleth not.
<br>14	As a beast that goeth down in the field, the spirit of the Lord was their leader: so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name.
<br>15	Look down from heaven, and behold from thy holy habitation and the place of thy glory: where is thy zeal, and thy strength, the multi- tude of thy bowels, and of thy mercies? they have held back themselves from me.
<br>16	For thou art our father, and Abraham hath not known us, and Israel hath been ignorant of us: thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.
<br>17	Why hast thou made us to err, O Lord, from thy ways: why hast thou hardened our heart, that we should not fear thee? return for the sake of thy servants, the tribes of thy inher- itance.
<br>18	They have possessed thy holy people as nothing: our enemies have trodden down thy sanctuary.
<br>19	We are become as in the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and when we were not called by thy name.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 64
<br>O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and wouldst come down: the mountains would melt away at thy presence.
<br>2	They would melt as at the burning of fire, the waters would burn with fire, that thy name might be made known to thy enemies: that the nations might tremble at thy presence.
<br>3	When thou shalt do wonderful things, we shall not bear them: thou didst come down, and at thy presence the mountains melted away.
<br>4	From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears:  the eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee. 5 Thou hast met him that rejoiceth, and doth justice: in thy ways they shall remember thee: behold thou art angry, and we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.
<br>6	And we are all become as one unclean, and all our justices as the rag of a menstruous woman: and we have all fallen as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
<br>7	There is none that calleth upon thy name: that riseth up, and taketh hold of thee: thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast crushed us in the hand of our iniquity.
<br>8	And now, O Lord, thou art our father, and we are clay: and thou art our maker, and we all are the works of thy hands.
<br>9	Be not very angry, O Lord, and remember no longer our iniquity: behold, see we are all thy people.
<br>10	The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is made a desert, Jerusalem is deso- late.
<br>11	The house of our holiness, and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt with fire, and all our lovely things are turned into ruins.
<br> 
<br>12	Wilt thou refrain thyself, O Lord, upon these things, wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us vehemently?
<br>
<br>Chapter 65
<br>They have sought me that before asked not for me, they have found me that sought me not. I said: Behold me, behold me, to a nation that did not call upon my name.
<br>2	I have spread forth my hands all the day to an unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not good after their own thoughts.
<br>3	A people that continually provoke me to anger before my face, that immolate in gardens, and sacrifice upon bricks.
<br>4	That dwell in sepulchres, and sleep in the temple of idols: that eat swineâ€™s flesh, and pro- fane broth is in their vessels.
<br>5	That say: Depart from me, come not near me, because thou art unclean: these shall be smoke in my anger, a fire burning all the day.
<br>6	Behold it is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will render and repay into their bosom.
<br>7	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, who have sacri- ficed upon the mountains, and have reproached me upon the hills; and I will measure back their first work in their bosom.
<br>8	Thus saith the Lord: As if a grain be found in a cluster, and it be said: Destroy it not, be- cause it is a blessing: so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole.
<br>9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Juda a possessor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
<br>10	And the plains shall be turned to folds of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>flocks, and the valley of Achor into a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
<br>11	And you, that have forsaken the Lord, that have forgotten my holy mount, that set a table for fortune, and offer libations upon it,
<br>12	I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke, and you did not hear: and you did evil in my eyes, and you have chosen the things that displease me.
<br>13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold my servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink, and you shall be thirsty.
<br>14	Behold my servants shall rejoice, and you shall be confounded: behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of spirit.
<br>15	And you shall leave your name for an exe- cration to my elect: and the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name.
<br>16	In which he that is blessed upon the earth, shall be blessed in God, amen: and he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by God, amen: because the former distresses are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.
<br>17	For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shall not come upon the heart.
<br>18	But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these things, which I create: for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and the people thereof joy. 19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall no
<br>more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
<br>20 There shall no more be an infant of days there, nor an old man that shall not fill up his
<br> 
<br>days: for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<br>21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of them.
<br>22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of my people, and the works of their hands shall be of long continuance.
<br>23	My elect shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their posterity with them.
<br>24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear; as they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<br>25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; the lion and the ox shall eat straw; and dust shall be the serpentâ€™s food: they shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 66
<br>Thus saith the Lord: Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool: what is this house that you will build to me? and what is this place of my rest?
<br>2	My hand made all these things, and all these things were made, saith the Lord. But to whom shall I have respect, but to him that is poor and little, and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my words?
<br>3	He that sacrificeth an ox, is as if he slew a man: he that killeth a sheep in sacrifice, as if he should brain a dog: he that offereth an oblation, as if he should offer swineâ€™s blood; he that remembereth incense, as if he should bless
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>an idol. All these things have they chosen in their ways, and their soul is delighted in their abominations.
<br>4	Wherefore I also will choose their mockeries, and will bring upon them the things they feared: because I called, and there was none that would answer; I have spoken, and they heard not; and they have done evil in my eyes, and have chosen the things that displease me.
<br>5	Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, and cast you out for my nameâ€™s sake, have said: Let the Lord be glorified, and we shall see in your joy: but they shall be confounded.
<br>6	A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord that ren- dereth recompense to his enemies.
<br>7	Before she was in labour, she brought forth; before her time came to be delivered, she brought forth a man child.
<br>8	Who hath ever heard such a thing? and who hath seen the like to this? shall the earth bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be brought forth at once, because Sion hath been in labour, and hath brought forth her children?
<br>9	Shall not I that make others to bring forth children, myself bring forth, saith the Lord? shall I, that give generation to others, be bar- ren, saith the Lord thy God?
<br>10	Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her.
<br>11	That you may suck, and be filled with the breasts of her consolations: that you may milk out, and flow with delights, from the abundance of her glory.
<br>12	For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as it were a river of peace, and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the Gen- tiles, which you shall suck; you shall be carried
<br> 
<br>at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you.
<br>13	As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<br>14	You shall see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his ser- vants, and he shall be angry with his enemies.
<br>15	For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind, to render his wrath in indignation, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<br>16	For the Lord shall judge by fire, and by his sword unto all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many.
<br>17	They that were sanctified, thought them- selves clean in the gardens behind the gate within, they that did eat swineâ€™s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse: they shall be con- sumed together, saith the Lord.
<br>18	But I know their works, and their thoughts: I come that I may gather them together with all nations and tongues: and they shall come and shall see my glory.
<br>19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send of them that shall be saved, to the Gentiles into the sea, into Africa, and Lydia them that draw the bow: into Italy, and Greece, to the islands afar off, to them that have not heard of me, and have not seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles:
<br>20	And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as if the children of Israel should bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.
<br>21	And I will take of them to be priests, and
<br> 
<br>
<br>Levites, saith the Lord.
<br>22	For as the new heavens, and the new earth, which I will make to stand before me, saith the Lord: so shall your seed stand, and your name.
<br>23	And there shall be month after month, and sabbath after sabbath: and all flesh shall come to adore before my face, saith the Lord.
<br>24	And they shall go out, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched: and they shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh.

<br>
<br>Prophecy of Jeremias
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The words of Jeremias the son of Helcias, of the priests that were in Anathoth, in the land of Ben- jamin.
<br>2	The word of the Lord which came to him in the days of Josias the son of Amon king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
<br>3	And which came to him in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda, even unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.
<br>4	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>5	Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and made thee a prophet unto the nations.
<br>6	And I said: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God:  behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child.
<br>7	And the Lord said to me: Say not: I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.
<br>8	Be not afraid at their presence: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
<br>9	And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me: Behold I have given my words in thy mouth:
<br>10	Lo, I have set thee this day over the na-
<br> 
<br>tions, and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant.
<br>11	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: I see a rod watching.
<br>12	And the Lord said to me: Thou hast seen well: for I will watch over my word to perform it.
<br>13	And the word of the Lord came to me a second time saying: What seest thou? And I said: I see a boiling caldron, and the face thereof from the face of the north.
<br>14	And the Lord said to me: From the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
<br>15	For behold I will call together all the fami- lies of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord: and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda.
<br>16	And I will pronounce my judgments against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.
<br>17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence: for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.
<br>18	For behold I have made thee this day a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.
<br>19	And they shall fight against them, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in the desert, in a land that is not sown.
<br>3	Israel is holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his increase: all they that devour him offend: evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.
<br>4	Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel: 5 Thus saith the Lord: What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are
<br>become vain?
<br>6	And they have not said: Where is the Lord, that made us come up out of the land of Egypt? that led us through the desert, through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of drought, and the image of death, through a land wherein no man walked, nor any man dwelt?
<br>7	And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the fruit thereof, and the best things thereof: and when ye entered in, you defiled my land and made my inheritance an abomination. 8 The priests did not say: Where is the Lord? and they that held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me: and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed idols.
<br> 
<br>9	Therefore will I yet contend in judgment with you, saith the Lord, and I will plead with your children.
<br>10	Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see: and send into Cedar, and consider diligently: and see if there hath been done any thing like this.
<br>11	If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory into an idol.
<br>12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord. 13 For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken
<br>cisterns, that can hold no water.
<br>14	Is Israel a bondman, or a homeborn slave? why then is he become a prey?
<br>15	The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise, they have made his land a wilder- ness: his cities are burnt down, and there is none to dwell in them.
<br>16	The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have defloured thee, even to the crown of the head.
<br>17	Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the way?
<br>18	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?
<br>19	Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord the God of hosts. 20 Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. For on every high hill, and under every
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>green tree thou didst prostitute thyself.
<br>21	Yet, I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed: how then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O strange vineyard?
<br>22	Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before me, saith the Lord God.
<br>23	How canst thou say: I am not polluted, I have not walked after Baalim? see thy ways in the valley, know what thou hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.
<br>24	A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love: none shall turn her away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they shall find her.
<br>25	Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst.   But thou saidst:   I have lost all hope, I will not do it: for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.
<br>26	As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes and their priests, and their prophets.
<br>27	Saying to a stock: Thou art my father: and to a stone: Thou hast begotten me: they have turned their back to me, and not their face: and in the time of their affliction they will say: Arise, and deliver us.
<br>28	Where are the gods, whom thou hast made thee? let them arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction: for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.
<br>29	Why will you contend with me in judg- ment? you have all forsaken me, saith the Lord. 30 In vain have I struck your children, they have not received correction: your sword hath devoured your prophets, your generation is like
<br> 
<br>a ravaging lion.
<br>31	See ye the word of the Lord: Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a lateward springing land? why then have my people said: We are revolted, we will come to thee no more?
<br>32	Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her stomacher? but my people hath for- gotten me days without number.
<br>33	Why dost thou endeavour to shew thy way good to seek my love, thou who hast also taught thy malices to be thy ways,
<br>34	And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and innocent? not in ditches have I found them, but in all places, which I mentioned before.
<br>35	And thou hast said: I am without sin and am innocent: and therefore let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will contend with thee in judgment, because thou hast said: I have not sinned.
<br>36	How exceeding base art thou become, go- ing the same ways over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
<br>37	For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon thy head: for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt have nothing prosperous therein.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>It is commonly said: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and marry another man, shall he return to her any more? shall not that woman be polluted, and defiled? but thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers: nevertheless return to me, saith the Lord, and I will receive thee.
<br>2 Lift up thy eyes on high: and see where
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou hast not prostituted thyself: thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them as a robber in the wilderness: and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications, and with thy wickedness.
<br>3	Therefore the showers were withholden, and there was no lateward rain: thou hadst a harlotâ€™s forehead, thou wouldst not blush.
<br>4	Therefore at the least from this time call to me: Thou art my father, the guide of my virgin- ity:
<br>5	Wilt thou be angry for ever, or wilt thou continue unto the end? Behold, thou hast spo- ken, and hast done evil things, and hast been able.
<br>6	And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias: Hast thou seen what rebellious Is- rael hath done? she hath gone of herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.
<br>7	And when she had done all these things, I said: Return to me, and she did not return. And her treacherous sister Juda saw,
<br>8	That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce: yet her treacherous sister Juda was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.
<br>9	And by the facility of her fornication she de- filed the land, and played the harlot with stones and with stocks.
<br>10	And after all this, her treacherous sister Juda hath not returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.
<br>11	And the Lord said to me: The rebellious Israel hath justified her soul, in comparison of the treacherous Juda.
<br>12	Go, and proclaim these words towards the north, and thou shalt say: Return, O rebellious Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not turn away my face from you: for I am holy, saith the Lord,
<br> 
<br>and I will not be angry for ever.
<br>13	But yet acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God: and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my voice, saith the Lord.
<br>14	Return, O ye revolting children, saith the Lord: for I am your I husband: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a kindred, and will bring you into Sion.
<br>15	And I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowl- edge and doctrine.
<br>16	And when you shall be multiplied, and in- crease in the land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come upon the heart, neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited, neither shall that be done any more.
<br>17	At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the name of the Lord to Jerusalem, and they shall not walk after the perversity of their most wicked heart.
<br>18	In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land which I gave to your fathers.
<br>19	But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the Gentiles? And I said: Thou shalt call me father and shalt not cease to walk after me.
<br>20	But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord.
<br>21	A voice was heard in the highways, weep- ing and howling of the children of Israel: because they have made their way wicked, they have for- gotten the Lord their God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your rebellions. Behold we come to thee: for thou art the Lord our God.
<br>23	In very deed the hills were liars, and the multitude of the mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
<br>24	Confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
<br>25	We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall cover us, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth even to this day, and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, re- turn to me: if thou wilt take away thy stum- blingblocks out of my sight, thou shalt not be moved.
<br>2	And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth, and in judgment, and in justice: and the Gentiles shall bless him, and shall praise him.
<br>3	For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem: Break up anew your fal- low ground, and sow not upon thorns:
<br>4	Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be none that can quench it because of the wickedness of your thoughts.
<br>5	Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem: speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say: Assemble your- selves, and let us go into strong cities.
<br>6	Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay not: for I bring evil from the
<br> 
<br>north, and great destruction.
<br>7	The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining without an inhabitant.
<br>8	For this gird yourselves with haircloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.
<br>9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord: That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes: and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed.
<br>10	And I  said:  Alas,  alas,  alas,  O  Lord God, hast thou then deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: You shall have peace: and behold the sword reacheth even to the soul?
<br>11	At that time it shall be said to this people, and to Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.
<br>12	A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I will speak my judgments with them.
<br>13	Behold he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we are laid waste.
<br>14	Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee?
<br>15	For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice of the idol from mount Ephraim.
<br>16	Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in Jerusalem, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Juda.
<br>17	They are set round about her, as keepers of fields: because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.
<br>18	Thy ways, and thy devices have brought
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>these things upon thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.
<br>19	My bowels, my bowels are in part, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.
<br>20	Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are de- stroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a mo- ment.
<br>21	How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?
<br>22	For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
<br>23	I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the heavens, and there was no light in them.
<br>24	I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.
<br>25	I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of the air were gone.
<br>26	I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilder- ness: and all its cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the wrath of his indignation.
<br>27	For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.
<br>28	The Earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.
<br>29	At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away: they have en- tered into thickets and climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.
<br>30	But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou
<br> 
<br>do?   though thou clothest thyself with scar- let, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.
<br>31	For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail, anguishes as of a woman in labour of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Go about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man that executeth judgment, and seeketh faith: and I will be mer- ciful unto it.
<br>2	And though they say: The Lord liveth; this also they will swear falsely.
<br>3	O Lord, thy eyes are upon truth: thou hast struck them, and they have not grieved: thou hast bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, and they have refused to return.
<br>4	But I said: Perhaps these are poor and fool- ish, that know not the way of the Lord, the judg- ment of their God.
<br>5	I will go therefore to the great men, and will speak to them: for they have known the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God: and behold these have altogether broken the yoke more, and have burst the bonds.
<br>6	Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their cities: every one that shall go out thence shall be taken, because their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>strengthened.
<br>7	How can I be merciful to thee? thy chil- dren have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not gods: I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and rioted in the harlotâ€™s house.
<br>8	They are become as amorous horses and stal- lions: every one neighed after his neighbourâ€™s wife.
<br>9	Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? and shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?
<br>10	Scale the walls thereof, and throw them down, but do not utterly destroy: take away the branches thereof, because they are not the Lordâ€™s.
<br>11	For the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have greatly transgressed against me, saith the Lord.
<br>12	They have denied the Lord, and said, It is not he: and the evil shall not come upon us: we shall not see the sword and famine.
<br>13	The prophets have spoken in the wind, and there was no word of God in them: these things therefore shall befall them.
<br>14	Thus saith the Lord the God of hosts: be- cause you have spoken this word, behold I will make my words in thy mouth as fire, and this people as wood, and it shall devour them.
<br>15	Behold I will bring upon you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, saith the Lord: a strong nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose lan- guage thou shalt not know, nor understand what they say.
<br>16	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all valiant.
<br>17	And they shall eat up thy corn, and thy bread: they shall devour thy sons, and thy daughters: they shall eat up thy flocks, and thy herds: they shall eat thy vineyards, and thy figs:
<br> 
<br>and with the sword they shall destroy thy strong cities, wherein thou trustest.
<br>18	Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not bring you to utter destruction.
<br>19	And if you shall say: Why hath the Lord our God done all these things to us? thou shalt say to them: As you have forsaken me, and served a strange god in your own land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not your own.
<br>20	Declare ye this to the house of Jacob, and publish it in Juda, saying:
<br>21	Hear, O foolish people, and without under- standing: who have eyes, and see not: and ears, and hear not.
<br>22	Will not you then fear me, saith the Lord: and will you not repent at my presence? I have set the sand a bound for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over: and the waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail: they shall swell, and shall not pass over it.
<br>23	But the heart of this people is become hard of belief and provoking, they are revolted and gone away.
<br>24	And they have not said in their heart: Let us fear the Lord our God, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season: who preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest.
<br>25	Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
<br>26	For among my people are found wicked men, that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch men.
<br>27	As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit: therefore are they become great and enriched.
<br>28	They are grown gross and fat: and have most wickedly transgressed my words. They
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>have not judged the cause of the widow, they have not managed the cause of the fatherless, and they have not judged the judgment of the poor.
<br>29	Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?
<br>30	Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land.
<br>31	The prophets prophesied falsehood, and the priests clapped their hands: and my peo- ple loved such things: what then shall be done in the end thereof?
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Strengthen yourselves, ye sons of Benjamin, in the midst of Jerusalem, and sound the trum- pet in Thecua, and set up the standard over Bethacarem:   for evil is seen out of the north, and a great destruction.
<br>2	I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beau- tiful and delicate woman.
<br>3	The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks: they have pitched their tents against her round about: every one shall feed them that are under his hand.
<br>4	Prepare ye war against her: arise, and let us go up at midday: woe unto us, for the day is declined, for the shadows of the evening are grown longer.
<br>5	Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her houses.
<br>6	For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hew down her trees, cast up a trench about Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited, all oppression is in the midst of her.
<br>7	As a cistern maketh its water cold, so hath she made her wickedness cold: violence and spoil
<br> 
<br>shall be heard in her, infirmity and stripes are continually before me.
<br>8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land uninhabited.
<br>9	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall gather the remains of Israel, as in a vine, even to one cluster: turn back thy hand, as a grape- gatherer into the basket.
<br>10	To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I testify, that he may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: be- hold the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach: and they will not receive it.
<br>11	Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the child  abroad, and  upon  the  council  of  the young men together: for man and woman shall be taken, the ancient and he that is full of days. 12 And their houses shall be turned over to others, with their lands and their wives together: for I will stretch forth my hand upon the inhab-
<br>itants of the land, saith the Lord.
<br>13	For from the least of them even to the greatest, all are given to covetousness: and from the prophet even to the priest, all are guilty of deceit.
<br>14	And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: and there was no peace.
<br>15	They were confounded, because they com- mitted abomination: yea, rather they were not confounded with confusion, and they knew not how to blush: wherefore they shall fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall fall down, saith the Lord.
<br>16	Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye on the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk ye in it: and you shall find refreshment for your souls. And they said: We
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>will not walk.
<br>17	And I appointed watchmen over you, say- ing: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.
<br>18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.
<br>19	Hear, O earth: Behold   I   will   bring evils upon this people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.
<br>20	To what purpose do you bring me frank- incense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are not ac- ceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me. 21 Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbour
<br>and kinsman shall perish.
<br>22	Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.
<br>23	They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against thee, O daughter of Sion.
<br>24	We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labour.
<br>25	Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.
<br>26	Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamenta- tion, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
<br>27	I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt know, and prove their
<br> 
<br>way.
<br>28	All these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.
<br>29	The bellows have failed, the lead is con- sumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.
<br>30	Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord, and proclaim there this word, and say: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye men of Juda, that enter in at these gates, to adore the Lord.
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Make your ways and your doings good: and I will dwell with you in this place.
<br>4	Trust not in lying words, saying: The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, it is the temple of the Lord.
<br>5	For if you will order well your ways, and your doings: if you will execute judgment between a man and his neighbour,
<br>6	If you oppress not the stranger, the father- less, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and walk not after strange gods to your own hurt,
<br>7	I will dwell with you in this place: in the land, which I gave to your fathers from the be- ginning and for evermore.
<br>8	Behold you put your trust in lying words, which shall not profit you:
<br>9	To steal, to murder, to commit adultery, to swear falsely, to offer to Baalim, and to go after strange gods, which you know not.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And you have come, and stood before me in this house, in which my name is called upon, and have said: We are delivered, because we have done all these abominations.
<br>11	Is this house then, in which my name hath been called upon, in your eyes become a den of robbers? I, I am he: I have seen it, saith the Lord.
<br>12	Go ye to my place in Silo, where my name dwelt from the beginning: and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel:
<br>13	And now, because you have done all these works, saith the Lord: and I have spoken to you rising up early, and speaking, and you have not heard: and I have called you, and you have not answered:
<br>14	I will do to this house, in which my name is called upon, and in which you trust, and to the place which I have given you and your fathers, as I did to Silo.
<br>15	And I will cast you away from before my face, as I have cast away all your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.
<br>16	Therefore do not thou pray for this people, nor take to thee praise and supplication for them: and do not withstand me: for I will not hear thee. 17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities
<br>of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<br>18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to offer libations to strange gods, and to provoke me to anger.
<br>19	Do they provoke me to anger, saith the Lord? is it not themselves, to the confusion of their own countenance?
<br>20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- hold my wrath and my indignation is enkindled against this place, upon men and upon beasts, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the
<br> 
<br>fruits of the land, and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
<br>21	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Is- rael: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat ye the flesh.
<br>22	For I spoke not to your fathers, and I com- manded them not, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning the matter of burnt offerings and sacrifices.
<br>23	But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.
<br>24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear: but walked in their own will, and in the per- versity of their wicked heart: and went backward and not forward,
<br>25	From the day that their fathers came out of the land of Egypt, even to this day. And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, from day to day, rising up early and sending.
<br>26	And they have not hearkened to me: nor inclined their ear: but have hardened their neck, and have done worse than their fathers.
<br>27	And thou shalt speak to them all these words, but they will not hearken to thee: and thou shalt call them, but they will not answer thee.
<br>28	And thou shalt say to them: This is a na- tion which hath not hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, nor received instruction: faith is lost, and is taken away out of their mouth.
<br>29	Cut off thy hair, and cast it away: and take up a lamentation on high: for the Lord hath re- jected, and forsaken the generation of his wrath, 30 Because the children of Juda have done evil in my eyes, saith the Lord. They have set their abominations in the house in which my name is
<br>called upon, to pollute it;
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>31	And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of En- nom, to burn their sons, and their daughters in the fire: which I commanded not, nor thought on in my heart.
<br>32	Therefore behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and it shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom: but the val- ley of slaughter: and they shall bury in Topheth, because there is no place.
<br>33	And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall be none to drive them away.
<br>34	And I will cause to cease out of the cities of Juda, and out of the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>At that time, saith the Lord, they shall cast out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of the princes thereof, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves. 2 And they shall spread them abroad to the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom have walked, and whom they have sought, and adored: they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried: they
<br>shall be as dung upon the face of the earth.
<br>3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all that shall remain of this wicked kindred in all places, which are left, to which I have cast them out, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>4	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the
<br> 
<br>Lord: Shall not he that falleth, rise again? and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again? 5 Why then is this people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? they have laid
<br>hold on lying, and have refused to return.
<br>6	I attended, and hearkened; no man speaketh what is good, there is none that doth penance for his sin, saying: What have I done? They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing to the battle.
<br>7	The kite in the air hath known her time: the turtle, and the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord.
<br>8	How do you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Indeed the lying pens of the scribes hath wrought falsehood.
<br>9	The wise men are confounded, they are dis- mayed, and taken: for they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them.
<br>10	Therefore will I give their women to strangers, their fields to others for an inheri- tance: because from the least even to the great- est all follow covetousness: from the prophet even to the priest all deal deceitfully.
<br>11	And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: when there was no peace.
<br>12	They are confounded, because they have committed abomination: yea rather they are not confounded with confusion, and they have not known how to blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visi- tation they shall fall, saith the Lord.
<br>13	Gathering I will gather them together, saith the Lord, there is no grape on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig tree, the leaf is fallen: and I have given them the things that are passed away.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced city, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and hath given us water of gall to drink: for we have sinned against the Lord.
<br>15	We looked for peace and no good came: for a time of healing, and behold fear.
<br>16	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan, all the land was moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors: and they came and devoured the land, and all that was in it: the city and its inhabitants.
<br>17	For behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.
<br>18	My sorrow is above sorrow, my heart mour- neth within me.
<br>19	Behold the voice of the daughter of my peo- ple from a far country: Is not the Lord in Sion, or is not her king in her? why then have they pro- voked me to wrath with their idols, and strange vanities?
<br>20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
<br>21	For the affliction of the daughter of my people I am afflicted, and made sorrowful, as- tonishment hath taken hold on me.
<br>22	Is there no balm in Galaad? or is there no physician there? Why then is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Who will give water to my head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes? and I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people. 2 Who will give me in the wilderness a lodg- ing place of wayfaring men, and I will leave my people, and depart from them? because they are
<br> 
<br>all adulterers, an assembly of transgressors.
<br>3	And they have bent their tongue, as a bow, for lies, and not for truth: they have strength- ened themselves upon the earth, for they have proceeded from evil to evil, and me they have not known, saith the Lord.
<br>4	Let every man take heed of his neighbour, and let him not trust in any brother of his: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully.
<br>5	And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth: for they have taught their tongue to speak lies: they have laboured to commit iniquity.
<br>6	Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit: through deceit they have refused to know me, saith the Lord.
<br>7	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Be- hold I will melt, and try them: for what else shall I do before the daughter of my people?
<br>8	Their tongue is a piercing arrow, it hath spo- ken deceit: with his mouth one speaketh peace with his friend, and secretly he lieth in wait for him.
<br>9	Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul be revenged on such a nation?
<br>10	For the mountains I will take up weeping and lamentation, and for the beautiful places of the desert, mourning: because they are burnt up, for that there is not a man that passeth through them: and they have not heard the voice of the owner: from the fowl of the air to the beasts they are gone away and departed.
<br>11	And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps of sand, and dens of dragons: and I will make the cities of Juda desolate, for want of an inhabitant. 12 Who is the wise man, that may understand this, and to whom the word of the mouth of the Lord may come that he may declare this, why
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the land hath perished, and is burnt up like a wilderness, which none passeth through?
<br>13	And the Lord said: Because they have for- saken my law, which I gave them, and have not heard my voice, and have not walked in it.
<br>14	But they have gone after the perverseness of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them.
<br>15	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. 16 And I will scatter them among the nations, which they and their fathers have not known: and I will send the sword after them till they be
<br>consumed.
<br>17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, and let them come: and send to them that are wise women, and let them make haste: 18 Let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us: let our eyes shed tears, and our eyelids
<br>run down with waters.
<br>19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion: How are we wasted and greatly con- founded? because we have left the land, because our dwellings are cast down.
<br>20	Hear therefore, ye women, the word of the Lord: and let your ears receive the word of his mouth: and teach your daughters wailing: and every one her neighbour mourning.
<br>21	For death is come up through our win- dows, it is entered into our houses to destroy the children from without, the young men from the streets.
<br>22	Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Even the car- cass of man shall fall as dung upon the face of the country, and as grass behind the back of the mower, and there is none to gather it.
<br>23	Thus saith the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man
<br> 
<br>glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches:
<br>24	But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and jus- tice in the earth: for these things please me, saith the Lord.
<br>25	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit upon every one that hath the foreskin circumcised.
<br>26	Upon Egypt, and upon Juda, and upon Edom, and upon the children of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon all that have their hair polled round, that dwell in the desert: for all the nations are uncircumcised in the flesh, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Hear ye the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O house of Israel.
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord: Learn not according to the ways of the Gentiles: and be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear:
<br>3	For the laws of the people are vain: for the works of the hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe.
<br>4	He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall asunder.
<br>5	They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they cannot go. Therefore fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.
<br>6	There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great, and great is thy name in might.
<br>7	Who shall not fear thee, O king of nations?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.
<br>8	They shall be all proved together to be sense- less and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.
<br>9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: vi- olet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.
<br>10	But the Lord is the true God: he is the liv- ing God, and the everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.
<br>11	Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.
<br>12	He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.
<br>13	At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 14 Every man is become a fool for knowledge, every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit
<br>in them.
<br>15	They are vain things, and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<br>16	The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.
<br>17	Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.
<br>18	For thus saith he Lord: Behold I will cast
<br> 
<br>away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.
<br>19	Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.
<br>20	My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
<br>21	Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scat- tered.
<br>22	Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.
<br>23	I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.
<br>24	Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judg- ment: and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.
<br>25	Pour out thy indignation upon the na- tions that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, saying:
<br>2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br>3	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord the God of Israel: Cursed is the man that shall not hearken to the words of this covenant, 4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you
<br>shall be my people, and I will be your God:
<br>5	That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flow- ing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said:  Amen, O Lord.
<br>6	And the Lord said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:
<br>7	For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt even to this day: rising early I conjured them, and said: Hearken ye to my voice:
<br>8	And they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear: but walked every one in the perverseness of his own wicked heart: and I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
<br>9	And the Lord said to me: A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>10	They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers, who refused to hear my words: so these likewise have gone after strange gods, to serve them: the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have made void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.
<br>11	Wherefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring in evils upon them, which they shall not be able to escape: and they shall cry to me, and I will not hearken to them.
<br>12	And the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice, and they shall not save
<br> 
<br>them in the time of their affliction.
<br>13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda: and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem thou hast set up altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim.
<br>14	Therefore do not thou pray for this people, and do not take up praise and prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time of their cry to me, in the time of their affliction.
<br>15	What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?
<br>16	The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it, and the branches thereof are burnt.
<br>17	And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and of the house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering sacrifice to Baalim.
<br>18	But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their do- ings.
<br>19	And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.
<br>20	But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and the hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause.
<br>21	Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, and thou shalt not die in our hands.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Be- hold I will visit upon them: their young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.
<br>23	And there shall be no remains of them: for I will bring in evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but yet I will speak what is just to thee: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?
<br>2	Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
<br>3	And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as for the day of slaughter. 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not
<br>see our last end.
<br>5 If thou hast been wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan? 6 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them
<br>not when they speak good things to thee.
<br>7	I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the hand of her enemies.
<br>8	My inheritance is become to me as a lion in
<br> 
<br>the wood: it hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.
<br>9	Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? is it as a bird dyed throughout? come ye, assem- ble yourselves, all ye beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.
<br>10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a deso- late wilderness.
<br>11	They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that con- sidereth in the heart.
<br>12	The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.
<br>13	They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.
<br>14	Thus saith the Lord against all wicked neighbours, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.
<br>15	And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and will bring them back, every man to his inheritance, and every man into his land.
<br>16	And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by Baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
<br>17	But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 13
<br>Thus saith the Lord to me:   Go, and get thee a linen girdle, and thou shalt put it about thy loins, and shalt not put it into water.
<br>2	And I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.
<br>3	And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying:
<br>4	Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is about thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
<br>5	And I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.
<br>6	And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me: Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle, which I com- manded thee to hide there.
<br>7	And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle out of the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was rotten, so that it was fit for no use.
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>9	Thus saith the Lord:  After this manner will I make the pride of Juda, and the great pride of Jerusalem to rot.
<br>10	This wicked people, that will not hear my words, and that walk in the perverseness of their heart, and have gone after strange gods to serve them, and to adore them: and they shall be as this girdle ,which is fit for no use.
<br>11	For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man, so have I brought close to me all the house of Israel, and all the house of Juda, saith the Lord: that they might be my people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
<br>12	Thou shalt speak therefore to them this word: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel:
<br> 
<br>Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to thee: Do we not know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
<br>13	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings of the race of David that sit upon his throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
<br>14	And I will scatter them every man from his brother, and fathers and sons in like manner, saith the Lord: I will not spare, and I will not pardon: nor will I have mercy, but to destroy them.
<br>15	Hear ye, and give ear: Be not proud, for the Lord hath spoken.
<br>16	Give ye glory to the Lord your God, before it be dark, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains: you shall look for light, and he will turn it into the shadow of death, and into darkness.
<br>17	But if you will not hear this, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride: weeping it shall weep, and my eyes shall run down with tears, because the flock of the Lord is carried away cap- tive.
<br>18	Say to the king, and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit down: for the crown of your glory is come down from your head.
<br>19	The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to open them: all Juda is carried away captive with an entire captivity.
<br>20	Lift up your eyes, and see, you that come from the north: where is the flock that is given thee, thy beautiful cattle?
<br>21	What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee?   for thou hast taught them against thee, and instructed them against thy own head: shall not sorrows lay hold on thee, as a woman in labour?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	And if thou shalt say in thy heart: Why are these things come upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity, thy nakedness is discovered, the soles of thy feet are defiled.
<br>23	If the Ethiopian can change his skin, or the leopard his spots: you also may do well, when you have learned evil.
<br>24	And I will scatter them as stubble, which is carried away by the wind in the desert.
<br>25	This is thy lot, and the portion of thy mea- sure from me, saith the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me, and hast trusted in falsehood.
<br>26	Wherefore I have also bared thy thighs against thy face, and thy shame hath appeared. 27 I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neigh- ing, the wickedness of thy fornication: and thy abominations, upon the hills in the field. Woe to thee, Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean
<br>after me: how long yet?
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias con- cerning the words of the drought.
<br>2	Judea hath mourned, and the gates thereof are fallen, and are become obscure on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
<br>3	The great ones sent their inferiors to the water: they came to draw, they found no wa- ter, they carried back their vessels empty: they were confounded and afflicted, and covered their heads.
<br>4	For the destruction of the land, because there came no rain upon the earth, the husband- man were confounded, they covered their heads. 5 Yea, the hind also brought forth in the field,
<br>and left it, because there was no grass.
<br>6 And the wild asses stood upon the rocks, they snuffed up the wind like dragons, their eyes
<br> 
<br>failed, because there was no grass.
<br>7 If our iniquities have testified against us, O Lord, do thou it for thy nameâ€™s sake, for our rebellions are many, we have sinned against thee. 8 O expectation of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble: why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man turning in
<br>to lodge?
<br>9	Why wilt thou be as a wandering man, as a mighty man that cannot save? but thou, O Lord, art among us, and thy name is called upon by us, forsake us not.
<br>10	Thus saith the Lord to this people, that have loved to move their feet, and have not rested, and have not pleased the Lord: He will now remember their iniquities, and visit their sins.
<br>11	And the Lord said to me: Pray not for this people for their good.
<br>12	When they fast I will not hear their prayers: and if they offer holocausts and vic- tims, I will not receive them: for I will consume them by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence.
<br>13	And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, the prophets say to them: You shall not see the sword, and there shall be no famine among you, but he will give you true peace in this place.
<br>14	And the Lord said to me: The prophets prophesy falsely in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor have I spo- ken to them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination and deceit, and the se- duction of their own heart.
<br>15	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, whom I did not send, that say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
<br>16	And the people to whom they prophesy,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem be- cause of the famine and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them: they and their wives, their sons and their daughters, and I will pour out their own wickedness upon them.
<br>17	And thou shalt speak this word to them: Let my eyes shed down tears night and day, and let them not cease, because the virgin daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction, with an exceeding grievous evil.
<br>18	If I go forth into the fields, behold the slain with the sword: and if I enter into the city, be- hold them that are consumed with famine. The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land which they knew not.
<br>19	Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, or hath thy soul abhorred Sion? why then hast thou struck us, so that there is no healing for us? we have looked for peace, and there is no good: and for the time of healing, and behold trouble.
<br>20	We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquities of our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
<br>21	Give us not to be a reproach, for thy nameâ€™s sake, and do not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
<br>22	Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles that can send rain? or can the heav- ens give showers? art not thou the Lord our God, whom we have looked for? for thou hast made all these things.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And the Lord said to me: If Moses and Samuel shall stand before me, my soul is not towards this people: cast them out from my sight, and let them go forth.
<br> 
<br>2	And if they shall say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Such as are for death, to death: and such as are for the sword, to the sword: and such as are for famine, to famine: and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
<br>3	And I will visit them with four kinds, saith the Lord: The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
<br>4	And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the earth: because of Manasses the son of Ezechias the king of Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.
<br>5	For who shall have pity on thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go to pray for thy peace?
<br>6	Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward:  and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee: I am weary of entreating thee.
<br>7	And I will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the land: I have killed and destroyed my people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.
<br>8	Their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a spoiler at noonday: I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities.
<br>9	She that hath borne seven is become weak, her soul hath fainted away: her sun is gone down, while it was yet day: she is confounded, and ashamed: and the residue of them I will give up to the sword in the sight of their enemies, saith the Lord.
<br>10	Woe is me, my mother: why hast thou borne me a man of strife, a man of contention to all the earth? I have not lent on usury, neither hath any man lent to me on usury: yet all curse
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>me.
<br>11	The Lord saith to me: Assuredly it shall be well with thy remnant, assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction, and in the time of tribulation against the enemy.
<br>12	Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north, and the brass?
<br>13	Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for nothing, because of all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
<br>14	And I will bring thy enemies out of a land, which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in my rage, it shall burn upon you.
<br>15	O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and defend me from them that perse- cute me, do not defend me in thy patience: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
<br>16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was to me a joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name is called upon me, O Lord God of hosts.
<br>17	I sat not in the assembly of jesters, nor did I make a boast of the presence of thy hand: I sat alone, because thou hast filled me with threats. 18 Why is my sorrow become perpetual, and my wound desperate so as to refuse to be healed? it is become to me as the falsehood of deceitful
<br>waters that cannot be trusted.
<br>19	Therefore thus saith the Lord: If thou wilt be converted, I will convert thee, and thou shalt stand before my face; and thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not be turned to them.
<br>20	And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass: and they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
<br>21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the
<br> 
<br>hand of the mighty.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons and daughters in this place.
<br>3	For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and daughters, that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them: and concerning their fathers, of whom they were born in this land:
<br>4	They shall die by the death of grievous ill- nesses: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be buried, they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed with the sword, and with famine: and their car- casses shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.
<br>5	For thus saith the Lord: Enter not into the house of feasting, neither go thou to mourn, nor to comfort them: because I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the Lord, my mercy and commiserations.
<br>6	Both the great and the little shall die in this land: they shall not be buried nor lamented, and men shall not cut themselves, nor make them- selves bald for them.
<br>7	And they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth, to comfort him for the dead: neither shall they give them for their fa- ther and mother.
<br>8	And do not thou go into the house of feast- ing, to sit with them, and to eat and drink:
<br>9	For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will take away out of this place in your sight, and in your days the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say to thee: Where- fore hath the Lord pronounced against us all this great evil? what is our iniquity? and what is our sin, that we have sinned against the Lord our God?
<br>11	Thou shalt say to them: Because your fa- thers forsook me, saith the Lord: and went after strange gods, and served them, and adored them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.
<br>12	And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me.
<br>13	So I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land which you know not, nor your fathers: and there you shall serve strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any rest.
<br>14	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it shall be said no more: The Lord liveth, that brought forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
<br>15	But, The Lord liveth, that brought the chil- dren of Israel out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I gave to their fathers.
<br>16	Behold I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks.
<br>17	For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes.
<br>18	And I will repay first their double iniqui- ties, and their sins: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and they have filled my inheritance with their abomina- tions.
<br> 
<br>19	O Lord, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of tribulation: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our fathers have possessed lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.
<br>20	Shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods?
<br>21	Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know, I will shew them my hand and my power: and they shall know that my name is the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>The sin of Juda is written with a pen of iron, with the point of a diamond, it is graven upon the table of their heart, upon the horns of their altars.
<br>2	When their children shall remember their altars, and their groves, and their green trees upon the high mountains,
<br>3	Sacrificing in the field: I will give thy strength, and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin in all thy borders.
<br>4	And thou shalt be left stripped of thy inher- itance, which I gave thee: and I will make thee serve thy enemies in a land which thou know- est not: because thou hast kindled a fire in my wrath, it shall burn for ever.
<br>5	Thus saith the Lord: Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.
<br>6	For he shall be like tamaric in the desert, and he shall not see when good shall come: but he shall dwell in dryness in the desert in a salt land, and not inhabited.
<br>7	Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord shall be his confidence.
<br>8	And he shall be as a tree that is planted by
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the waters, that spreadeth out its roots towards moisture: and it shall not fear when the heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.
<br>9	The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable, who can know it?
<br>10	I am the Lord who search the heart, and prove the reins: who give to every one accord- ing to his way, and according to the fruit of his devices.
<br>11	As the partridge hath hatched eggs which she did not lay: so is he that hath gathered riches, and not by right: in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and in his latter end he shall be a fool.
<br>12	A high and glorious throne from the begin- ning is the place of our sanctification.
<br>13	O Lord, the hope of Israel: all that forsake thee shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth: because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters. 14 Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my
<br>praise.
<br>15	Behold they say to me: Where is the word of the Lord?  let it come.
<br>16	And I am not troubled, following thee for my pastor, and I have not desired the day of man, thou knowest. That which went out of my lips, hath been right in thy sight.
<br>17	Be not thou a terror unto me, thou art my hope in the day of affliction.
<br>18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon them the day of affliction, and with a double de- struction, destroy them.
<br>19	Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and stand
<br> 
<br>in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Juda come in, and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:
<br>20	And thou shalt say to them: Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and al Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates.
<br>21	Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to your souls, and carry no burdens on the sabbath day: and bring them not in by the gates of Jerusalem.
<br>22	And do not bring burdens out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: sanctify the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
<br>23	But they did not hear, nor incline their ear: but hardened their neck, that they might not hear me, and might not receive instruction. 24 And it shall come to pass: if you will hear- ken to me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burdens by the gates of this city on the sabbath day: and if you will sanctify the sabbath day, to do no
<br>work therein:
<br>25	Then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes, sitting upon the throne of David, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
<br>26	And they shall   come   from   the   cities of Juda, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plains, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing holocausts, and victims, and sacrifices, and frankincense, and they shall bring in an offering into the house of the Lord.
<br>27	But if you will not hearken to me, to sanctify the sabbath day, and not to carry bur- dens, and not to bring them in by the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day: I will kin- dle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall de-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>vour the houses of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Arise, and go down into the potterâ€™s house, and there thou shalt hear my words.
<br>3	And I went down into the potterâ€™s house, and behold he was doing a work on the wheel.
<br>4	And the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his hands: and turning he made another vessel, as it seemed good in his eyes to make it.
<br>5	Then the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>6	Cannot I do with you, as this potter, O house of Israel, saith the Lord? behold as clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
<br>7	I will suddenly speak against a nation, and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy it.
<br>8	If that nation against which I have spoken, shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them.
<br>9	And I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom, to build up and plant it.
<br>10	If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice: I will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto it.
<br>11	Now therefore tell the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: let every man of you return from his evil way, and make ye your ways and your doings good.
<br>12	And they said; We have no hopes: for we
<br> 
<br>will go after our own thoughts, and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his evil heart.
<br>13	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Ask among the nations: Who hath heard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done to ex- cess?
<br>14	Shall the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field? or can the cold waters that gush out and run down, be taken away?
<br>15	Because my people have forgotten me, sac- rificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk by them in a way not trodden:
<br>16	That their land might be given up to deso- lation, and to a perpetual hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and wag his head.
<br>17	As a burning wind will I scatter them be- fore the enemy: I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their destruction.
<br>18	And they said: Come, and let us invent devices against Jeremias: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet: come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us give no heed to all his words.
<br>19	Give heed to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my adversaries.
<br>20	Shall evil be rendered for good, because they have digged a pit for my soul? Remember that I have stood in thy sight, to speak good for them, and to turn away thy indignation from them.
<br>21	Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of children and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet.
<br>23	But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto death: not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Thus saith the Lord: Go, and take a potterâ€™s earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests:
<br>2	And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt proclaim the words that I shall tell thee.
<br>3	And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O ye kings of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place: so that whosoever shall hear it, his ears shall tingle:
<br>4	Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this place : and have sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom neither they nor their fa- thers knew, nor the kings of Juda: and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents.
<br>5	And they have built the high places of Baalim, to burn their children with fire for a holocaust to Baalim: which I did not command, nor speak of, neither did it once come into my mind.
<br>6	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom, but the valley of slaughter.
<br> 
<br>7	And I will defeat the counsel of Juda and of Jerusalem in this place: and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.
<br>8	And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
<br>9	And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters: and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their ene- mies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
<br>10	And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that shall go with thee.
<br>11	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Even so will I break this people, and this city, as the potterâ€™s vessel is broken, which cannot be made whole again: and they shall be buried in Topheth, because there is no other place to bury in.
<br>12	Thus will I do to this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as Topheth.
<br>13	And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda shall be unclean as the place of Topheth: all the houses upon whose roofs they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to strange gods.
<br>14	Then Jeremias came from Topheth, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the house of the Lord, and said to all the people:
<br>15	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof all the evils that I have
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>spoken against it: because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>Now Phassur the son of Emmer, the priest, who was appointed chief in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.
<br>2	And Phassur struck Jeremias the prophet, and put him in the stocks, that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, in the house of the Lord.
<br>3	And when it was light the next day, Phas- sur brought Jeremias out of the stocks. And Jeremias said to him: The Lord hath not called thy name Phassur, but fear on every side.
<br>4	For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver thee up to fear, thee and all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it, and I will give all Juda into the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall carry them away to Babylon, and shall strike them with the sword.
<br>5	And I will give all the substance of this city, and all its labour, and every precious thing thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Juda will I give into the hands of their enemies: and they shall pillage them, and take them away, and carry them to Babylon.
<br>6	But thou Phassur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity, and thou shalt go to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there thou shalt be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied a lie.
<br>7	Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I am deceived: thou hast been stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I am become a laughing- stock all the day, all scoff at me.
<br>8	For I am speaking now this long time, cry- ing out against iniquity, and I often proclaim
<br> 
<br>devastation: and the word of the Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the day.
<br>9	Then I said: I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name: and there came in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I was wearied, not being able to bear it.
<br>10	For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the men that were my familiars, and continued at my side: if by any means he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged on him.
<br>11	But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior: therefore they that persecute me shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be greatly confounded, because they have not understood the everlast- ing reproach, which never shall be effaced.
<br>12	And thou, O Lord of hosts, prover of the just, who seest the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.
<br>13	Sing ye to the Lord, praise the Lord: be- cause he hath delivered the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked.
<br>14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me, be blessed.
<br>15	Cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father, saying: A man child is born to thee: and made him greatly rejoice.
<br>16	Let that man be as the cities which the Lord hath overthrown, and hath not repented: let him hear a cry in the morning, and howling at noontide:
<br>17	Who slew me not from the womb, that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb an everlasting conception.
<br>18	Why came I out of the womb, to see labour and sorrow, and that my days should be spent
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>in confusion?
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when king Sedecias sent unto him Phassur, the son of Melchias, and Sophonias, the son of Maasias the priest, saying:
<br>2	Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nabu- chodonosor king of Babylon maketh war against us: if so be the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful works, that he may depart from us.
<br>3	And Jeremias said to them: Thus shall you say to Sedecias:
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Be- hold I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, and with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, that besiege you round about the walls: and I will gather them together in the midst of this city.
<br>5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great wrath.
<br>6	And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, men and beasts shall die of a great pestilence.
<br>7	And after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, and the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword, and he shall not be moved to pity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy to them.
<br>8	And to this people thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
<br> 
<br>9	He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that shall go out and flee over to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and his life shall be to him as a spoil.
<br>10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
<br>11	And to the house of the king of Juda: Hear ye the word of the Lord,
<br>12	O house of David, thus saith the Lord: Judge ye judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand of the oppressor: lest my indignation go forth like a fire, and be kindled, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your ways.
<br>13	Behold I come to thee that dwellest in a valley upon a rock above a plain, saith the Lord: and you say: Who shall strike us and who shall enter into our houses?
<br>14	But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the Lord: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof: and it shall devour all things round about it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>Thus saith the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Juda, and there thou shalt speak this word,
<br>2	And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, king of Juda, that sittest upon the throne of David: thou and thy servants, and thy people, who enter in by these gates.
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord: Execute judgment and justice, and deliver him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor: and afflict not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, nor
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>oppress them unjustly: and shed not innocent blood in this place.
<br>4	For if you will do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house, kings of the race of David sitting upon his throne, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants, and their people.
<br>5	But if you will not hearken to these words: I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation.
<br>6	For thus saith the Lord to the house of the king of Juda: Thou art to me Galaad the head of Libanus: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities not habitable.
<br>7	And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars, and shall cast them headlong into the fire.
<br>8	And many nations shall pass by this city: and they shall say every man to his neighbour: Why hath the Lord done so to this great city?
<br>9	And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and have adored strange gods, and served them.
<br>10	Weep not for him that is dead, nor bemoan him with your tears: lament him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
<br>11	For thus saith the Lord to Sellum the son of Josias the king of Juda, who reigned instead of his father, who went forth out of this place: He shall return hither no more:
<br>12	But in the place, to which I have removed him, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more.
<br>13	Woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice, and his chambers not in judgment: that will oppress his friend without cause, and will not pay him his wages.
<br>14	Who saith: I will build me a wide house,
<br> 
<br>and large chambers: who openeth to himself win- dows, and maketh roofs of cedar, and painteth them with vermilion.
<br>15	Shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and it was then well with him?
<br>16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good: was it not therefore because he knew me, saith the Lord?
<br>17	But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness, and upon shedding innocent blood, and upon oppression, and running after evil works.
<br>18	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda: They shall not mourn for him, Alas, my brother, and, Alas, sister: they shall not lament for him, Alas, my lord, or, Alas, the noble one.
<br>19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, rotten and cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem.
<br>20	Go up to Libanus, and cry: and lift up thy voice in Basan, and cry to them that pass by, for all thy lovers are destroyed.
<br>21	I spoke to thee in thy prosperity: and thou saidst: I will not hear: this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou hast not heard my voice.
<br>22	The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy wicked- ness.
<br>23	Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the cedars, how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee, as the pains of a woman in labour?
<br>24	As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda were a ring on my right hand, I would pluck him thence.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
<br>26	And I will send thee, and thy mother that bore thee, into a strange country, in which you were not born, and there you shall die:
<br>27	And they shall not return into the land, whereunto they lift up their mind to return thither.
<br>28	Is this man Jechonias an earthen and a bro- ken vessel? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
<br>29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.
<br>30	Thus saith the Lord: Write this man bar- ren, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall sit upon the throne of David, and have power any more in Juda.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>Woe to the pastors, that destroy and tear the sheep of my pasture, saith the Lord.
<br>2	Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the pastors that feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold I will visit upon you for the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.
<br>3	And I will gather together the remnant of my flock, out of all the lands into which I have cast them out: and I will make them return to their own fields, and they shall increase and be multiplied.
<br>4	And I will set up pastors over them, and
<br> 
<br>they shall feed them: they shall fear no more, and they shall not be dismayed: and none shall be wanting of their number, saith the Lord.
<br>5	Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will raise up to David a just branch: and a king shall reign, and shall be wise: and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
<br>6	In those days shall Juda be saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the name that they shall call him: The Lord our just one.
<br>7	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and they shall say no more: The Lord liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:
<br>8	But, The Lord liveth, who hath brought out, and brought hither the seed of the house of Israel from the land of the north, and out of all the lands, to which I had cast them forth: and they shall dwell in their own land.
<br>9	To the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones tremble: I am become as a drunken man, and as a man full of wine, at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his holy words.
<br>10	Because the land is full of adulterers, be- cause the land hath mourned by reason of curs- ing, the fields of the desert are dried up: and their course is become evil, and their strength unlike.
<br>11	For the prophet and the priest are defiled: and in my house I have found their wickedness, saith the Lord.
<br>12	Therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the dark: for they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evils upon them, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
<br>13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied in Baal and deceived my people Israel.
<br>14	And I have seen the likeness of adulter-
