<br>§1452. Special requirements for incentive auction of broadcast TV spectrum
<br>(a) Reverse auction to identify incentive amount
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission shall conduct a reverse auction to determine the amount of compensation that each broadcast television licensee would accept in return for voluntarily relinquishing some or all of its broadcast television spectrum usage rights in order to make spectrum available for assignment through a system of competitive bidding under subparagraph (G) of section 309(j)(8) of this title.
<br>(2) Eligible relinquishments
<br>
<br>A relinquishment of usage rights for purposes of paragraph (1) shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Relinquishing all usage rights with respect to a particular television channel without receiving in return any usage rights with respect to another television channel.

<br>
<br>(C) Relinquishing usage rights in order to share a television channel with another licensee.
<br>(3) Confidentiality
<br>
<br>The Commission shall take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the confidentiality of Commission-held data of a licensee participating in the reverse auction under paragraph (1), including withholding the identity of such licensee until the reassignments and reallocations (if any) under subsection (b)(1)(B) become effective, as described in subsection (f)(2).
<br>(4) Protection of carriage rights of licensees sharing a channel
<br>
<br>A broadcast television station that voluntarily relinquishes spectrum usage rights under this subsection in order to share a television channel and that possessed carriage rights under section 338, 534, or 535 of this title on November 30, 2010, shall have, at its shared location, the carriage rights under such section that would apply to such station at such location if it were not sharing a channel.
<br>(b) Reorganization of broadcast TV spectrum
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of making available spectrum to carry out the forward auction under subsection (c)(1), the Commission—
<br>
<br>(A) shall evaluate the broadcast television spectrum (including spectrum made available through the reverse auction under subsection (a)(1)); and
<br>
<br>(B) may, subject to international coordination along the border with Mexico and Canada—
<br>
<br>(i) make such reassignments of television channels as the Commission considers appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(ii) reallocate such portions of such spectrum as the Commission determines are available for reallocation.
<br>(2) Factors for consideration
<br>
<br>In making any reassignments or reallocations under paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall make all reasonable efforts to preserve, as of February 22, 2012, the coverage area and population served of each broadcast television licensee, as determined using the methodology described in OET Bulletin 69 of the Office of Engineering and Technology of the Commission.

<br>
<br>(B) from a television channel between the frequencies from 174 megahertz to 216 megahertz to a television channel between the frequencies from 54 megahertz to 88 megahertz.
<br>(4) Payment of relocation costs
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from amounts made available under subsection (d)(2), the Commission shall reimburse costs reasonably incurred by—
<br>
<br>(i) a broadcast television licensee that was reassigned under paragraph (1)(B)(i) from one ultra high frequency television channel to a different ultra high frequency television channel, from one very high frequency television channel to a different very high frequency television channel, or, in accordance with subsection (g)(1)(B), from a very high frequency television channel to an ultra high frequency television channel, in order for the licensee to relocate its television service from one channel to the other;
<br>
<br>(ii) a multichannel video programming distributor in order to continue to carry the signal of a broadcast television licensee that—
<br>
<br>(I) is described in clause (i);
<br>
<br>(II) voluntarily relinquishes spectrum usage rights under subsection (a) with respect to an ultra high frequency television channel in return for receiving usage rights with respect to a very high frequency television channel; or
<br>
<br>(III) voluntarily relinquishes spectrum usage rights under subsection (a) to share a television channel with another licensee; or
<br>
<br>(iii) a channel 37 incumbent user, in order to relocate to other suitable spectrum, provided that all such users can be relocated and that the total relocation costs of such users do not exceed $300,000,000. For the purpose of this section, the spectrum made available through relocation of channel 37 incumbent users shall be deemed as spectrum reclaimed through a reverse auction under subsection (a).
<br>(B) Regulatory relief
<br>
<br>In lieu of reimbursement for relocation costs under subparagraph (A), a broadcast television licensee may accept, and the Commission may grant as it considers appropriate, a waiver of the service rules of the Commission to permit the licensee, subject to interference protections, to make flexible use of the spectrum assigned to the licensee to provide services other than broadcast television services. Such waiver shall only remain in effect while the licensee provides at least 1 broadcast television program stream on such spectrum at no charge to the public.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>The Commission may not make reimbursements under subparagraph (A) for lost revenues.
<br>(D) Deadline
