<br>§687a. Revocation and suspension of licenses; cease and desist orders
<br>(a) Grounds for suspension or revocation
<br>
<br>A license may be revoked or suspended by the Administration—
<br>
<br>(1) for false statements knowingly made in any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administration;
<br>
<br>(2) if any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administrator, fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which the statement was made;
<br>
<br>(3) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(4) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any rule or regulation of the Administration authorized by this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(5) for violation of, or failure to observe, any cease and desist order issued by the Administration under this section.
<br>(b) Grounds for cease and desist order
<br>
<br>Where a licensee or any other person has not complied with any provision of this chapter, or of any regulation issued pursuant thereto by the Administration, or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of such chapter or regulation, the Administration may order such licensee or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administration may further order such licensee or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administration deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter and the regulations. The Administration may also suspend the license of a licensee, against whom an order has been issued, until such licensee complies with such order.
<br>(c) Order to show cause; contents; hearing; issuance and service
<br>
<br>Before revoking or suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a), or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall serve upon the licensee and any other person involved an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee and any other person involved.
<br>(d) Subpena of person, and books, papers and documents; fees and mileage; enforcement
<br>
<br>The Administration may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, and documents relating to the hearing from any place in the United States. Witnesses summoned before the Administration shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Administration, or any party to a proceeding before the Administration, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents.
<br>(e) Petition to modify or set aside order; filing, time and place, Administration to submit record; action of court; review
<br>
<br>An order issued by the Administration under this section shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days after the service thereof the licensee, or other person against whom an order is issued, appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such licensee has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the Administration's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition. After the expiration of such thirty days, a petition may be filed only by leave of court on a showing of reasonable grounds for failure to file the petition theretofore. The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Administration, and the Administration shall thereupon certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Administration. If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the Administration to reopen the hearing for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Administration may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the record of such additional evidence. No objection to an order of the Administration shall be considered by the court unless such objection was urged before the Administration or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside any such order of the Administration shall be subject only to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certification or certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
<br>(f) Enforcement of order
<br>
<br>If any licensee or other person against which or against whom an order is issued under this section fails to obey the order, the Administration may apply to the United States court of appeals, within the circuit where the licensee has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of the application the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the licensee or other person. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in subsection (e) for applications to set aside or modify orders.

<br>The Administration may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a licensee, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.

Fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and are authorized to be appropriated solely to cover the costs of examinations and other program oversight activities. Every such company shall make such reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require; except that the Administration is authorized to exempt from making such reports any such company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.] to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in reporting requirements.
<br>(c) Examinations of small business investment companies

<br>(7) it has charged an interest rate in excess of the maximum permitted by law:
<br>
<br>Provided, That the Administration may waive the examination (A) for up to one additional year if, in its discretion, it determines such a delay would be appropriate, based upon the amount of debentures being issued by the company and its repayment record, the prior operating experience of the company, the contents and results of the last examination and the management expertise of the company, or (B) if it is a company whose operations have been suspended while the company is involved in litigation or is in receivership.

<br>
<br>Each licensee shall submit to the Administrator a written valuation of the loans and investments of the licensee not less often than semiannually or otherwise upon the request of the Administrator, except that any licensee with no leverage outstanding shall submit such valuations annually, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
<br>(B) Material adverse changes
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the end of a fiscal quarter of a licensee during which a material adverse change in the aggregate valuation of the loans and investments or operations of the licensee occurs, the licensee shall notify the Administrator in writing of the nature and extent of that change.
<br>(C) Independent certification
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Not less than once during each fiscal year, each licensee shall submit to the Administrator the financial statements of the licensee, audited by an independent certified public accountant approved by the Administrator.

<br>(b) Terms and conditions of guarantee; payment of principal and interest
<br>
<br>The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this section.

<br>
<br>(1) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this section, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.
<br>
<br>(2) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the debentures or participating securities residing in a trust or pool against which trust certificates are issued.
<br>(f) Central registration requirements; regulation of brokers and dealers
<br>
<br>(1) The Administration shall provide for a central registration of all trust certificates sold pursuant to this section.

Such agent or agents shall provide a fidelity bond or insurance in such amounts as the Administration determines to be necessary to fully protect the interests of the Government.
