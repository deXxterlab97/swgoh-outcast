<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>The wise man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, and will be occupied in the prophets.
<br>2	He will keep the sayings of renowned men, and will enter withal into the subtilties of para- bles.
<br>3	He will search out the hidden meanings of proverbs, and will be conversant in the secrets of parables.
<br>4	He shall serve among great men, and appear before the governor.
<br>5	He shall pass into strange countries: for he shall try good and evil among men.
<br>6	He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and he will pray in the sight of the most High.
<br>7	He will open his mouth in prayer, and will make supplication for his sins.
<br>8	For if it shall please the great Lord, he will fill him with the spirit of understanding:
<br>9	And he will pour forth the words of his wis- dom as showers, and in his prayer he will confess to the Lord.
<br>10	And he shall direct his counsel, and his knowledge, and in his secrets shall he meditate.
<br>11	He shall shew forth the discipline he hath learned, and shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>12	Many shall praise his wisdom, and it shall never be forgotten.
<br>13	The memory of him shall not depart away, and his name shall be in request from generation to generation.
<br>14	Nations shall declare his wisdom, and the church shall shew forth his praise.
<br>15	If he continue, he shall leave a name above a thousand: and if he rest, it shall be to his advantage.
<br>16	I will yet meditate that I may declare: for I am filled as with a holy transport.
<br>17	By a voice he saith: Hear me, ye divine offspring, and bud forth as the rose planted by the brooks of waters.
<br>18	Give ye a sweet odour as frankincense.
<br>19	Send forth flowers, as the lily, and yield a smell, and bring forth leaves in grace, and praise with canticles, and bless the Lord in his works.
<br>20	Magnify his name, and give glory to him with the voice of your lips, and with the canticles of your mouths, and with harps, and in praising him, you shall say in this manner:
<br>21	All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.
<br>22	At his word the waters stood as a heap: and at the words of his mouth the receptacles of waters:
<br>23	For at his commandment favour is shewn, and there is no diminishing of his salvation.
<br>24	The works of all flesh are before him, and there is nothing hid from his eyes.
<br>25	He seeth from eternity to eternity, and there is nothing wonderful before him.
<br>26	There is no saying: What is this, or what is that? for all things shall be sought in their time.
<br>27	His blessing hath overflowed like a river.
<br>28	And as a flood hath watered the earth; so shall his wrath inherit the nations, that have not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sought after him.
<br>29	Even as he turned the waters into a dry land, and the earth was made dry: and his ways were made plain for their journey: so to sinners they are stumblingblocks in his wrath.
<br>30	Good things were created for the good from the beginning, so for the wicked, good and evil things.
<br>31	The principal things necessary for the life of men, are water, fire, and iron, salt, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the cluster of the grape, and oil, and clothing.
<br>32	All these things shall be for good to the holy, so to the sinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil.
<br>33	There are spirits that are created for vengeance, and in their fury they lay on grievous torments.
<br>34	In the time of destruction they shall pour out their force: and they shall appease the wrath of him that made them.
<br>35	Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance.
<br>36	The teeth of beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and the sword taking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction.
<br>37	In his commandments they shall feast, and they shall be ready upon earth when need is, and when their time is come they shall not transgress his word.
<br>38	Therefore from the beginning I was re- solved, and I have meditated, and thought on these things and left them in writing,
<br>39	All the works of the Lord are good, and he will furnish every work in due time.
<br>40	It is not to be said: This is worse than that: for all shall be well approved in their time.
<br>41	Now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him, and bless the name of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 40
<br>
<br>Great labour is created for all men, and a heavy yoke is upon the children of Adam from the day of their coming out of their mother’s womb, until the day of their burial into the mother of all.
<br>2	Their thoughts, and fears of the heart, their imagination of things to come, and the day of their end:
<br>3	From him that sitteth on a glorious throne, unto him that is humbled in earth and ashes:
<br>4	From him that weareth purple, and beareth the crown, even to him that is covered with rough linen: wrath, envy, trouble, unquietness, and the fear of death, continual anger, and strife, 5 And in the time of rest upon his bed, the
<br>sleep of the night changeth his knowledge.
<br>6	A little and as nothing is his rest, and after- ward in sleep, as in the day of keeping watch.
<br>7	He is troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he had escaped in the day of battle. In the time of his safety he rose up, and wondereth that there is no fear.
<br>8	Such things happen to all flesh, from man even to beast, and upon sinners are sevenfold more.
<br>9	Moreover, death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, oppressions, famine, and affliction, and scourges:
<br>10	All these things are created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood.
<br>11	All things that are of the earth, shall return to the earth again, and all waters shall return to the sea.
<br>12	All bribery, and injustice shall be blotted out, and fidelity shall stand for ever.
<br>13	The riches of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, and shall pass away with a noise like a great thunder in rain.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	While he openeth his hands he shall rejoice: but transgressors shall pine away in the end.
<br>15	The offspring of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches, and make a noise as un- clean roots upon the top of a rock.
<br>16	The weed growing over every water, and at the bank of the river, shall be pulled up before all grass.
<br>17	Grace is like a paradise in blessings, and mercy remaineth for ever.
<br>18	The life of a laborer that is content with what he hath, shall be sweet, and in it thou shalt find a treasure.
<br>19	Children, and the building of a city shall establish a name, but a blameless wife shall be counted above them both.
<br>20	Wine and music rejoice the heart, but the love of wisdom is above them both.
<br>21	The flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody, but a pleasant tongue is above them both.
<br>22	Thy eye desireth favour and beauty, but more than these green sown fields.
<br>23	A friend and companion meeting together in season, but above them both is a wife with her husband.
<br>24	Brethren are a help in the time of trouble, but mercy shall deliver more than they.
<br>25	Gold and silver make the feet stand sure: but wise counsel is above them both.
<br>26	Riches and strength lift up the heart: but above these is the fear of the Lord.
<br>27	There is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek for help.
<br>28	The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing, and they have covered it above all glory. 29 My son, in thy lifetime be not indigent: for
<br>it is better to die than to want.
<br>30 The life of him that looketh toward another man’s table is not to be counted a life: for he
<br> 
<br>feedeth his soul with another man’s meat.
<br>31	But a man, well instructed and taught, will look to himself.
<br>32	Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise, but in his belly there shall burn a fire.
<br>
<br>Chapter 41
<br>
<br>O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions!
<br>2	To a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!
<br>3	O death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need, and to him whose strength faileth:
<br>4	Who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that los- eth patience!
<br>5	Fear not the sentence of death. Remem- ber what things have been before thee, and what shall come after thee: this sentence is from the Lord upon all flesh.
<br>6	And what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most High? whether ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years.
<br>7	For among the dead there is no accusing of life.
<br>8	The children of sinners become children of abominations, and they that converse near the houses of the ungodly.
<br>9	The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach.
<br>10	The children will complain of an ungodly father, because for his sake they are in reproach. 11 Woe to you, ungodly men, who have for-
<br>saken the law of the most high Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And if you be born, you shall be born in malediction: and if you die, in malediction shall be your portion.
<br>13	All things that are of the earth, shall re- turn into the earth: so the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction.
<br>14	The mourning of men is about their body, but the name of the ungodly shall be blotted out. 15 Take care of a good name: for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand trea-
<br>sures precious and great.
<br>16	A good life hath its number of days: but a good name shall continue for ever.
<br>17	My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is there in them both?
<br>18	Better is the man that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.
<br>19	Wherefore have a shame of these things I am now going to speak of.
<br>20	For it is not good to keep all shamefaced- ness: and all things do not please all men in opinion.
<br>21	Be ashamed of fornication before father and mother: and of a lie before a governor and a man in power:
<br>22	Of an offence before a prince, and a judge: of iniquity before a congregation and a people:
<br>23	Of injustice before a companion and friend: and in regard to the place where thou dwellest, 24 Of theft, and of the truth of God, and the covenant: of leaning with thy elbow over meat,
<br>and of deceit in giving and taking:
<br>25	Of silence before them that salute thee: of looking upon a harlot: and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman.
<br>26	Turn not away thy face from thy neighbour, and of taking away a portion and not restoring. 27 Gaze not upon another man’s wife, and be not inquisitive after his handmaid, and approach
<br> 
<br>not her bed.
<br>28 Be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends: and after thou hast given, upbraid not.
<br>
<br>Chapter 42
<br>
<br>Repeat not the word which thou hast heard, and disclose not the thing that is secret; so shalt thou be truly without confusion, and shalt find favour before all men: be not ashamed of any of these things, and accept no person to sin thereby:
<br>2	Of the law of the most High, and of his covenant, and of judgment to justify the un- godly:
<br>3	Of the affair of companions and travellers, and of the gift of the inheritance of friends:
<br>4	Of exactness of balance and weights, of get- ting much or little:
<br>5	Of the corruption of buying, and of mer- chants, and of much correction of children, and to make the side of a wicked slave to bleed.
<br>6	Sure keeping is good over a wicked wife.
<br>7	Where there are many hands, shut up, and deliver all things in number, and weight: and put all in writing that thou givest out or receivest in. 8 Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the aged, that are judged by young men: and thou shalt be well instructed in all things, and well approved in the sight of all men
<br>living.
<br>9	The father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth, and the care for her taketh away his sleep, when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age, and when she is married, lest she should be hateful:
<br>10	In her virginity, lest she should be cor- rupted, and be found with child in her father’s house: and having a husband, lest she should
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>misbehave herself, or at the least become bar- ren.
<br>11	Keep a sure watch over a shameless daugh- ter: lest at anytime she make thee become a laughingstock to thy enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and she make thee ashamed before all the multitude. 12 Behold not everybody’s beauty: and tarry
<br>not among women.
<br>13	For from garments cometh a moth, and from a woman the iniquity of a man.
<br>14	For better is the iniquity of a man, than a woman doing a good turn, and a woman bringing shame and reproach.
<br>15	I will now remember the works of the Lord, and I will declare the things I have seen. By the words of the Lord are his works.
<br>16	The sun giving light hath looked upon all things, and full of the glory of the Lord is his work.
<br>17	Hath not the Lord made the saints to de- clare all his wonderful works, which the Lord Almighty hath firmly settled to be established for his glory?
<br>18	He hath searched out the deep, and the heart of men: and considered their crafty de- vices.
<br>19	For the Lord knoweth all knowledge, and hath beheld the signs of the world, he declareth the things that are past, and the things that are to come, and revealeth the traces of hidden things.
<br>20	No thought escapeth him, and no word can hide itself from him.
<br>21	He hath beautified the glorious works of his wisdom: and he is from eternity to eternity, and to him nothing may be added,
<br>22	Nor can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.
<br> 
<br>23	O how desirable are all his works, and what we can know is but as a spark!
<br>24	All these things live, and remain for ever, and for every use all things obey him.
<br>25	All things are double, one against another, and he hath made nothing defective.
<br>26	He hath established the good things of ev- ery one. And who shall be filled with beholding his glory?
<br>
<br>Chapter 43
<br>The firmament on high is his beauty, the beauty of heaven with its glorious shew.
<br>2	The sun when he appeareth shewing forth at his rising, an admirable instrument, the work of the most High.
<br>3	At noon he burneth the earth, and who can abide his burning heat? As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:
<br>4	The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.
<br>5	Great is the Lord that made him, and at his words he hath hastened his course.
<br>6	And the moon in all in her season, is for a declaration of times and a sign of the world.
<br>7	From the moon is the sign of the festival day, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.
<br>8	The month is called after her name, increas- ing wonderfully in her perfection.
<br>9	Being an instrument of the armies on high, shining gloriously in the firmament of heaven.
<br>10	The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven; the Lord enlighteneth the world on high. 11 By the words of the holy one they stand in
<br>judgment, and shall never fall in their watches.
<br>12	Look upon the rainbow, and bless him that made it: it is very beautiful in its brightness.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	It encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory, the hands of the most High have displayed it.
<br>14	By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, and sendeth forth swiftly the light- nings of his judgment.
<br>15	Through this are the treasures opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.
<br>16	By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds, and the hailstones are broken.
<br>17	At his sight shall the mountains be shaken, and at his will the south wind shall blow.
<br>18	The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth, so doth the northern storm, and the whirl- wind:
<br>19	And as the birds lighting upon the earth, he scattereth snow, and the falling thereof, is as the coming down of locusts.
<br>20	The eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the shower thereof.
<br>21	He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth: and when it freezeth, it shall become like the tops of thistles.
<br>22	The cold north wind bloweth, and the wa- ter is congealed into crystal; upon every gath- ering together of waters it shall rest, and shall clothe the waters as a breastplate.
<br>23	And it shall devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and consume all that is green as with fire.
<br>24	A present remedy of all is the speedy com- ing of a cloud, and a dew that meeteth it, by the heat that cometh, shall overpower it.
<br>25	At his word the wind is still, and with his thought he appeaseth the deep, and the Lord hath planted islands therein.
<br>26	Let them that sail on the sea, tell the dan- gers thereof: and when we hear with our ears, we shall admire.
<br> 
<br>27	There are great and wonderful works: a variety of beasts, and of all living things, and the monstrous creatures of whales.
<br>28	Through him is established the end of their journey, and by his word all things are regulated.
<br>29	We shall say much, and yet shall want words: but the sum of our words is, He is all.
<br>30	What shall we be able to do to glorify him? for the Almighty himself is above all his works.
<br>31	The Lord is terrible, and exceeding great, and his power is admirable.
<br>32	Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can, for he will yet far exceed, and his magnificence is wonderful.
<br>33	Blessing the Lord, exalt him as much as you can; for he is above all praise.
<br>34	When you exalt him put forth all your strength, and be not weary: for you can never go far enough.
<br>35	Who shall see him, and declare him? and who shall magnify him as he is from the begin- ning?
<br>36	There are many things hidden from us that are greater than these: for we have seen but a few of his works.
<br>37	But the Lord hath made all things, and to the godly he hath given wisdom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 44
<br>
<br>Let us now praise men of renown and our fathers in their generation.
<br>2	The Lord hath wrought great glory through his magnificence from the beginning.
<br>3	Such as have borne rule in their dominions, men of great power, and endued with their wis- dom, shewing forth in the prophets the dignity of prophets,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	And ruling over the present people, and by the strength of wisdom instructing the people in most holy words.
<br>5	Such as by their skill sought out musical tunes, and published canticles of the scriptures. 6 Rich men in virtue, studying beautifulness:
<br>living at peace in their houses.
<br>7	All these have gained glory in their genera- tions, and were praised in their days.
<br>8	They that were born of them have left a name behind them, that their praises might be related:
<br>9	And there are some, of whom there is no memorial: who are perished, as if they had never been: and are become as if they had never been born, and their children with them.
<br>10	But these were men of mercy, whose godly deeds have not failed:
<br>11	Good things continue with their seed,
<br>12	Their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed hath stood in the covenants.
<br>13	And their children for their sakes remain for ever: their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken.
<br>14	Their bodies are buried in peace, and their name liveth unto generation and generation.
<br>15	Let the people shew forth their wisdom, and the church declare their praise.
<br>16	Henoch pleased God, and was translated into paradise, that he may give repentance to the nations.
<br>17	Noe was found perfect, just, and in the time of wrath he was made a reconciliation.
<br>18	Therefore was there a remnant left to the earth, when the flood came.
<br>19	The covenants of the world were made with him, that all flesh should no more be destroyed with the flood.
<br>20	Abraham was the great father of a multi- tude of nations, and there was not found the like
<br> 
<br>to him in glory, who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant with him.
<br>21	In his flesh he established the covenant, and in temptation he was found faithful.
<br>22	Therefore by an oath he gave him glory in his posterity, that he should increase as the dust of the earth,
<br>23	And that he would exalt his seed as the stars, and they should inherit from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
<br>24	And he did in like manner with Isaac for the sake of Abraham his father.
<br>25	The Lord gave him the blessing of all na- tions, and confirmed his covenant upon the head of Jacob.
<br>26	He acknowledged him in his blessings, and gave him an inheritance, and divided him his portion in twelve tribes.
<br>27	And he preserved for him men of mercy, that found grace in the eyes of all flesh.
<br>
<br>Chapter 45
<br>Moses was beloved of God, and men: whose memory is in benediction.
<br>2	He made him like the saints in glory, and magnified him in the fear of his enemies, and with his words he made prodigies to cease.
<br>3	He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him commandments in the sight of his peo- ple, and shewed him his glory.
<br>4	He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh.
<br>5	For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a cloud.
<br>6	And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant, and Israel his judgments.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi:
<br>8	He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in glory,
<br>9	And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire.
<br>10	He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and an ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round about,
<br>11	That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the tem- ple, for a memorial to the children of his people. 12 He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a woven work of a wise man, endued
<br>with judgment and truth:
<br>13	Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
<br>14	And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour: a work of power, and delightful to the eyes for its beauty.
<br>15	Before him there were none so beautiful, even from the beginning.
<br>16	No stranger was ever clothed with them, but only his children alone, and his grandchil- dren for ever.
<br>17	His sacrifices were consumed with fire every day.
<br>18	Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil.
<br>19	This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his name. 20 He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to God, incense, and a good savour, for
<br> 
<br>a memorial to make reconciliation for his people: 21 And he gave him power in his command- ments, in the covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his testimonies, and give
<br>light to Israel in his law.
<br>22	And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the wilder- ness, and the congregation of Core in their wrath.
<br>23	The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were consumed in his wrathful indig- nation.
<br>24	He wrought wonders upon them, and con- sumed them with a flame of fire.
<br>25	And he added glory to Aaron, and gave him an inheritance, and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth.
<br>26	He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness: for the sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat, which he gave to him, and to his seed.
<br>27	But he shall not inherit among the people in the land, and he hath no portion among the people: for he himself is his portion and inheri- tance.
<br>28	Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord:
<br>29	And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people: in the goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel.
<br>30	Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever.
<br>31	And a covenant to David the king, the son of Jesse of the tribe of Juda, an inheritance to him and to his seed, that he might give wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice, that their good things might not be abolished, and he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>made their glory in their nation everlasting.
<br>
<br>Chapter 46
<br>Valiant in war was Jesus the son of Nave, who was successor of Moses among the prophets, who was great according to his name,
<br>2	Very great for the saving the elect of God, to overthrow the enemies that rose up against them, that he might get the inheritance for Is- rael.
<br>3	How great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands, and stretched out swords against the cities?
<br>4	Who before him hath so resisted? for the Lord himself brought the enemies.
<br>5	Was not the sun stopped in his anger, and one day made as two?
<br>6	He called upon the most high Sovereign when the enemies assaulted him on every side, and the great and holy God heard him by hail- stones of exceeding great force.
<br>7	He made a violent assault against the nation of his enemies, and in the descent he destroyed the adversaries.
<br>8	That the nations might know his power, that it is not easy to fight against God. And he fol- lowed the mighty one:
<br>9	And in the days of Moses he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephone, in standing against the enemy, and withholding the people from sins, and appeasing the wicked mur- muring.
<br>10	And they two being appointed, were deliv- ered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey.
<br>11	And the Lord gave strength also to Caleb,
<br> 
<br>and his strength continued even to his old age, so that he went up to the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an inheritance:
<br>12	That all the children of Israel might see, that it is good to obey the holy God.
<br>13	Then all the judges, every one by name, whose heart was not corrupted: who turned not away from the Lord,
<br>14	That their memory might be blessed, and their bones spring up out of their place,
<br>15	And their name continue for ever, the glory of the holy men remaining unto their children.
<br>16	Samuel the prophet of the Lord, the beloved of the Lord his God, established a new government, and anointed princes over his peo- ple.
<br>17	By the law of the Lord he judged the con- gregation, and the God of Jacob beheld, and by his fidelity he was proved a prophet.
<br>18	And he was known to be faithful in his words, because he saw the God of light:
<br>19	And called upon the name of the Lord Almighty, in fighting against the enemies who beset him on every side, when he offered a lamb without blemish.
<br>20	And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.
<br>21	And he crushed the princes of the Tyrians, and all the lords of the Philistines:
<br>22	And before the time of the end of his life in the world, he protested before the Lord, and his anointed: money, or any thing else, even to a shoe, he had not taken of any man, and no man did accuse him.
<br>23	And after this he slept, and he made known to the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the na- tion.

<br>Chapter 47
<br>
<br>Then Nathan the prophet arose in the days of David.
<br>2	And as the fat taken away from the flesh, so was David chosen from among the children of Israel.
<br>3	He played with lions as with lambs: and with bears he did in like manner as with the lambs of the flock, in his youth.
<br>4	Did not he kill the giant, and take away reproach from his people?
<br>5	In lifting up his hand, with the stone in the sling he beat down the boasting of Goliath:
<br>6	For he called upon the Lord the Almighty, and he gave strength in his right hand, to take away the mighty warrior, and to set up the horn of his nation.
<br>7	So in ten thousand did he glorify him, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in of- fering to him a crown of glory:
<br>8	For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and extirpated the Philistines the adversaries unto this day: he broke their horn for ever.
<br>9	In all his works he gave thanks to the holy one, and to the most High, with words of glory. 10 With his whole heart he praised the Lord, and loved God that made him: and he gave him
<br>power against his enemies:
<br>11	And he set singers before the altar, and by their voices he made sweet melody.
<br>12	And to the festivals he added beauty, and set in order the solemn times even to the end of his life, that they should praise the holy name of the Lord, and magnify the holiness of God in the morning.
<br>13	The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever: and he gave him a covenant of the kingdom, and a throne of glory in Israel.
<br> 
<br>14	After him arose up a wise son, and for his sake he cast down all the power of the enemies. 15 Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God brought all his enemies under him, that he might build a house in his name, and prepare a sanctu- ary for ever: O how wise wast thou in thy youth! 16 And thou wast filled as a river with wis-
<br>dom, and thy soul covered the earth.
<br>17	And thou didst multiply riddles in para- bles: thy name went abroad to the islands far off, and thou wast beloved in thy peace.
<br>18	The countries wondered at thee for thy can- ticles, and proverbs, and parables, and interpre- tations,
<br>19	And at the name of the Lord God, whose surname is, God of Israel.
<br>20	Thou didst gather gold as copper, and didst multiply silver as lead,
<br>21	And thou didst bow thyself to women: and by thy body thou wast brought under subjection. 22 Thou hast stained thy glory, and defiled thy seed so as to bring wrath upon thy children,
<br>and to have thy folly kindled,
<br>23	That thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided, and out of Ephraim a rebellious king- dom to rule.
<br>24	But God will not leave off his mercy, and he will not destroy, nor abolish his own works, neither will he cut up by the roots the offspring of his elect: and he will not utterly take away the seed of him that loveth the Lord.
<br>25	Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David of the same stock.
<br>26	And Solomon had an end with his fathers.
<br>27	And he left behind him of his seed, the folly of the nation,
<br>28	Even Roboam that had little wisdom, who turned away the people through his counsel:
<br>29	And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>way of sin, and their sins were multiplied ex- ceedingly.
<br>30	They removed them far away from their land.
<br>31	And they sought out all iniquities, till vengeance came upon them, and put an end to all their sins.
<br>And Elias the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch.
<br>2	He brought a famine upon them, and they that provoked him in their envy, were reduced to a small number, for they could not endure the commandments of the Lord.
<br>3	By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and he brought down fire from heaven thrice.
<br>4	Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works. And who can glory like to thee?
<br>5	Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of death, by the word of the Lord God.
<br>6	Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest easily their power in pieces, and the glorious from their bed.
<br>7	Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments of vengeance.
<br>8	Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets successors after thee.
<br>9	Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses.
<br>10	Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the wrath of the Lord, to rec- oncile the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.
<br>11	Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with thy friendship.
<br>12	For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not be such.
<br>13	Elias was indeed covered with the whirl- wind, and his spirit was filled up in Eliseus: in
<br> 
<br>his days he feared not the prince, and no man was more powerful than he.
<br>14	No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied.
<br>15	In his life he did great wonders, and in death he wrought miracles.
<br>16	For all this the people repented not, neither did they depart from their sins till they were cast out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth.
<br>17	And there was left but a small people, and a prince in the house of David.
<br>18	Some of these did that which pleased God: but others committed many sins.
<br>19	Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water.
<br>20	In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion, and became proud through his power.
<br>21	Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in pain as women in travail.
<br>22	And they called upon the Lord who is mer- ciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice.
<br>23	He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy prophet.
<br>24	He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the Lord destroyed them.
<br>25	For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in the way of David his fa- ther, which Isaias, the great prophet, and faith- ful in the sight of God, had commanded him.
<br>26	In his days the sun wen backward, and he lengthened the king’s life.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>27	With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass at last, and comforted the mourners in Sion.
<br>28	He showed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things before they came.
<br>
<br>Chapter 49
<br>The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made by the art of a perfumer:
<br>2 His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine. 3 He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abomina-
<br>tions of wickedness.
<br>4	And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened god- liness.
<br>5	Except David, and Ezechias and Josias, all committed sin.
<br>6	For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God.
<br>7	So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation,
<br>8	They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias.
<br>9	For they treated him evil, who was conse- crated a prophet from his mother’s womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew.
<br>10	It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vi- sion, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.
<br>11	For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.
<br>12	And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place: for they strength-
<br> 
<br>ened Jacob, and redeemed themselves by strong faith.
<br>13	How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on the right hand;
<br>14	In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory.
<br>15	And let Nehemias be a long time remem- bered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses.
<br>16	No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was taken up from the earth.
<br>17	Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people:
<br>18	And his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied.
<br>19	Seth and Sem obtained glory among men: and above every soul Adam in the beginning,
<br>
<br>Chapter 50
<br>
<br>Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life propped up the house, and in his days fortified the temple.
<br>2	By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple.
<br>3	In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.
<br>4	He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.
<br>5	He prevailed to enlarge the city, and ob- tained glory in his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the house and the court.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full. 7 And as the sun when it shineth, so did he
<br>shine in the temple of God.
<br>8	And as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer.
<br>9	As a bright fire, and frankincense burning in the fire.
<br>10	As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone.
<br>11	As an olive tree budding forth, and a cy- press tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the per- fection of power.
<br>12	When he went up to the holy altar, he hon- oured the vesture of holiness.
<br>13	And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the al- tar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus,
<br>14	And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.
<br>15	And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high King,
<br>16	He stretched forth his hand to make a li- bation, and offered of the blood of the grape.
<br>17	He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince.
<br>18	Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God. 19 Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to
<br> 
<br>adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High.
<br>20	And the singers lifted up their voices, and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.
<br>21	And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High, until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished their office.
<br>22	Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with his lips, and to glory in his name:
<br>23	And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God.
<br>24	And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother’s womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.
<br>25 May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be peace in our days in Israel for ever:
<br>26	That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days.
<br>27	There are two nations which my soul ab- horreth: and the third is no nation: which I hate:
<br>28	They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem.
<br>29	Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed wisdom from his heart.
<br>30	Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise always.
<br>31	For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things: because the light of God guideth his steps.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 51
<br>A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.
<br>2	I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.
<br>3	And hast preserved my body from destruc- tion, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.
<br>4	And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.
<br>5	Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which com- passed me about:
<br>6	From the oppression of the flame which sur- rounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.
<br>7	From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:
<br>8	My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.
<br>9	And my life was drawing near to hell be- neath.
<br>10	They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.
<br>11	I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world.
<br>12	How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations.
<br>13	Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away.
<br>14	I called upon the Lord, the father of my
<br> 
<br>Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help.
<br>15	I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.
<br>16	And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time.
<br>17	Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.
<br>18	When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer. 19 I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flour-
<br>ished as a grape soon ripe.
<br>20	My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her.
<br>21	I bowed down my ear a little, and received her.
<br>22	I found much wisdom in myself, and prof- ited much therein.
<br>23	To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory.
<br>24	For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded. 25 My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing
<br>it I have been confirmed.
<br>26	I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her.
<br>27	I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her.
<br>28	I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.
<br>29	My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.
<br>30	The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.
<br>31	Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the hours of discipline.
<br> 
<br>
<br>32	Why are ye slow and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty.
<br>33	I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,
<br>34	And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.
<br>35	Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.
<br>36	Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.
<br>37	Let your soul rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be confounded in his praise.
<br>38	Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.

<br>
<br>Prophecy of Isaias
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The vision of Isaias the Son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.
<br>2	Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up chil- dren, and exalted them: but they have despised me.
<br>3	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.
<br>4	Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blas- phemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.
<br>5	For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.
<br>6	From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.
<br>7	Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.
<br>8	And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden
<br> 
<br>of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.
<br>9	Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.
<br>10	Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.
<br>11	To what purpose do you offer me the multi- tude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats. 12 When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that  you
<br>should walk in my courts?
<br>13	Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination to me. The new moons, and the sabbaths and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.
<br>14	My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.
<br>15	And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.
<br>16	Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes, cease to do perversely,
<br>17	Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.
<br>19	If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.
<br>20	But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
<br>21	How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.
<br>22	Thy silver is turned into dross: thy wine is mingled with water.
<br>23	Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, they run after re- wards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow’s cause cometh not in to them.
<br>24	Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort my- self over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.
<br>25	And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dross, and I will take away all thy tin.
<br>26	And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.
<br>27	Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.
<br>28	And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.
<br>29	For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen. 30 When you shall be as an oak with the leaves
<br>falling off, and as a garden without water.
<br> 
<br>31 And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, con- cerning Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>2	And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.
<br>3	And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
<br>4	And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nei- ther shall they be exercised any more to war.
<br>5	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.
<br>6	For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.
<br>7	Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures.
<br>8	And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.
<br>9	And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.
<br>11	The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
<br>12	Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.
<br>13	And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan.
<br>14	And upon all the high mountains and upon all the elevated hills.
<br>15	And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.
<br>16	And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.
<br>17	And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be hum- bled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
<br>18	And idols shall be utterly destroyed.
<br>19	And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.
<br>20	In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.
<br>21	And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.
<br>22	Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>For behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water.
<br>2	The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet and the cunning man, and the ancient.
<br>3	The captain over fifty, and the honourable in countenance, and the counsellor, and the ar- chitect, and the skilful in eloquent speech.
<br>4	And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them.
<br>5	And the people shall rush one upon another, and every man against his neighbour: the child shall make a tumult against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
<br>6	For a man shall take hold of his brother, one of the house of his father, saying: Thou hast a garment, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.
<br>7	In that day he shall answer, saying: I am no healer, and in my house there is no bread, nor clothing: make me not ruler of the people.
<br>8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty.
<br>9	The shew of their countenance hath an- swered them: and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it: woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to them.
<br>10	Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the fruit of his doings.
<br>11	Woe to the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
<br>12	As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them, and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee blessed, the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps.
<br>13	The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people.
<br>14	The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house.
<br>15	Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts.
<br>16	And the Lord said: Because the daugh- ters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set pace:
<br>17	The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Sion, and the Lord will discover their hair.
<br>18	In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of shoes, and little moons,
<br>19	And chains and necklaces, and bracelets, and bonnets,
<br>20	And bodkins, and ornaments of the legs, and tablets, and sweet balls, and earrings,
<br>21	And rings, and jewels hanging on the fore- head,
<br>22	And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and fine linen, and crisping pins,
<br>23	And lookingglasses, and lawns, and head- bands, and fine veils.
<br>24	And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench, and instead of a girdle, a cord, and instead of curled hair, baldness, and instead of a stomacher, haircloth.
<br>25	Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy valiant ones in battle.
<br>26	And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take away our reproach.
<br>2	In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel.
<br>3	And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem.
<br>4	If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 5 And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion, and where he is called upon, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory
<br>shall be a protection.
<br>6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a security and covert from the whirlwind, and from rain.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My beloved had a vine- yard on a hill in a fruitful place.
<br>2	And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and set up a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
<br>3	And now, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and ye men of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard.
<br>4	What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes?
<br>5	And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted: I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down.
<br>6	And I will make it desolate: it shall not be pruned, and it shall not be digged: but briers and thorns shall come up: and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.
<br>7	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel: and the man of Juda, his pleas- ant plant: and I looked that he should do judg- ment, and behold iniquity: and do justice, and behold a cry.
<br>8	Woe to you that join house to house and lay field to field, even to the end of the place: shall you alone dwell in the midst of the earth?
<br>9	These things are in my ears, saith the Lord of hosts: Unless many great and fair houses shall become desolate, without an inhabitant.
<br>10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure, and thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels.
<br>11	Woe to you that rise up early in the morn- ing to follow drunkenness, and to drink in the evening, to be inflamed with wine.
<br>12	The harp, and the lyre, and, the timbrel and the pipe, and wine are in your feasts: and the work of the Lord you regard not, nor do you consider the works of his hands.
<br>13	Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had not knowledge, and their no- bles have perished with famine, and their multi- tude were dried up with thirst.
<br>14	Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul, and
<br> 
<br>opened her mouth without any bounds, and their strong ones, and their people, and their high and glorious ones shall go down into it.
<br>15	And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low.
<br>16	And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice.
<br>17	And the lambs shall feed according to their order, and strangers shall eat the deserts turned into fruitfulness.
<br>18	Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as the rope of a cart.
<br>19	That say: Let him make haste, and let his work come quickly, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it.
<br>20	Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.
<br>21	Woe to you that are wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your own conceits.
<br>22	Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men at drunkenness.
<br>23	That justify the wicked for gifts, and take away the justice of the just from him.
<br>24	Therefore as the tongue of the fire de- voureth the stubble, and the heat of the flame consumeth it: so shall their root be as ashes, and their bud shall go up as dust: for they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of Israel. 25 Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubles, and their carcasses be- came as dung in the midst of the streets. For after this his anger is not turned away, but his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hand is stretched out still.
<br>26	And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth: and behold they shall come with speed swiftly.
<br>27	There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them: they shall not slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.
<br>28	Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hoofs of their horses shall be like the flint, and their wheels like the violence of a tempest.
<br>29	Their roaring like that of a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea they shall roar, and take hold of the prey, and they shall keep fast hold of it, and there shall be none to deliver it.
<br>30	And they shall make a noise against them that day, like the roaring of the sea; we shall look towards the land, and behold darkness of tribulation, and the light is darkened with the mist thereof.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple.
<br>2	Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they flew.
<br>3	And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory,
<br>4	And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
<br>5	And I said: Woe is me, because I have held
<br> 
<br>my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts.
<br>6	And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar.
<br>7	And he touched my mouth, and said: Be- hold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniq- uities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed.
<br>8	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send?   and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me.
<br>9	And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not.
<br>10	Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them.
<br>11	And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabi- tant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate.
<br>12	And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.
<br>13	And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that Rasin king of Syria and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail over it.
<br>2	And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.
<br>3	And the Lord said to Isaias: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller’s field.
<br>4	And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these firebrands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria, and of the son of Romelia.
<br>5	Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:
<br>6	Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.
<br>7	Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, and this shall not be.
<br>8	But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rasin: and within three- score and five years, Ephraim shall cease to be a people:
<br>9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not continue.
<br>10	And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying: 11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above. 12 And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will
<br>not tempt the Lord.
<br>13	And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?
<br> 
<br>14	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son and his name shall be called Emmanuel.
<br>15	He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good. 16 For before the child know to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two
<br>kings.
<br>17	The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians.
<br>18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the ut- termost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
<br>19	And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.
<br>20	In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard.
<br>21	And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep. 22 And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat
<br>that shall be left in the midst of the land.
<br>23	And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall be- come thorns and briers.
<br>24	With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither: for briers and thorns shall be in all the land.
<br>25	And as for the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, and write in it with a man’s pen. Take away the spoils with speed, quickly take the prey.
<br>2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Urias the priest, and Zacharias the son of Barachias.
<br>3	And I went to the prophetess, and she con- ceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: Make hast to take away the prey.
<br>4	For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of the Assyrians.
<br>5	And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:
<br>6	Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Rasin, and the son of Romelia:
<br>7	Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall overflow all his banks.
<br>8	And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy, land, O Emmanuel.
<br>9	Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome, and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, and be overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome.
<br>10	Take counsel together, and it shall be de- feated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.
<br>11	For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath
<br> 
<br>taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:
<br>12	Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
<br>13	Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
<br>14	And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel, for a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>15	And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken.
<br>16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
<br>17	And I will wait for the Lord, who hath hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
<br>18	Behold I and my children, whom the Lord hath given me for a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Sion.
<br>19	And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their en- chantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?
<br>20	To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning light.
<br>21	And they shall pass by it, they shall fall, and be hungry: and when they shall be hungry, they will be angry, and curse their king, and their God, and look upwards.
<br>22	And they shall look to the earth, and be- hold trouble and darkness, weakness and dis- tress, and a mist following them, and they can- not fly away from their distress.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>At the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded.
<br>2	The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, light is risen.
<br>3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, as con- querors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils.
<br>4	For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou hast overcome, as in the day of Madian.
<br>5	For every violent taking of spoils, with tu- mult, and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire.
<br>6	For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonder- ful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace.
<br>7	His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to es- tablish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
<br>8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
<br>9	And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart:
<br>10	The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them for cedars.
<br>11	And the Lord shall set up the enemies of
<br> 
<br>Rasin over him, and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd:
<br>12	The Syrians from the east, and, the Philistines from the west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his indigna- tion is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<br>13	And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts.
<br>14	And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one day.
<br>15	The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
<br>16	And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down, headlong.
<br>17	Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men: neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. 18 For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the brier and the thorn: and shall kin- dle in the thicket of the forest, and it shall be
<br>wrapped up in smoke ascending on high.
<br>19	By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother.
<br>20	And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry: and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one shall eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda.
<br>21	After all these things his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Woe to them that make wicked laws: and when they write, write injustice:
<br>2	To oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the cause of the humble of my people: that widows might be their prey, and that they might rob the fatherless.
<br>3	What will you do in the day of visitation, and of the calamity which cometh from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
<br>4	That you be not bowed down under the bond, and fall with the slain? In all these things his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<br>5	Woe to the Assyrian, he is the rod and the staff of my anger, and my indignation is in their hands.
<br>6	I will send him to a deceitful nation, and I will give him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take away the spoils, and to lay hold on the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
<br>7	But he shall not take it so, and his heart shall not think so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
<br>8	For he shall say:
<br>9	Are not my princes as so many kings? is not Calano as Charcamis: and Emath as Arphad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
<br>10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idol, so also their idols of Jerusalem, and of Samaria.
<br>11	Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
<br>12	And it shall come to pass, that when the Lord shall have performed all his works in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory
<br> 
<br>of the haughtiness of his eyes.
<br>13	For he hath said: By the strength of my own hand I have done it, and by my own wis- dom I have understood: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have taken the spoils of the princes, and as a mighty man hath pulled down them that sat on high.
<br>14	And my hand hath found the strength of the people as a nest; and as eggs are gathered, that are left, so have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or made the least noise.
<br>15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it? or shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn? as if a rod should lift itself up against him that lifteth it up, and a staff exalt itself, which is but wood.
<br>16	Therefore the sovereign Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones: and under his glory shall be kindled a burning, as it were the burning of a fire.
<br>17	And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and the Holy One thereof as a flame: and his thorns and his briers shall be set on fire, and shall be devoured in one day.
<br>18	And the glory of his forest, and of his beau- tiful hill, shall be consumed from the soul even to the flesh, and he shall run away through fear. 19 And they that remain of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that they shall easily be
<br>numbered, and a child shall write them down.
<br>20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that shall escape of the house of Jacob, shall lean no more upon him that striketh them: but they shall lean upon the Lord the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
<br>21	The remnant shall be converted, the rem- nant, I say, of Jacob, to the mighty God.
<br>22	For if thy people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be con-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>verted, the consumption abridged shall overflow with justice.
<br>23	For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, and an abridgment in the midst of all the land.
<br>24	Therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of hosts: O my people that dwellest in Sion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall strike thee with his rod, and he shall lift up his staff over thee in the way of Egypt.
<br>25	For yet a little and a very little while, and my indignation shall cease, and my wrath shall be upon their wickedness.
<br>26	And the Lord of hosts shall raise up a scourge against him, according to the slaugh- ter of Madian in the rock of Oreb, and his rod over the sea, and he shall lift it up in the way of Egypt.
<br>27	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall putrefy at the presence of the oil.
<br>28	He shall come into Aiath, he shall pass into Magron: at Machmas he shall lay up his car- riages.
<br>29	They have passed in haste, Gaba is our lodging: Rama was astonished, Gabaath of Saul fled away.
<br>30	Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim, attend, O Laisa, poor Anathoth.
<br>31	Medemena is removed: ye inhabitants of Gabim, take courage.
<br>32	It is yet day enough, to remain in Nobe: he shall shake his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Sion, the hill of Jerusalem.
<br>33	Behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall break the earthen vessel with terror, and the tall of stature shall be cut down, and the lofty shall be humbled.
<br>34	And the thickets of the forest shall be cut
<br> 
<br>down with iron, and Libanus with its high ones shall fall.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of his root. 2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: the spirit of wisdom, and of understanding, the spirit of counsel, and of fortitude, the spirit
<br>of knowledge, and of godliness.
<br>3	And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord, He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes, nor reprove according to the hearing of the ears.
<br>4	But he shall judge the poor with justice, and shall reprove with equity the meek of the earth: and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.
<br>5	And justice shall be the girdle of his loins: and faith the girdle of his reins.
<br>6	The wolf shall dwell with the lamb: and the leopard shall lie down with the kid: the calf and the lion, and the sheep shall abide together, and a little child shall lead them.
<br>7	The calf and the bear shall feed: their young ones shall rest together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
<br>8	And the sucking child shall play on other hole of the asp: and the weaned child shall thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk.
<br>9	They shall not hurt, nor shall they kill in all my holy mountain, for the earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the covering waters of the sea.
<br>10	In that day the root of Jesse, who standeth for an ensign of the people, him the Gentiles shall beseech, and his sepulchre shall be glorious.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand the second time to possess the remnant of his people, which shall be left from the Assyrians, and from Egypt, and from Phetros, and from Ethiopia, and from Elam, and from Sennaar, and from Emath, and from the islands of the sea.
<br>12	And he shall set up a standard unto the nations, and shall assemble the fugitives of Israel, and shall gather together the dispersed of Juda from the four quarters of the earth.
<br>13	And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, and Juda shall not fight against Ephraim.
<br>14	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines by the sea, they together shall spoil the children of the east: Edom, till Moab shall be under the rule of their hand, and the children of Ammon shall be obedient.
<br>15	And the Lord shall lay waste the tongue of the sea of Egypt, and shall lift up his hand over the river in the strength of his spirit: and he shall strike it in the seven streams, so that men may pass through it in their shoes.
<br>16	And there shall be a highway for the rem- nant of my people, which shall be left from the Assyrians: as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And thou shalt say in that day: I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: thy wrath is turned away, and thou hast com- forted me.
<br>2 Behold, God is my saviour, I will deal con- fidently, and will not fear: because the Lord is my strength, and my praise, and he is become
<br> 
<br>my salvation.
<br>3	Thou shall draw waters with joy out of the saviour’s fountains:
<br>4	And you shall say in that day: Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make his works known among the people: remember that his name is high.
<br>5	Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath done great things: shew this forth in all the earth.
<br>6	Rejoice, and praise, O thou habitation of Sion: for great is he that is in the midst of thee, the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>The burden of Babylon which Isaias the son of Amos saw.
<br>2	Upon the dark mountain lift ye up a ban- ner, exalt the voice, lift up the hand, and let the rulers go into the gates.
<br>3	I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong ones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory.
<br>4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as it were of many people, the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war. 5 To them that come from a country afar off, from the end of heaven: the Lord and the instru-
<br>ments of his wrath, to destroy the whole land.
<br>6	Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near: it shall come as a destruction from the Lord.
<br>7	Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every heart of man shall melt,
<br>8	And shall be broken. Gripings and pains, shall take hold of them, they shall be in pain as a woman in labour. Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour, their countenances shall be as faces burnt.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
<br>10	For the stars of heaven, and their bright- ness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light.
<br>11	And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.
<br>12	A man shall be more precious than gold, yea a man than the finest of gold.
<br>13	For this I will trouble the heaven: and the earth shall be moved out of her place, for the indignation of the Lord of hosts, and for the day of his fierce wrath.
<br>14	And they shall be as a doe fleeing away, and as a sheep: and there shall be none to gather them together: every man shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
<br>15	Every one that shall be found, shall be slain: and every one that shall come to their aid, shall fall by the sword.
<br>16	Their inhabitants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes: their houses shall be pillaged, and their wives shall be ravished.
<br>17	Behold I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not seek silver, nor desire gold: 18 But with their arrows they shall kill the children, and shall have no pity upon the suck- lings of the womb, and their eye shall not spare
<br>their sons.
<br>19	And that Babylon, glorious among king- doms, the famous pride of the Chaldeans, shall be even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gom- orrha.
<br>20	It shall no more be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be founded unto generation and gen-
<br> 
<br>eration: neither shall the Arabian pitch his tents there, nor shall shepherds rest there.
<br>21	But wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be filled with serpents, and ostriches shall dwell there, and the hairy ones shall dance there:
<br>22	And owls shall answer one another there, in the houses thereof, and sirens in the temples of pleasure.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Her time is near at hand, and her days shall not be prolonged. For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose out of Israel, and will make them rest upon their own ground: and the stranger shall be joined with them, and shall ad- here to the house of Jacob.
<br>2	And the people shall take them, and bring them into their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids: and they shall make them captives that had taken them, and shall subdue their oppressors.
<br>3	And it shall come to pass in that day, that when God shall give thee rest from thy labour, and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage, wherewith thou didst serve be- fore,
<br>4	Thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and shalt say:   How is the oppressor come to nothing, the tribute hath ceased?
<br>5	The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers,
<br>6	That struck the people in wrath with an incurable wound, that brought nations under in fury, that persecuted in a cruel manner.
<br>7	The whole earth is quiet and still, it is glad
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and hath rejoiced.
<br>8	The fir trees also have rejoiced over thee, and the cedars of Libanus, saying: Since thou hast slept, there hath none come up to cut us down.
<br>9	Hell below was in an uproar to meet thee at thy coming, it stirred up the giants for thee. All the princes of the earth are risen up from their thrones, all the princes of nations.
<br>10	All shall answer, and say to thee: Thou also art wounded as well as we, thou art become like unto us.
<br>11	Thy pride is brought down to hell, thy car- cass is fallen down: under thee shall the moth be strewed, and worms shall be thy covering.
<br>12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning? how art thou fallen to the earth, that didst wound the nations? 13 And thou saidst in thy heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will sit in the mountain of the
<br>covenant, in the sides of the north.
<br>14	I will ascend above the height of the clouds, I will be like the most High.
<br>15	But yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, into the depth of the pit.
<br>16	They that shall see thee, shall turn toward thee, and behold thee. Is this the man that trou- bled the earth, that shook kingdoms,
<br>17	That made the world a wilderness, and de- stroyed the cities thereof, that opened not the prison to his prisoners?
<br>18	All the kings of the nations have all of them slept in glory, every one in his own house.
<br>19	But thou art cast out of thy grave, as an unprofitable branch defiled, and wrapped up among them that were slain by the sword, and art gone down to the bottom of the pit, as a rotten carcass.
<br> 
<br>20	Thou shalt not keep company with them, even in burial: for thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people: the seed of the wicked shall not be named for ever.
<br>21	Prepare his children for slaughter for the iniquity of their fathers: they shall not rise up, nor inherit the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
<br>22	And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will destroy the name of Babylon, and the remains, and the bud, and the offspring, saith the Lord.
<br>23	And I will make it a possession for the eri- cius and pools of waters, and I will sweep it and wear it out with a besom, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>24	The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have thought, so shall it be: and as I have purposed,
<br>25	So shall it fall out: That I will destroy the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: and his yoke shall be taken away from them, and his burden shall be taken off their shoulder.
<br>26	This is the counsel, that I have purposed upon all the earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.
<br>27	For the Lord of hosts hath decreed, and who can disannul it? and his hand is stretched out: and who shall turn it away?
<br>28	In the year that king Achaz died, was this burden:
<br>29	Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia, that the rod of him that struck thee is broken in pieces: for out of the root of the serpent shall come forth a basilisk, and his seed shall swallow the bird.
<br>30	And the firstborn of the poor shall be fed, and the poor shall rest with confidence: and I will make thy root perish with famine, and I will kill thy remnant.
<br>31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city: all Philistia is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thrown down: for a smoke shall come from the north, and there is none that shall escape his troop.
<br>32	And what shall be answered to the messen- gers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded Sion, and the poor of his people shall hope in him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, it is silent: because the wall of Moab is destroyed in the night, it is silent.
<br>2	The house is gone up, and Dibon to the high places to mourn over Nabo, and over Medaba, Moab hath howled: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard shall be shaven.
<br>3	In their streets they are girded with sack- cloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets all shall howl and come down weeping.
<br>4	Hesebon shall cry, and Eleale, their voice is heard even to Jasa. For this shall the well appointed men of Moab howl, his soul shall howl to itself.
<br>5	My heart shall cry to Moab, the bars thereof shall flee unto Segor a heifer of three years old: for by the ascent of Luith they shall go up weep- ing: and in the way of Oronaim they shall lift up a cry of destruction.
<br>6	For the waters of Nemrim shall be deso- late, for the grass is withered away, the spring is faded, all the greenness is perished.
<br>7	According to the greatness of their work, is their visitation also: they shall lead them to the torrent of the willows.
<br>8	For the cry is gone round about the border of Moab: the howling thereof unto Gallim, and unto the well of Elim the cry thereof.
<br>9	For the waters of Dibon are filled with blood:
<br> 
<br>for I will bring more upon Dibon: the lion upon them that shall flee of Moab, and upon the rem- nant of the land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>Send forth, O Lord, the lamb, the ruler of the earth, from Petra of the desert, to the mount of the daughter of Sion.
<br>2	And it shall come to pass, that as a bird fleeing away, and as young ones flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be in the passage of Arnon.
<br>3	Take counsel, gather a council: make thy shadow as the night in the midday: hide them that flee, and betray not them that wander about.
<br>4	My fugitives shall dwell with thee: O Moab, be thou a covert to them from the face of the destroyer: for the dust is at an end, the wretch is consumed: he hath failed, that trod the earth under foot.
<br>5	And a throne shall be prepared in mercy, and one shall sit upon it in truth in the taberna- cle of David, judging and seeking judgment and quickly rendering that which is just.
<br>6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his pride and his arrogancy, and his indignation is more than his strength.
<br>7	Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab, every one shall howl: to them that rejoice upon the brick walls, tell ye their stripes.
<br>8	For the suburbs of Hesebon are desolate, and the lords of the nations have destroyed the vineyard of Sabama: the branches thereof have reached even to Jazer: they have wandered in the wilderness, the branches thereof are left, they are gone over the sea.
<br>9	Therefore I will lament with the weeping of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Jazer the vineyard of Sabama: I will water thee with my tears, O Hesebon, and Eleale: for the voice of the treaders hath rushed in upon thy vintage, and upon thy harvest.
<br>10	And gladness and joy shall be taken away from Carmel, and there shall be no rejoicing nor shouting in the vineyards. He shall not tread out wine in the press that was wont to tread it out: the voice of the treaders I have taken away.
<br>11	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for the brick wall.
<br>12	And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is wearied on his high places, that he shall go in to his sanctuaries to pray, and shall not prevail.
<br>13	This is the word, that the Lord spoke to Moab from that time:
<br>14	And now the Lord hath spoken, saying: In three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be taken away for all the multitude of the people, and it shall be left small and feeble, not many.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>The burden of Damascus. Behold Damascus shall cease to be a city, and shall be as a ruinous heap of stones.
<br>2	The cities of Aroer shall be left for flocks, and they shall rest there, and there shall be none to make them afraid.
<br>3	And aid shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus: and the remnant of Syria shall be as the glory of the children of Is- rael: saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall grow lean.
<br> 
<br>5	And it shall be as when one gathereth in the harvest that which remaineth, and his arm shall gather the ears of corn: and it shall be as he that seeketh ears in the vale of Raphaim.
<br>6	And the fruit thereof that shall be left upon it, shall be as one cluster of grapes, and as the shaking of the olive tree, two or three berries in the top of a bough, or four or five upon the top of the tree, saith the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>7	In that day man shall bow down himself to his Maker, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.
<br>8	And he shall not look to the altars which his hands made; and he shall not have respect to the things that his fingers wrought, such as groves and temples.
<br>9	In that day his strong cities shall be for- saken, as the ploughs, and the corn that were left before the face of the children of Israel, and thou shalt be desolate.
<br>10	Because thou hast forgotten God thy saviour, and hast not remembered thy strong helper: therefore shalt thou plant good plants, and shalt sow strange seed.
<br>11	In the day of thy planting shall be the wild grape, and in the morning thy seed shall flourish: the harvest is taken away in the day of inheri- tance, and shall grieve thee much.
<br>12	Woe to the multitude of many people, like the multitude of the roaring sea: and the tumult of crowds, like the noise of many waters.
<br>13	Nations shall make a noise like the noise of waters overflowing, but he shall rebuke him, and he shall flee far off: and he shall be carried away as the dust of the mountains before the wind, and as a whirlwind before a tempest.
<br>14	In the time of the evening, behold there shall be trouble: the morning shall come, and he shall not be: this is the portion of them that have wasted us, and the lot of them that spoiled
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>us.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>
<br>Woe to the land, the winged cymbal, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,
<br>2	That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, and in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters. Go, ye swift angels, to a nation rent and torn in pieces: to a terrible people, after which there is no other: to a nation expecting and trodden underfoot, whose land the rivers have spoiled.
<br>3	All ye inhabitants of the world, who dwell on the earth, when the sign shall be lifted up on the mountains, you shall see, and you shall hear the sound of the trumpet.
<br>4	For thus saith the Lord to me: I will take my rest, and consider in my place, as the noon light is clear, and as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest.
<br>5	For before the harvest it was all flourishing, and it shall bud without perfect ripeness, and the sprigs thereof shall be cut off with pruning hooks: and what is left shall be cut away and shaken out.
<br>6	And they shall be left together to the birds of the mountains, and the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall be upon them all the summer, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
<br>7	At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts, from a people rent and torn in pieces: from a terrible people, after which there hath been no other: from a nation expecting, expecting and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, to mount Sion.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 19
<br>The burden of Egypt. Behold the Lord will ascend upon a swift cloud, and will enter into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof.
<br>2	And I will set the Egyptians to fight against the Egyptians: and they shall fight brother against brother, and friend against friend, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
<br>3	And the spirit of Egypt shall be broken in the bowels thereof, and I will cast down their counsel: and they shall consult their idols, and their diviners, and their wizards, and soothsay- ers.
<br>4	And I will deliver Egypt into the hand of cruel masters, and a strong king shall rule over them, saith the Lord the God of hosts.
<br>5	And the water of the sea shall be dried up, and the river shall be wasted and dry.
<br>6	And the rivers shall fail: the streams of the banks shall be diminished, and be dried up. The reed and the bulrush shall wither away.
<br>7	The channel of the river shall be laid bare from its fountain, and every thing sown by the water shall be dried up, it shall wither away, and shall be no more.
<br>8	The fishers also shall mourn, and all that cast a hook into the river shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish away.
<br>9	They shall be confounded that wrought in flax, combing and weaving fine linen.
<br>10	And its watery places shall be dry, all they shall mourn that made pools to take fishes.
<br>11	The princes of Tanis are become fools, the wise counsellors of Pharao have given foolish counsel: how will you say to Pharao: I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Where are now thy wise men? let them tell thee, and shew what the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
<br>13	The princes of Tanis are become fools, the princes of Memphis are gone astray, they have deceived Egypt, the stay of the people thereof.
<br>14	The Lord hath mingled in the midst thereof the spirit of giddiness: and they have caused Egypt to err in all its works, as a drunken man staggereth and vomiteth.
<br>15	And there shall be no work for Egypt, to make head or tail, him that bendeth down, or that holdeth back.
<br>16	In that day Egypt shall be like unto women, and they shall be amazed, and afraid, because of the moving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall move over it.
<br>17	And the land of Juda shall be a terror to Egypt: everyone that shall remember it shall tremble because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath determined concerning it.
<br>18	In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt, speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts: one shall be called the city of the sun.
<br>19	In that day there shall be an altar of the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a monument of the Lord at the borders thereof:
<br>20	It shall be for a sign, and for a testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry to the Lord because of the oppressor, and he shall send them a Saviour and a defender to deliver them.
<br>21	And the Lord shall be known by Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall worship him with sacrifices and offerings: and they shall make vows to the Lord, and perform them.
<br>22	And the Lord shall strike Egypt with a scourge, and shall heal it, and they shall return
<br> 
<br>to the Lord, and he shall be pacified towards them, and heal them.
<br>23	In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrian shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptian to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrian.
<br>24	In that day shall Israel be the third to the Egyptian and the Assyrian: a blessing in the midst of the land,
<br>25	Which the Lord of hosts hath blessed, say- ing: Blessed be my people of Egypt, and the work of my hands to the Assyrian: but Israel is my inheritance.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>In the year that Tharthan entered into Azotus, when Sargon the king of the Assyrians had sent him, and he had fought against Azotus, and had taken it:
<br>2	At that same time the Lord spoke by the hand of Isaias the son of Amos, saying Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and take off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, and went naked, and barefoot.
<br>3	And the Lord said: As my servant Isaias hath walked, naked and barefoot, it shall be a sign and a wonder of three years upon Egypt, and upon Ethiopia,
