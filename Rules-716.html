<br>§717y. Voluntary conversion of natural gas users to heavy fuel oil
<br>(a) Transfer of contractual interests
<br>
<br>(1) In order to facilitate voluntary conversion of facilities from the use of natural gas to the use of heavy petroleum fuel oil, the Commission shall, by rule, provide a procedure for the approval by the Commission of any transfer to any person described in paragraph 2(B)(i), (ii), or (iii) of contractual interests involving the receipt of natural gas described in paragraph 2(A).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The rule required under paragraph (1) shall apply to—
<br>
<br>(i) natural gas—
<br>
<br>(I) received by the user pursuant to a contract entered into before September 1, 1977, not including any renewal or extension thereof entered into on or after such date other than any such extension or renewal pursuant to the exercise by such user of an option to extend or renew such contract;
<br>
<br>(II) other than natural gas the sale for resale or the transportation of which was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] as of September 1, 1977;
<br>
<br>(III) which was used as a fuel in any facility in existence on September 1, 1977.
<br>
<br>(ii) natural gas subject to a prohibition order issued under section 717z of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) The rule required under paragraph (1) shall permit the transfer of contractual interests—
<br>
<br>(i) to any interstate pipeline;
<br>
<br>(ii) to any local distribution company served by an interstate pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(iii) to any person served by an interstate pipeline for a high priority use by such person.
<br>
<br>(3) The rule required under paragraph (1) shall provide that any transfer of contractual interests pursuant to such rule shall be under such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe. Such rule shall include a requirement for refund of any consideration, received by the person transferring contractual interests pursuant to such rule, to the extent such consideration exceeds the amount by which the costs actually incurred, during the remainder of the period of the contract with respect to which such contractual interests are transferred, in direct association with the use of heavy petroleum fuel oil as a fuel in the applicable facility exceeds the price under such contract for natural gas, subject to such contract, delivered during such period.
<br>
<br>(4) In prescribing the rule required under paragraph (1), and in determining whether to approve any transfer of contractual interests, the Commission shall consider whether such transfer of contractual interests is likely to increase demand for imported refined petroleum products.
<br>(b) Commission approval
<br>
<br>(1) No transfer of contractual interests authorized by the rule required under subsection (a)(1) may take effect unless the Commission issues a certificate of public convenience and necessity for such transfer if such natural gas is to be resold by the person to whom such contractual interests are to be transferred. Such certificate shall be issued by the Commission in accordance with the requirements of this subsection and those of section 7 of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717f], and the provisions of such Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] applicable to the determination of satisfaction of the public convenience and necessity requirements of such section.
<br>
<br>(2) The rule required under subsection (a)(1) shall set forth guidelines for the application on a regional or national basis (as the Commission determines appropriate) of the criteria specified in subsection (e)(2) and (3) to determine the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.
<br>(c) Restrictions on transfers unenforceable
<br>
<br>Any provision of any contract, which provision prohibits any transfer of any contractual interests thereunder, or any commingling or transportation of natural gas subject to such contract with natural gas the sale for resale or transportation of which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.], or terminates such contract on the basis of any such transfer, commingling, or transportation, shall be unenforceable in any court of the United States and in any court of any State if applied with respect to any transfer approved under the rule required under subsection (a)(1).
<br>(d) Contractual obligations unaffected
<br>
<br>The person acquiring contractual interests transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1) shall assume the contractual obligations which the person transferring such contractual interests has under such contract. This section shall not relieve the person transferring such contractual interests from any contractual obligation of such person under such contract if such obligation is not performed by the person acquiring such contractual interests.
<br>(e) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) the price under such contract for natural gas, subject to such contract, delivered during such period.
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reasonable costs directly associated with the use of heavy petroleum fuel oil as a fuel shall include an allowance for the amortization, over the remaining useful life, of the undepreciated value of depreciable assets located on the premises containing such facility, which assets were directly associated with the use of natural gas and are not usable in connection with the use of such heavy petroleum fuel oil.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "just compensation", when used with respect to any intrastate pipeline which would have transported or distributed natural gas with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), means an amount equal to any loss of revenue, during the remaining period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), to the extent such loss—
<br>
<br>(A) is directly incurred by reason of the discontinuation of the transportation or distribution of natural gas resulting from the transfer of contractual interests pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1); and
<br>
<br>(B) is not offset by—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction in expenses associated with such discontinuation; and

<br>(7) The term "heavy petroleum fuel oil" means number 4, 5, or 6 fuel oil which is domestically refined.
<br>
<br>(8) The term "local distribution company" means any person, other than any intrastate pipeline or any interstate pipeline, engaged in the transportation, or local distribution, of natural gas and the sale of natural gas for ultimate consumption.
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) No person shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] as a natural gas-company (within the meaning of such Act) or to regulation as a common carrier under any provision of Federal or State law solely by reason of making any sale, or engaging in any transportation, of natural gas with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1).
<br>
<br>(3) Nothing in this section shall exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] any transportation in interstate commerce of natural gas, any sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas, or any person engaged in such transportation or such sale to the extent such transportation, sale, or person is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under such Act without regard to the transfer of contractual interests pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1).
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this section shall exempt any person from any obligation to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the sale in interstate commerce for resale or the transportation in interstate commerce of natural gas with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1).
<br>(g) Volume limitation
<br>
<br>No supplier of natural gas under any contract, with respect to which contractual interests have been transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), shall be required to supply natural gas during any relevant period in volume amounts which exceed the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(1) the volume determined by reference to the maximum delivery obligations specified in such contract;
<br>
<br>(2) the volume which such supplier would have been required to supply, under the curtailment plan in effect for such supplier, to the person, who transferred contractual interests pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), if no such transfer had occurred; and
<br>
<br>(3) the volume actually delivered or for which payment would have been made pursuant to such contract during the 12-calendar-month period ending immediately before such transfer of contractual interests.

<br>§719a. Congressional statement of purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this chapter is to provide the means for making a sound decision as to the selection of a transportation system for delivery of Alaska natural gas to the contiguous States for construction and initial operation by providing for the participation of the President and the Congress in the selection process, and, if such a system is approved under this chapter, to expedite its construction and initial operation by (1) limiting the jurisdiction of the courts to review the actions of Federal officers or agencies taken pursuant to the direction and authority of this chapter, and (2) permitting the limitation of administrative procedures and effecting the limitation of judicial procedures related to such actions. To accomplish this purpose it is the intent of the Congress to exercise its constitutional powers to the fullest extent in the authorizations and directions herein made, and particularly with respect to the limitation of judicial review of actions of Federal officers or agencies taken pursuant thereto.

<br>Part II. Other Provisions
<br>Sec. 201. Executive Policy Board
<br>
<br>The Executive Policy Board for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System, hereinafter the "Executive Policy Board", which shall be established by executive order, shall advise the Federal Inspector on the performance of the Inspector's functions. All other functions assigned, or which could be assigned pursuant to the Decision, to the Executive Policy Board are hereby transferred to the Federal Inspector.
<br>Sec. 202. Federal Inspector and Agency Authorized Officers
<br>
<br>(a) The Agency Authorized Officers shall be detailed to and located within the Office. The Federal Inspector shall delegate to each Agency Authorized Officer the authority to enforce the terms, conditions, and stipulations of each grant, permit, or other authorization issued by the Federal agency which appointed the Agency Authorized Officer. In the exercise of these enforcement functions, the Agency Authorized Officers shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Federal Inspector, whose decision on enforcement matters shall constitute "action" for purposes of Section 10 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 719h).
<br>
<br>(b) The Federal Inspector shall be responsible for coordinating the expeditious discharge of nonenforcement activities by Federal agencies and coordinating the compliance by all the Federal agencies with Section 9 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 719g). Such coordination shall include requiring submission of scheduling plans for all permits, certificates, grants or other necessary authorizations, and coordinating scheduling of system-related agency activities. Such coordination may include serving as the "one window" point for filing for and issuance of all necessary permits, certificates, grants or other authorizations, and, consistent with law, Federal government requests for data or information related to any application for a permit, certificate, grant or other authorization. Upon agreement between the Federal Inspector and the head of any agency, that agency may delegate to the Federal Inspector any statutory function vested in such agency related to the functions of the Federal Inspector.
<br>
<br>(c) The Federal Inspector and Agency Authorized Officers in implementing the enforcement authorities herein transferred shall carry out the enforcement policies and procedures established by the Federal agencies which nominally administer these authorities, except where the Federal Inspector determines that such policies and procedures would require action inconsistent with Section 9 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 719g).
<br>
<br>(d) Under the authority of Section 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 719m), the Federal Inspector will undertake to obtain appropriations for all aspects of the Federal Inspector's operations. Such undertaking shall include appropriations for all of the functions specified in the Act and in the general terms and conditions of the Decision as well as for the enforcement activities of the Federal Inspector. The Federal Inspector will consult with the various Federal agencies as to resource requirements for enforcing their respective permits and other authorizations in preparing a unified budget for the Office. The budget shall be reviewed by the Executive Policy Board.

<br>So much of the personnel, property, records and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations and other funds employed, used, held, available, or to be made available in connection with the functions transferred under this Plan, as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall determine, shall be transferred to the appropriate agency or component at such time or times as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide, except that no such unexpended balances transferred shall be used for purposes other than those for which the appropriation was originally made. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide for the terminating of the affairs of the Office and the Federal Inspector upon their abolition pursuant to this Plan and for such further measures and dispositions as such Director deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Plan.
<br>Sec. 205. Effective Date
<br>
<br>This Plan shall become effective at such time or times as the President shall specify, but not sooner than the earliest time allowable under Section 906 of Title 5 of the United States Code, except that the provisions of Section 203 shall occur as provided by the terms of that Section.
<br>
<br>[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. No. 12142, June 21, 1979, 44 F.R. 36927, this Reorg. Plan is effective July 1, 1979].
<br>
<br>[For abolition of Office of the Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System and transfer of functions and authority, see section 3012(b) of Pub. L. 102–486, set out as an Abolition of Office of Federal Inspector note above.]
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I am submitting to you today Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979 to create the Office of Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System and establish the position of Federal Inspector. Creation of this Office and the transfer of appropriate Federal enforcement authority and responsibility is consistent with my September 1977 Decision and Report to the Congress on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System. This decision was approved by the Congress November 2, 1977.
<br>
<br>The Alaska Gas Transportation System is a 4,748-mile pipeline to be constructed in partnership with Canada. Canada completed legislation enacting a similar transfer last year and has already appointed an official to coordinate its activities prior to and during pipeline construction. The Northwest Alaska Pipeline Company has been selected to construct the pipeline, with completion scheduled in late 1984. Estimated construction costs are $10–$15 billion, to be financed by private investment.
<br>
<br>Natural gas is among the Nation's most valuable fuels. It is in the national interest to bring Alaskan gas reserves to market at the lowest possible price for consumers. Construction of a gas pipeline from the Prudhoe Bay reserves in Alaska through Canada to points in the West and Midwest United States will provide a system which will deliver more Alaskan natural gas at less cost to a greater number of Americans than any alternative transportation system. Every effort must be made to ensure timely completion of the pipeline at the lowest possible cost consistent with Federal regulatory policies.
<br>
<br>As a result of our experience in construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, we recognize the need for the Federal Government to be in a strong position to manage its own role in this project through prompt, coordinated decisionmaking in pre-construction approval functions and in enforcing the terms and conditions of the permits, certificates, leases, and other authorizations to be issued by various Federal agencies. We must avoid duplicating the delays and cost escalations experienced in the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The Plan I am submitting would establish clear responsibility for the efficient functioning of Federal enforcement activities by assigning the Federal Inspector authority to carry out these responsibilities.
<br>
<br>The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 [15 U.S.C. 719 et seq.] only provided for monitoring the construction of the pipeline. The Plan transfers to the Federal Inspector the authority to supervise the enforcement of terms and conditions of the permits and other authorizations, including those to be issued by the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, and Treasury, and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Plan provides for the Federal Inspector to coordinate other Federal activities directly related to the pipeline project. Federal agencies retain their authority to issue permits and related authorizations, but enforcement of the terms and conditions of these authorizations is transferred to the Federal Inspector. Transfer of enforcement authority from Federal agencies to the Federal Inspector is limited in scope to their participation in this project and in duration to the pre-construction, construction, and initial operation phases of the project.
<br>
<br>The Decision and Report to the Congress recommended an Executive Policy Board with policy-making and supervisory authority over the Federal Inspector. I plan to sign an Executive Order upon approval of this Plan by the Congress which will create an Executive Policy Board which will be only advisory, but which will enhance communication and coordinate among Federal agencies and with the Federal Inspector. The Plan modifies the Decision and Report in that regard. The Federal Inspector will use the policies and procedures of the agencies involved in exercising the transferred enforcement responsibilities to the maximum extent practicable. The Board provides the opportunity for agencies to contribute to the policy deliberations of the Inspector and exercises an oversight role to insure that pipeline activities are carried on within existing regulatory policy. The Board is required to review the budget of the Office of the Federal Inspector and periodically report to me on the progress of construction and on major problems encountered. I am convinced that the Federal Inspector must have authority commensurate with his responsibilities.
<br>
<br>Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. The appointment and compensation of the Federal Inspector is in accordance with the provisions of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 [15 U.S.C. 719 et seq.], and the Reorganization Act of 1977. The provisions for appointment and pay in this Plan are necessary by reason of a reorganization made by the Plan. The rate of compensation is comparable to rates for similar positions within the Executive Branch. This reorganization will result in a reduction in the cost of construction for the pipeline system and ultimately in savings to American consumers. A small increase in cost to the Federal government will result from the creation of the Office of the Federal Inspector. The Plan requires that the Office and the position of Federal Inspector will be abolished upon the first anniversary date after the pipeline becomes operational.

A copy of each statement shall be forwarded promptly to the Board and made available to the public by the Federal Inspector.
<br>
<br>1–107. After written notice of a proposed enforcement action is given by the Federal Inspector, the Federal Inspector will be subject to the rules of procedure for ex parte contacts as reflected in the guidelines and policies of Departments and Agencies from which the specific enforcement authority is transferred.
<br>
<br>1–108. The Federal Inspector and all employees of the Office of the Federal Inspector shall be subject to the provisions of Executive Order No. 11222 concerning standards of conduct for Federal employees. The Federal Inspector shall issue standards of conduct, pursuant to the Order, for the Office of the Federal Inspector.
<br>
<br>1–109. To the extent permitted by law, each Department and Agency shall cooperate with and furnish necessary information and assistance to the Board in the performance of its functions.

<br>In considering an application under this section, the Commission shall presume that—
<br>
<br>(A) a public need exists to construct and operate the proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project; and
<br>
<br>(B) sufficient downstream capacity will exist to transport the Alaska natural gas moving through the project to markets in the contiguous United States.
<br>(c) Expedited approval process
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after the date of issuance of the final environmental impact statement under section 720b of this title for an Alaska natural gas transportation project, the Commission shall issue a final order granting or denying any application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the project under section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717f(c)) and this section.
<br>(d) Prohibition of certain pipeline route
<br>
<br>No license, permit, lease, right-of-way, authorization, or other approval required under Federal law for the construction of any pipeline to transport natural gas from land within the Prudhoe Bay oil and gas lease area may be granted for any pipeline that follows a route that—
<br>
<br>(1) traverses land beneath navigable waters (as defined in section 1301 of title 43) beneath, or the adjacent shoreline of, the Beaufort Sea; and
