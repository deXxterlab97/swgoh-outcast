<br>§2656a. Congressional declaration of findings of major significance of modern scientific and technological advances in foreign policy
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the consequences of modern scientific and technological advances are of such major significance in United States foreign policy that understanding and appropriate knowledge of modern science and technology by officers and employees of the United States Government are essential in the conduct of modern diplomacy;
<br>
<br>(2) many problems and opportunities for development in modern diplomacy lie in scientific and technological fields;
<br>
<br>(3) in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the technological aspects of United States foreign policy, the United States Government should seek out and consult with both public and private industrial, academic, and research institutions concerned with modern technology; and
<br>
<br>(4) the effective use of science and technology in international relations for the mutual benefit of all countries requires the development and use of the skills and methods of long-range planning.

<br>§2656b. Congressional declaration of policy regarding consequences of science and technology on conduct of foreign policy
<br>
<br>In order to maximize the benefits and to minimize the adverse consequences of science and technology in the conduct of foreign policy, the Congress declares the following to be the policy of the United States:
<br>
<br>(1) Technological opportunities, impacts, changes, and threats should be anticipated and assessed, and appropriate measures should be implemented to influence such technological developments in ways beneficial to the United States and other countries.
<br>
<br>(2) The mutually beneficial applications of technology in bilateral and multilateral agreements and activities involving the United States and foreign countries or international organizations should be recognized and supported as an important element of United States foreign policy.
<br>
<br>(3) The United States Government should implement appropriate measures to insure that individuals are trained in the use of science and technology as an instrument in international relations and that officers and employees of the United States Government engaged in formal and informal exchanges of scientific and technical information, personnel, and hardware are knowledgeable in international affairs.
<br>
<br>(4) In recognition of the environmental and technological factors that change relations among countries and in recognition of the growing interdependence between the domestic and foreign policies and programs of the United States, United States foreign policy should be continually reviewed by the executive and legislative branches of the Government to insure appropriate and timely application of science and technology to the conduct of United States foreign policy.
<br>
<br>(5) Federally supported international science and technology agreements should be negotiated to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) intellectual property rights are properly protected; and
<br>
<br>(B) access to research and development opportunities and facilities, and the flow of scientific and technological information, are, to the maximum extent practicable, equitable and reciprocal.

<br>"(a) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) no international regime governs the use of nuclear-powered satellites in space;
<br>
<br>"(2) the unregulated use of such technology poses the possibility of catastrophic damage to human life and the global environment; and

<br>
<br>"(b) It is therefore the sense of the Congress that the United States should take the initiative immediately in seeking a multilateral agreement governing the use of nuclear-powered satellites in space.

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Complex terrorist operations require locations that provide such operations sanctuary from interference by Government or law enforcement personnel.
<br>
<br>"(2) A terrorist sanctuary existed in Afghanistan before September 11, 2001.
<br>
<br>"(3) The terrorist sanctuary in Afghanistan provided direct and indirect value to members of al Qaeda who participated in the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and in other terrorist operations.
<br>
<br>"(4) Terrorist organizations have fled to some of the least governed and most lawless places in the world to find sanctuary.
<br>
<br>"(5) During the 21st century, terrorists are often focusing on remote regions and failing states as locations to seek sanctuary.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress on United States Policy on Terrorist Sanctuaries.—It is the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to identify foreign countries that are being used as terrorist sanctuaries;
<br>
<br>"(2) to assess current United States resources and tools being used to assist foreign governments to eliminate such sanctuaries;
<br>
<br>"(3) to develop and implement a coordinated strategy to prevent terrorists from using such foreign countries as sanctuaries; and
<br>
<br>"(4) to work in bilateral and multilateral fora to elicit the cooperation needed to identify and address terrorist sanctuaries that may exist today, but, so far, remain unknown to governments."
