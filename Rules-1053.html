<br>For a local educational agency that is eligible under section 7345(b)(1)(C) of this title and is a member of an educational service agency, the Secretary may determine the award amount by subtracting from the initial amount determined under paragraph (2), an amount that is equal to that local educational agency's per-pupil share of the total amount received by the educational service agency under the provisions described in section 7345(c) of this title, as long as a determination under this subparagraph would not disproportionately affect any State.
<br>(2) Determination of initial amount
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The initial amount referred to in paragraph (1) is equal to $100 multiplied by the total number of students in excess of 50 students, in average daily attendance at the schools served by the local educational agency, plus $20,000, except that the initial amount may not exceed $60,000.
<br>(B) Special rule
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year for which the amount made available to carry out this part is $265,000,000 or more, subparagraph (A) shall be applied—
<br>
<br>(i) by substituting "$25,000" for "$20,000"; and
<br>
<br>(ii) by substituting "$80,000" for "$60,000".
<br>(3) Ratable adjustment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the amount made available to carry out this section for any fiscal year is not sufficient to pay in full the amounts that local educational agencies are eligible to receive under paragraph (1) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce such amounts for such year.
<br>(B) Additional amounts
<br>
<br>If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.
<br>(4) Hold harmless
<br>
<br>For a local educational agency that is not eligible under this subpart due to amendments made by the Every Student Succeeds Act to section 7345(b)(1)(A)(ii) of this title but met the eligibility requirements under section 7345(b) of this title as such section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015, the agency shall receive—

<br>(2) Allotment
<br>
<br>From amounts described in paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State educational agency for that fiscal year an amount that bears the same ratio to those amounts as the number of students in average daily attendance served by eligible local educational agencies in the State for that fiscal year bears to the number of all such students served by eligible local educational agencies in all States for that fiscal year.
<br>(3) Specially qualified agencies
<br>(A) Eligibility and application
<br>
<br>If a State educational agency elects not to participate in the program under this subpart or does not have an application submitted under section 7351b of this title approved, a specially qualified agency in such State desiring a grant under this subpart may submit an application under such section directly to the Secretary to receive an award under this subpart.
<br>(B) Direct awards
<br>

<br>(C) Specially qualified agency defined
<br>
<br>In this subpart, the term "specially qualified agency" means an eligible local educational agency served by a State educational agency that does not participate in a program under this subpart in a fiscal year, that may apply directly to the Secretary for a grant in such year under this subsection.

<br>(2) Certification
<br>

<br>
<br>A State educational agency shall award grants to eligible local educational agencies—

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13592. Improving American Indian and Alaska Native Educational Opportunities and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13592, Dec. 2, 2011, 76 F.R. 76603, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The United States has a unique political and legal relationship with the federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) tribes across the country, as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, Executive Orders, and court decisions. For centuries, the Federal Government's relationship with these tribes has been guided by a trust responsibility—a long-standing commitment on the part of our Government to protect the unique rights and ensure the well-being of our Nation's tribes, while respecting their tribal sovereignty. In recognition of that special commitment—and in fulfillment of the solemn obligations it entails—Federal agencies must help improve educational opportunities provided to all AI/AN students, including students attending public schools in cities and in rural areas, students attending schools operated and funded by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and students attending postsecondary institutions, including Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). This is an urgent need. Recent studies show that AI/AN students are dropping out of school at an alarming rate, that our Nation has made little or no progress in closing the achievement gap between AI/AN students and their non-AI/AN student counterparts, and that many Native languages are on the verge of extinction.
<br>
<br>It is the policy of my Administration to support activities that will strengthen the Nation by expanding educational opportunities and improving educational outcomes for all AI/AN students in order to fulfill our commitment to furthering tribal self-determination and to help ensure that AI/AN students have an opportunity to learn their Native languages and histories and receive complete and competitive educations that prepare them for college, careers, and productive and satisfying lives.
<br>
<br>My Administration is also committed to improving educational opportunities for students attending TCUs. TCUs maintain, preserve, and restore Native languages and cultural traditions; offer a high-quality college education; provide career and technical education, job training, and other career-building programs; and often serve as anchors in some of the country's poorest and most remote areas.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) "Agency" means any executive department or agency designated by the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Interior to participate in this order.
<br>
<br>(b) "Indian tribe" means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a [et seq., now 25 U.S.C. 5130 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(c) "American Indian and Alaska Native" means a member of an Indian tribe, as membership is defined by the tribe.
<br>
<br>(d) "Public school" means a Head Start center or a pre-kindergarten, elementary, or secondary school that is predominantly funded by public means through the Federal Government, a State, a local educational agency, or an Indian tribal government, including a school operated directly by or through contract or grant with the BIE, an Indian tribe, or a State, county, or local government.
<br>
<br>(e) "Tribal Colleges and Universities" are those institutions that are chartered by their respective Indian tribes through the sovereign authority of the tribes or by the Federal Government, and defined in section 316 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1059c).
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education.
<br>
<br>(a) Establishment. There is hereby established the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Initiative). The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Interior will co-chair the Initiative. The Secretary of Education shall appoint an Executive Director who shall be responsible for overseeing implementation of the Initiative. This individual shall be a senior-level, Department of Education official who shall serve as the Secretary of Education's senior policy advisor on Federal policies affecting AI/AN education.
<br>
<br>The Executive Director shall work closely with the BIE Director and shall provide periodic reports to the Secretaries of Education and the Interior regarding progress achieved under the Initiative. The Executive Director shall coordinate frequent consultations with tribal officials and shall provide staff support for the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE), authorized by section 7141 [now 6141] of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) (20 U.S.C. 7471).
<br>
<br>(b) Mission and Functions. (1) The Initiative shall help expand educational opportunities and improve educational outcomes for all AI/AN students, including opportunities to learn their Native languages, cultures, and histories and receive complete and competitive educations that prepare them for college, careers, and productive and satisfying lives, by:
<br>
<br>(i) working closely with the Executive Office of the President to help ensure AI/AN participation in the development and implementation of key Administration priorities;
<br>
<br>(ii) strengthening the relationship between the Department of Education, which has substantial expertise and resources to help improve Indian education, and the Department of the Interior and its BIE, which directly operates or provides grants to tribes to operate an extensive primary, secondary, and college level school system for AI/AN children and young adults;
<br>
<br>(iii) coordinating, in consultation with the Department of Education's Director of Indian Education, programs administered by the Department of Education and other executive branch agencies regarding AI/AN education;
<br>
<br>(iv) serving as a liaison with other executive branch agencies on AI/AN issues and advising those agencies on how they might help to promote AI/AN educational opportunities;
<br>
<br>(v) reporting on the development, implementation, and coordination of education policy and programs that affect AI/AN students;
<br>
<br>(vi) furthering tribal sovereignty by supporting efforts, consistent with applicable law, to build the capacity of tribal educational agencies and TCUs to provide high-quality education services to AI/AN children;
<br>
<br>(vii) developing in partnership with tribal educational agencies a more routine and streamlined process for entering into agreements for educational studies conducted on tribal lands;
<br>
<br>(viii) developing sufficient data resources to inform progress on Federal performance indicators, in close collaboration with the Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics;
<br>
<br>(ix) encouraging and coordinating Federal partnerships with public, private, philanthropic, and nonprofit entities to help increase the readiness of AI/AN students for school, college, and careers, and to help increase the number and percentage of AI/AN students completing college; and
<br>
<br>(x) developing a national network of individuals, organizations, and communities to share best practices in AI/AN education and encouraging them to implement these practices.
<br>
<br>(2) In order to help expand educational opportunities and improve education outcomes for AI/AN students, the Initiative shall promote, encourage, and undertake efforts, consistent with applicable law, to meet the following objectives:
<br>
<br>(i) increasing the number and percentage of AI/AN children who enter kindergarten ready for success through improved access to high-quality early learning programs and services, including Native language immersion programs, that encourage the learning and development of AI/AN children from birth through age five;
<br>
<br>(ii) supporting the expanded implementation of education reform strategies that have shown evidence of success in enabling AI/AN students to acquire a rigorous and well-rounded education and increasing their access to the support services that prepare them for college, careers, and civic involvement;
<br>
<br>(iii) increasing the number and percentage of AI/AN students who have access to excellent teachers and school leaders, including effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), language, and special education teachers, in part by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, development, and retention of effective AI/AN teachers and other effective teachers and school leaders, particularly through TCUs;
<br>
<br>(iv) reducing the AI/AN student dropout rate and helping a greater number and percentage of those students who stay in high school to be ready for college and careers by the time of their graduation and college completion, in part by promoting a positive school climate and supporting successful and innovative dropout-prevention and recovery strategies that better engage AI/AN youths in their learning and help them catch up academically;
<br>
<br>(v) providing pathways that enable those who have dropped out to reenter educational or training programs and acquire degrees, certificates, or industry-recognized credentials and obtain quality jobs, and expanding access to high-quality education programs leading to career advancement, especially in the STEM fields, by supporting adult, career, and technical education;
<br>
<br>(vi) increasing college access and completion for AI/AN students through strategies to strengthen the capacity of postsecondary institutions, particularly TCUs; and
<br>
<br>(vii) helping to ensure that the unique cultural, educational, and language needs of AI/AN students are met.
<br>
<br>(3) To facilitate a new partnership between the Department of Education and the Department of the Interior, to improve AI/AN education, the Executive Director shall work with the BIE Director and develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two Departments that will take advantage of both Departments' expertise, resources, and facilities.
