<br>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 89–554, §4(c), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 616.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The section is supplied for convenience and clarification. The Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice, the earliest predecessor agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was created administratively in 1908. It appears that funds used for the Bureau of Investigation were first obtained through the Department of Justice Appropriation Act of May 22, 1908, ch. 186, §1 (par. beginning "From the appropriations for the prosecution of crimes"), 35 Stat. 236, although that statutory provision makes no express mention of the Bureau or of the investigative function.
<br>
<br>Section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, specifically recognized the Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice and provided that all that Bureau's functions together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition were "transferred to and consolidated in a Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation."
<br>
<br>The Division of Investigation was first designated as the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The section is supplied for convenience and clarification and is based on section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, which provided for the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Investigation together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition to a "Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation". The Division of Investigation was first designated as the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date. The title of "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation" was recognized by statute in the Act of June 5, 1936, ch. 529, 49 Stat. 1484, and has been used in statutes since that date.

<br>Pub. L. 112–24, §1, July 26, 2011, 125 Stat. 238, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) on May 12, 2011, the President requested that Congress extend the term of Robert S. Mueller III as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by 2 years, citing the critical need for continuity and stability at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the face of ongoing threats to the United States and leadership transitions at the Federal agencies charged with protecting national security;
<br>
<br>"(2) in light of the May 1, 2011, successful operation against Osama bin Laden, the continuing threat to national security, and the approaching 10th anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, the President's request for a limited, 1-time exception to the term limit of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in these exceptional circumstances, is appropriate; and

<br>
<br>(2) to assist in the protection of the person of the President; and 1
<br>

<br>
<br>(4) to conduct such other investigations regarding official matters under the control of the Department of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by the Attorney General.

<br>This section does not limit the authority of departments and agencies to investigate crimes against the United States when investigative jurisdiction has been assigned by law to such departments and agencies.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 89–554, §4(c), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 616; amended Pub. L. 107–273, div. A, title II, §204(e), Nov. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 1776.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes Derivation	U.S. Code	Revised Statutes and
<br>
<br>Statutes at Large
<br>	5 U.S.C. 299, 300 (less applicability to acquisition etc. of identification and other records). 	Aug. 31, 1964, Pub. L. 88–527, §201 (1st 105 words of 1st par. under "Federal Bureau of Investigation", less applicability to acquisition etc. of identification and other records), 78 Stat. 717.
<br>
<br>The section is from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under sections 299 and 300 of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.
<br>
<br>The section is reorganized for clarity. The authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied. The word "may" is substituted for "is authorized to". The words "who shall be vested with the authority necessary for the execution of such duties" are omitted as unnecessary as the appointment of the officials for the purposes indicated carries with it the authority necessary to perform their duties.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (2), the words "to assist in" are added for clarity and in recognition of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3056 which vest in the United States Secret Service the responsibility for the protection of the person of the President. As so revised, this paragraph will assure that the Secret Service will continue to have primary responsibility for the protection of the President but at the same time will permit the Federal Bureau of Investigation to render assistance in such protection.
<br>
<br>The last sentence is added because in various areas the authority to investigate certain criminal offenses has been specifically assigned by statute to departments and agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For example, the enforcement of the internal revenue laws is specifically a function of the Secretary of the Treasury and he is authorized to employ such number of persons as he deems proper for the enforcement of such laws (26 U.S.C. 7801, 7803). The Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to direct the collection of duties on imports and to appoint such employees for that purpose as he deems necessary (19 U.S.C. 3, 6). The U.S. Coast Guard is specifically authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing the Federal laws upon the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (14 U.S.C. 2). Subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secret Service is specifically authorized to detect and arrest persons committing offenses against the laws of the United States relating to coins and obligations and securities of the United States and foreign governments (18 U.S.C. 3056).

<br>
<br>"(3) As soon as the proceeds from an undercover investigative operation with respect to which an action is authorized and carried out under subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (1), or under paragraph (2) are no longer necessary for the conduct of such operation, such proceeds or the balance of such proceeds remaining at the time shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>

The proceeds of the liquidation, sale, or other disposition, after obligations are met, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) The Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the case may be, shall conduct a detailed financial audit of each undercover investigative operation which is closed in fiscal year 1996—
<br>
<br>"(i) submit the results of such audit in writing to the Attorney General, and

<br>
<br>"(iii) the number, by programs, of undercover investigative operations closed in the one-year period preceding the period for which such report is submitted and, with respect to each such closed undercover operation, the results obtained. With respect to each such closed undercover operation which involves any of the sensitive circumstances specified in the Attorney General's Guidelines on Federal Bureau of Investigation Undercover Operations, such report shall contain a detailed description of the operation and related matters, including information pertaining to—
<br>
<br>"(I) the results,
<br>
<br>"(II) any civil claims, and
<br>
<br>"(III) identification of such sensitive circumstances involved, that arose at any time during the course of such undercover operation.
<br>
<br>"(6) For purposes of paragraph (5)—
<br>
<br>"(A) the term 'closed' refers to the earliest point in time at which—
<br>
<br>"(i) all criminal proceedings (other than appeals) are concluded, or
<br>
<br>"(ii) covert activities are concluded, whichever occurs later,

<br>Historical and Revision Notes Derivation	U.S. Code	Revised Statutes and
<br>
<br>Statutes at Large
<br>	5 U.S.C. 300 (as applicable to acquisition etc. of identification and other records). 	Aug. 31, 1964, Pub. L. 88–527, §201 (1st 105 words of 1st par. under "Federal Bureau of Investigation", as applicable to acquisition etc. of identification and other records), 78 Stat. 717.
<br>	5 U.S.C. 340. 	June 11, 1930, ch. 455, 46 Stat. 554.
<br>
<br>The sections are combined and reorganized for clarity. Former section 300 of title 5 was from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department of Justice running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under former section 300 of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the word "shall" is substituted for "has the duty" as a more direct expression. The function of acquiring, collecting, classifying, etc., referred to in former section 340 of title 5 was transferred to the Attorney General by 1950 Reorg., Plan No. 2, §1, eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1261, which is codified in section 509 of this title. Accordingly, the first 29 words and last 30 words of former section 340 are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied.
