<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a student borrower who has received a loan described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 1078(a)(1) of this title dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled (as determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary), or if a student borrower who has received such a loan is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death, has lasted for a continuous period of not less than 60 months, or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 60 months then the Secretary shall discharge the borrower's liability on the loan by repaying the amount owed on the loan. The Secretary may develop such safeguards as the Secretary determines necessary to prevent fraud and abuse in the discharge of liability under this subsection. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Secretary may promulgate regulations to reinstate the obligation of, and resume collection on, loans discharged under this subsection in any case in which—
<br>
<br>(A) a borrower received a discharge of liability under this subsection and after the discharge the borrower—
<br>
<br>(i) receives a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this subchapter; or
<br>
<br>(ii) has earned income in excess of the poverty line; or
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary determines the reinstatement and resumption to be necessary.
<br>(2) Disability determinations
<br>
<br>A borrower who has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected condition and who provides documentation of such determination to the Secretary of Education, shall be considered permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of discharging such borrower's loans under this subsection, and such borrower shall not be required to present additional documentation for purposes of this subsection.
<br>(3) Automatic income monitoring
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish and implement, with respect to any borrower described in subparagraph (B), procedures to—
<br>
<br>(i) use return information disclosed under section 6103(l)(13) of title 26, pursuant to approval provided under section 1098h of this title, to determine the borrower's continued eligibility for the loan discharge described in subparagraph (B);
<br>
<br>(ii) allow the borrower, at any time, to opt out of disclosure under such section 6103(l)(13) and instead provide such information as the Secretary may require to determine the borrower's continued eligibility for such loan discharge; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide the borrower with an opportunity to update the return information so disclosed before determination of such borrower's continued eligibility for such loan discharge.
<br>(B) Applicability
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall apply—
<br>
<br>(i) to each borrower of a loan that is discharged due to the total and permanent disability (within the meaning of this subsection) of the borrower; and
<br>
<br>(ii) during the period beginning on the date on which such loan is so discharged and ending on the first day on which such loan may no longer be reinstated.
<br>(b) Payment of claims on loans in bankruptcy
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall pay to the holder of a loan described in section 1078(a)(1)(A) or (B), 1078–1,1 1078–2, 1078–3, or 1078–8 of this title, the amount of the unpaid balance of principal and interest owed on such loan—
<br>
<br>(1) when the borrower files for relief under chapter 12 or 13 of title 11;
<br>
<br>(2) when the borrower who has filed for relief under chapter 7 or 11 of such title commences an action for a determination of dischargeability under section 523(a)(8)(B) of such title; or
<br>
<br>(3) for loans described in section 523(a)(8)(A) of such title, when the borrower files for relief under chapter 7 or 11 of such title.
<br>(c) Discharge
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a borrower who received, on or after January 1, 1986, a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part and the student borrower, or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed, is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution or if such student's eligibility to borrow under this part was falsely certified by the eligible institution or was falsely certified as a result of a crime of identity theft, or if the institution failed to make a refund of loan proceeds which the institution owed to such student's lender, then the Secretary shall discharge the borrower's liability on the loan (including interest and collection fees) by repaying the amount owed on the loan and shall subsequently pursue any claim available to such borrower against the institution and its affiliates and principals or settle the loan obligation pursuant to the financial responsibility authority under subpart 3 of part H. In the case of a discharge based upon a failure to refund, the amount of the discharge shall not exceed that portion of the loan which should have been refunded. The Secretary shall report to the authorizing committees annually as to the dollar amount of loan discharges attributable to failures to make refunds.

<br>(4) Special rule
<br>
<br>A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded from receiving additional grants, loans, or work assistance under this subchapter for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on such discharged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection shall be treated the same as loans under section 1087ee(a)(5) of this title.
<br>(5) Reporting
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall report to consumer reporting agencies with respect to loans which have been discharged pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(d) Repayment of loans to parents

<br>Discharging the Federal Student Loan Debt of Totally and Permanently Disabled Veterans
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 21, 2019, 84 F.R. 44677, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of Education [and] the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
<br>
<br>Since our Founding, the United States has been blessed with men and women willing to serve in defense of our Nation and our ideals. Many of those answering the call to serve make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and many others carry physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives.
<br>
<br>The Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act in 2008 and other acts (Higher Education Act), honors veterans who are totally and permanently disabled as a result of their service to the Nation by providing for the discharge of their Federal student loan debt. Borrowers who have been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected condition and who provide documentation of that determination to the Secretary of Education are entitled to the discharge of such debt.
<br>
<br>For the last decade, veterans seeking loan discharges have been required to submit an application to the Secretary of Education with proof of their disabilities obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The process has been overly complicated and difficult, and prevented too many of our veterans from receiving the relief for which they are eligible. This has inflicted significant hardship and serious harm on these veterans and has frustrated the intent of the Congress that their Federal student loan debt be discharged.
<br>
<br>Only half of the approximately 50,000 totally and permanently disabled veterans who currently qualify for the discharge of their Federal student loan debt have availed themselves of the benefits provided to them by the Higher Education Act. This has created a serious and critical problem for disabled veterans, who must deal with the day-to-day consequences of their service-connected injuries, and for our military, as readiness and recruitment suffer when we do not take care of our veterans. There is a pressing need to quickly and effectively resolve this problem. Therefore, my Administration will take prompt action to ensure that all totally and permanently disabled veterans are able to obtain, with minimal burden, the Federal student loan debt discharges to which they are legally entitled.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to express the gratitude of our Nation for the service of our totally and permanently disabled veterans, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to facilitate—in a manner that is quick, efficient, and minimally burdensome—the discharge of Federal student loan debt for totally and permanently disabled veterans.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Directive to the Secretaries of Education and Veterans Affairs. (a) The Secretary of Education is hereby directed to develop as soon as practicable a process, consistent with applicable law, to facilitate the swift and effective discharge of the Federal student loan debt of totally and permanently disabled veterans pursuant to section 437 of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1087; section 455 of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1087e; and section 464 of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1087dd. To the maximum extent feasible and consistent with applicable law, the process developed by the Secretary of Education should account for and make use of disability determinations made available to the Secretary of Education by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretaries of Education and Veterans Affairs (Secretaries) shall take appropriate action to implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this memorandum as expeditiously as possible. To that end, the Secretaries shall consider all pathways for the Department of Veterans Affairs to share disability determinations with the Department of Education, so that veterans may be relieved of the burdensome administrative impediments to Federal student loan debt discharge.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Definitions. As used in this memorandum:
<br>
<br>(a) the term "Federal student loan debt" means liability to repay Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans, and Federal Perkins Loans.
<br>
<br>(b) the term "discharge" means discharge of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loan Program loans and cancellation of Federal Perkins Loans.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>Donald J. Trump.

<br>§1087–1. Special allowances
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.
<br>(b) Computation and payment
<br>(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance
<br>
<br>A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.
<br>(2) Rate of special allowance
<br>
<br>(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (I) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(i) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this clause, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting "3.5 percent" for "3.10 percent". Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.
<br>
<br>(ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.
<br>
<br>(iii) No special allowance may be paid under this subparagraph unless the issuer of such obligations complies with subsection (d) of this section.
<br>
<br>(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which are financed with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations originally issued on or after October 1, 1993, or refunded after September 30, 2004, the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26, shall be the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) as the case may be. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.
<br>
<br>(v) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance shall be the rate determined under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) of this paragraph, or paragraph (4), as the case may be, for a holder of loans that—
<br>
<br>(I) were made or purchased with funds—
<br>
<br>(aa) obtained from the issuance of obligations the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26 and which obligations were originally issued before October 1, 1993; or
<br>
<br>(bb) obtained from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in division (aa), or from income on the investment of such funds; and

<br>
<br>(cc) sold or transferred to any other holder after September 30, 2004.
<br>
<br>(vi) Notwithstanding clauses (i), (ii), and (v), but subject to clause (vii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance shall be the rate determined under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) of this paragraph, as the case may be, for a holder of loans—
<br>
<br>(I) that were made or purchased on or after February 8, 2006; or
<br>
<br>(II) that were not earning a quarterly rate of special allowance determined under clauses (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as of February 8, 2006.
<br>
<br>(vii) Clause (vi) shall be applied by substituting "December 31, 2010" for "February 8, 2006" in the case of a holder of loans that—

<br>
<br>(F) Subject to paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans for which the applicable rate of interest is determined under section 1077a(h) of this title shall be computed (i) by determining the applicable bond equivalent rate of the security with a comparable maturity, as established by the Secretary, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rates on such loans from such applicable bond equivalent rate, (iii) by adding 1.0 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(i) of this title.

<br>
<br>(aa) In general.—A waiver pursuant to subclause (II) shall be in a form (printed or electronic) prescribed by the Secretary, and shall be applicable to—

<br>
<br>(BB) all loans described in such subclause for which the beneficial owner has the authority to make an election of a waiver under such subclause, regardless of the lender identification number associated with the loan or the lender that holds the loan as eligible lender trustee on behalf of such beneficial owner; and
<br>
<br>(CC) all future calculations of the special allowance on loans that, on the date of such waiver, are loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB), or that, after such date, become loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB).
<br>
<br>(bb) Exceptions.—Any waiver pursuant to subclause (II) that is elected for loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB) of item (aa) shall not apply to any loan described in such subitem for which the lender or beneficial owner of the loan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
<br>
<br>(AA) in accordance with an agreement entered into before the date of enactment of this section by which such lender or owner is governed and that applies to such loans, such lender or owner is not legally permitted to make an election of such waiver with respect to such loans without the approval of one or more third parties with an interest in the loans, and that the lender or owner followed all available options under such agreement to obtain such approval, and was unable to do so; or
<br>
<br>(BB) such lender or beneficial owner presented the proposal of electing such a waiver applicable to such loans associated with an obligation rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined in section 78c(a)(62) of title 15), and such rating organization provided a written opinion that the agency would downgrade the rating applicable to such obligation if the lender or owner elected such a waiver.
<br>(3) Contractual right of holders to special allowance
<br>
<br>The holder of an eligible loan shall be deemed to have a contractual right against the United States, during the life of such loan, to receive the special allowance according to the provisions of this section.

<br>(4) Penalty for late payment
<br>
<br>(A) If payments of the special allowances payable under this section or of interest payments under section 1078(a) of this title with respect to a loan have not been made within 30 days after the Secretary has received an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment thereof, the special allowance payable to such holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the daily interest accruing on the special allowance and interest benefits payments due the holder.
<br>
<br>(B) Such daily interest shall be computed at the daily equivalent rate of the sum of the special allowance rate computed pursuant to paragraph (2) and the interest rate applicable to the loan and shall be paid for the later of (i) the 31st day after the receipt of such request for payment from the holder, or (ii) the 31st day after the final day of the period or periods covered by such request, and shall be paid for each succeeding day until, and including, the date on which the Secretary authorizes payment.

<br>(ii) which is made under section 1078–1,1 1078–2, 1078–3, 1078–8, or 1087–2(o) of this title; or
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Secretary shall collect the amount the lender is authorized to charge as an origination fee in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) by reducing the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, to any holder; or
<br>
<br>(ii) directly from the holder of the loan, if the lender fails or is not required to bill the Secretary for interest and special allowance or withdraws from the program with unpaid loan origination fees.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Secretary collects the origination fee under this subsection through the reduction of interest and special allowance, and the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, is less than the amount the lender was authorized to charge borrowers for origination fees in that quarter, the Secretary shall deduct the excess amount from the subsequent quarters' payments until the total amount has been deducted.
<br>(2) Amount of origination fees

<br>(3) Relation to applicable interest
<br>
<br>Such origination fee shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining compliance with section 1077a of this title.
<br>(4) Disclosure required
<br>
<br>The lender shall disclose to the borrower the amount and method of calculating the origination fee.
<br>(5) Prohibition on department compelling origination fee collections by lenders
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Secretary to require any lender that is making loans that are insured or guaranteed under this part, but for which no amount will be payable for interest under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title or for special allowances under subsection (b) of this section, to collect any origination fee or to submit the sums collected as origination fees to the United States.

<br>(7) Distribution of origination fees
<br>
<br>All origination fees collected pursuant to this section on loans authorized under section 1078–1 1 or 1078–2 of this title shall be paid to the Secretary by the lender and deposited in the fund authorized under section 1081 of this title.
<br>(8) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a lender may assess a lesser origination fee for a borrower demonstrating greater financial need as determined by such borrower's adjusted gross family income.
<br>(d) Loan fees from lenders
<br>(1) Deduction from interest and special allowance subsidies
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Secretary shall collect a loan fee in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (2)—
<br>
<br>(i) by reducing the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b), respectively, to any holder of a loan; or
<br>
<br>(ii) directly from the holder of the loan, if the lender—
<br>
<br>(I) fails or is not required to bill the Secretary for interest and special allowance payments; or
<br>
<br>(II) withdraws from the program with unpaid loan fees.
<br>(B) Special rule
<br>
<br>If the Secretary collects loan fees under this subsection through the reduction of interest and special allowance payments, and the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b), respectively, is less than the amount of such loan fees, then the Secretary shall deduct the amount of the loan fee balance from the amount of interest and special allowance payments that would otherwise be payable, in subsequent quarterly increments until the balance has been deducted.
<br>(2) Amount of loan fees
<br>
<br>The amount of the loan fee which shall be deducted under paragraph (1), but which may not be collected from the borrower, shall be equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), 0.50 percent of the principal amount of the loan with respect to any loan under this part for which the first disbursement was made on or after October 1, 1993; and
<br>
<br>(B) 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan with respect to any loan under this part for which the first disbursement was made on or after October 1, 2007, and before July 1, 2010.
<br>(3) Distribution of loan fees
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall deposit all fees collected pursuant to paragraph (3) into the insurance fund established in section 1081 of this title.
<br>(e) Nondiscrimination
<br>
<br>In order for the holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from an Authority issuing obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26, to be eligible to receive a special allowance under subsection (b)(2) on any such loans, the Authority shall not engage in any pattern or practice which results in a denial of a borrower's access to loans under this part because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, disability status, income, attendance at a particular eligible institution within the area served by the Authority, length of the borrower's educational program, or the borrower's academic year in school.
<br>(f) Regulations to prevent denial of loans to eligible students
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall adopt or amend appropriate regulations pertaining to programs carried out under this part to prevent, where practicable, any practices which the Secretary finds have denied loans to a substantial number of eligible students.
<br>(g) Special Rule
<br>
<br>With respect to any loan made under this part for which the interest rate is determined under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. 527) [now 50 U.S.C. 3937],1 the applicable interest rate to be subtracted in calculating the special allowance for such loan under this section shall be the interest rate determined under that Act for such loan.
