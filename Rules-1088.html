<br>§360h. Notification and other remedies
<br>(a) Notification
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) a device intended for human use which is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health, and
<br>
<br>(2) notification under this subsection is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more practicable means is available under the provisions of this chapter (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure that adequate notification is provided in an appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under the circumstances involved, to all health professionals who prescribe or use the device and to any other person (including manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers, and device users) who should properly receive such notification in order to eliminate such risk. An order under this subsection shall require that the individuals subject to the risk with respect to which the order is to be issued be included in the persons to be notified of the risk unless the Secretary determines that notice to such individuals would present a greater danger to the health of such individuals than no such notification. If the Secretary makes such a determination with respect to such individuals, the order shall require that the health professionals who prescribe or use the device provide for the notification of the individuals whom the health professionals treated with the device of the risk presented by the device and of any action which may be taken by or on behalf of such individuals to eliminate or reduce such risk. Before issuing an order under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the persons who are to give notice under the order.
<br>(b) Repair, replacement, or refund
<br>
<br>(1)(A) If, after affording opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) a device intended for human use which is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health,
<br>
<br>(ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the device was not properly designed or manufactured with reference to the state of the art as it existed at the time of its design or manufacture,
<br>
<br>(iii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the unreasonable risk was not caused by failure of a person other than a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the device to exercise due care in the installation, maintenance, repair, or use of the device, and
<br>
<br>(iv) the notification authorized by subsection (a) would not by itself be sufficient to eliminate the unreasonable risk and action described in paragraph (2) of this subsection is necessary to eliminate such risk,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may order the manufacturer, importer, or any distributor of such device, or any combination of such persons, to submit to him within a reasonable time a plan for taking one or more of the actions described in paragraph (2). An order issued under the preceding sentence which is directed to more than one person shall specify which person may decide which action shall be taken under such plan and the person specified shall be the person who the Secretary determines bears the principal, ultimate financial responsibility for action taken under the plan unless the Secretary cannot determine who bears such responsibility or the Secretary determines that the protection of the public health requires that such decision be made by a person (including a device user or health professional) other than the person he determines bears such responsibility.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall approve a plan submitted pursuant to an order issued under subparagraph (A) unless he determines (after affording opportunity for an informal hearing) that the action or actions to be taken under the plan or the manner in which such action or actions are to be taken under the plan will not assure that the unreasonable risk with respect to which such order was issued will be eliminated. If the Secretary disapproves a plan, he shall order a revised plan to be submitted to him within a reasonable time. If the Secretary determines (after affording opportunity for an informal hearing) that the revised plan is unsatisfactory or if no revised plan or no initial plan has been submitted to the Secretary within the prescribed time, the Secretary shall (i) prescribe a plan to be carried out by the person or persons to whom the order issued under subparagraph (A) was directed, or (ii) after affording an opportunity for an informal hearing, by order prescribe a plan to be carried out by a person who is a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the device with respect to which the order was issued but to whom the order under subparagraph (A) was not directed.
<br>
<br>(2) The actions which may be taken under a plan submitted under an order issued under paragraph (1) are as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) To repair the device so that it does not present the unreasonable risk of substantial harm with respect to which the order under paragraph (1) was issued.
<br>
<br>(B) To replace the device with a like or equivalent device which is in conformity with all applicable requirements of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(C) To refund the purchase price of the device (less a reasonable allowance for use if such device has been in the possession of the device user for one year or more—
<br>
<br>(i) at the time of notification ordered under subsection (a), or
<br>
<br>(ii) at the time the device user receives actual notice of the unreasonable risk with respect to which the order was issued under paragraph (1),
<br>
<br>whichever first occurs).
<br>
<br>(3) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, importer, distributor or retailer) for availing himself of any remedy, described in paragraph (2) and provided under an order issued under paragraph (1), and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses actually incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy.
<br>(c) Reimbursement
<br>
<br>An order issued under subsection (b) with respect to a device may require any person who is a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the device to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer of such device for such other person's expenses actually incurred in connection with carrying out the order if the Secretary determines such reimbursement is required for the protection of the public health. Any such requirement shall not affect any rights or obligations under any contract to which the person receiving reimbursement or the person making such reimbursement is a party.
<br>(d) Effect on other liability
<br>
<br>Compliance with an order issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law. In awarding damages for economic loss in an action brought for the enforcement of any such liability, the value to the plaintiff in such action of any remedy provided him under such order shall be taken into account.
<br>(e) Recall authority
<br>
<br>(1) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that a device intended for human use would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring the appropriate person (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers of the device)—
<br>
<br>(A) to immediately cease distribution of such device, and
<br>
<br>(B) to immediately notify health professionals and device user facilities of the order and to instruct such professionals and facilities to cease use of such device.
<br>
<br>The order shall provide the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of the order, on the actions required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to require a recall of such device. If, after providing an opportunity for such a hearing, the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the actions required by the order, the Secretary shall vacate the order.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that the order should be amended to include a recall of the device with respect to which the order was issued, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), amend the order to require a recall. The Secretary shall specify a timetable in which the device recall will occur and shall require periodic reports to the Secretary describing the progress of the recall.
<br>
<br>(B) An amended order under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) shall—
<br>
<br>(I) not include recall of a device from individuals, and
<br>
<br>(II) not include recall of a device from device user facilities if the Secretary determines that the risk of recalling such device from the facilities presents a greater health risk than the health risk of not recalling the device from use, and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall provide for notice to individuals subject to the risks associated with the use of such device.
<br>
<br>In providing the notice required by clause (ii), the Secretary may use the assistance of health professionals who prescribed or used such a device for individuals. If a significant number of such individuals cannot be identified, the Secretary shall notify such individuals pursuant to section 375(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The remedy provided by this subsection shall be in addition to remedies provided by subsections (a), (b), and (c).

<br>§360i. Records and reports on devices
<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>Every person who is a manufacturer or importer of a device intended for human use shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may by regulation reasonably require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness. Regulations prescribed under the preceding sentence—
<br>
<br>(1) shall require a device manufacturer or importer to report to the Secretary whenever the manufacturer or importer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed devices—
<br>
<br>(A) may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or
<br>
<br>(B) has malfunctioned and that such device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer or importer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur, which report under this subparagraph—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be submitted in accordance with part 803 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), unless the Secretary grants an exemption or variance from, or an alternative to, a requirement under such regulations pursuant to section 803.19 of such part, if the device involved is—
<br>
<br>(I) a class III device;
<br>
<br>(II) a class II device that is permanently implantable, is life supporting, or is life sustaining; or
<br>
<br>(III) a type of device which the Secretary has, by notice published in the Federal Register or letter to the person who is the manufacturer or importer of the device, indicated should be subject to such part 803 in order to protect the public health;
<br>
<br>(ii) shall, if the device is not subject to clause (i), be submitted in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary for reports made pursuant to this clause, which criteria shall require the reports to be in summary form and made on a quarterly basis; or
<br>
<br>(iii) shall, if the device is imported into the United States and for which part 803 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations) requires an importer to submit a report to the manufacturer, be submitted by the importer to the manufacturer in accordance with part 803 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations) 1
<br>
<br>(2) shall define the term "serious injury" to mean an injury that—
<br>
<br>(A) is life threatening,
<br>
<br>(B) results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
<br>
<br>(C) necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure;
<br>
<br>(3) shall require reporting of other significant adverse device experiences as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to be reported;
<br>
<br>(4) shall not impose requirements unduly burdensome to a device manufacturer or importer taking into account his cost of complying with such requirements and the need for the protection of the public health and the implementation of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(5) which prescribe the procedure for making requests for reports or information shall require that each request made under such regulations for submission of a report or information to the Secretary state the reason or purpose for such request and identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or information;
<br>
<br>(6) which require submission of a report or information to the Secretary shall state the reason or purpose for the submission of such report or information and identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or information;
<br>
<br>(7) may not require that the identity of any patient be disclosed in records, reports, or information required under this subsection unless required for the medical welfare of an individual, to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device, or to verify a record, report, or information submitted under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(8) may not require a manufacturer or importer of a class I device to—
<br>
<br>(A) maintain for such a device records respecting information not in the possession of the manufacturer or importer, or
<br>
<br>(B) to submit for such a device to the Secretary any report or information—
<br>
<br>(i) not in the possession of the manufacturer or importer, or
<br>
<br>(ii) on a periodic basis,
<br>
<br>unless such report or information is necessary to determine if the device should be reclassified or if the device is adulterated or misbranded. and 2
<br>
<br>In prescribing such regulations, the Secretary shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests of patients. The prohibitions of paragraph (7) of this subsection continue to apply to records, reports, and information concerning any individual who has been a patient, irrespective of whether or when he ceases to be a patient. The Secretary shall by regulation require distributors to keep records and make such records available to the Secretary upon request. Paragraphs (4) and (8) apply to distributors to the same extent and in the same manner as such paragraphs apply to manufacturers and importers.
<br>(b) User reports
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Whenever a device user facility receives or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to the death of a patient of the facility, the facility shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 10 working days after becoming aware of the information, report the information to the Secretary and, if the identity of the manufacturer is known, to the manufacturer of the device. In the case of deaths, the Secretary may by regulation prescribe a shorter period for the reporting of such information.
<br>
<br>(B) Whenever a device user facility receives or otherwise becomes aware of—
<br>
<br>(i) information that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to the serious illness of, or serious injury to, a patient of the facility, or
<br>
<br>(ii) other significant adverse device experiences as determined by the Secretary by regulation to be necessary to be reported,
<br>
<br>the facility shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 10 working days after becoming aware of the information, report the information to the manufacturer of the device or to the Secretary if the identity of the manufacturer is not known.
<br>
<br>(C) Each device user facility shall submit to the Secretary on an annual basis a summary of the reports made under subparagraphs (A) and (B). Such summary shall be submitted on January 1 of each year. The summary shall be in such form and contain such information from such reports as the Secretary may require and shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) sufficient information to identify the facility which made the reports for which the summary is submitted,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of any product which was the subject of a report, the product name, serial number, and model number,
<br>
<br>(iii) the name and the address of the manufacturer of such device, and
<br>
<br>(iv) a brief description of the event reported to the manufacturer.
<br>
<br>(D) For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a device user facility shall be treated as having received or otherwise become aware of information with respect to a device of that facility when medical personnel who are employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with the facility receive or otherwise become aware of information with respect to that device in the course of their duties.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may not disclose the identity of a device user facility which makes a report under paragraph (1) except in connection with—
<br>
<br>(A) an action brought to enforce section 331(q) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) a communication to a manufacturer of a device which is the subject of a report under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>This paragraph does not prohibit the Secretary from disclosing the identity of a device user facility making a report under paragraph (1) or any information in such a report to employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, to the Department of Justice, or to the duly authorized committees and subcommittees of the Congress.
<br>
<br>(3) No report made under paragraph (1) by—
<br>
<br>(A) a device user facility,
<br>
<br>(B) an individual who is employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with such a facility, or
<br>
<br>(C) a physician who is not required to make such a report,
<br>
<br>shall be admissible into evidence or otherwise used in any civil action involving private parties unless the facility, individual, or physician who made the report had knowledge of the falsity of the information contained in the report.
<br>
<br>(4) A report made under paragraph (1) does not affect any obligation of a manufacturer who receives the report to file a report as required under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(5) With respect to device user facilities:
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary shall by regulation plan and implement a program under which the Secretary limits user reporting under paragraphs (1) through (4) to a subset of user facilities that constitutes a representative profile of user reports for device deaths and serious illnesses or serious injuries.
<br>
<br>(B) During the period of planning the program under subparagraph (A), paragraphs (1) through (4) continue to apply.
<br>
<br>(C) During the period in which the Secretary is providing for a transition to the full implementation of the program, paragraphs (1) through (4) apply except to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise.
<br>
<br>(D) On and after the date on which the program is fully implemented, paragraphs (1) through (4) do not apply to a user facility unless the facility is included in the subset referred to in subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(E) Not later than 2 years after November 21, 1997, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate, a report describing the plan developed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) and the progress that has been made toward the implementation of the plan.
<br>
<br>(6) For purposes of this subsection:
<br>
<br>(A) The term "device user facility" means a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, or outpatient treatment facility which is not a physician's office. The Secretary may by regulation include an outpatient diagnostic facility which is not a physician's office in such term.
<br>
<br>(B) The terms "serious illness" and "serious injury" mean illness or injury, respectively, that—
<br>
<br>(i) is life threatening,
<br>
<br>(ii) results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
<br>
<br>(iii) necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.
<br>(c) Persons exempt
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(1) any practitioner who is licensed by law to prescribe or administer devices intended for use in humans and who manufactures or imports devices solely for use in the course of his professional practice;
<br>
<br>(2) any person who manufactures or imports devices intended for use in humans solely for such person's use in research or teaching and not for sale (including any person who uses a device under an exemption granted under section 360j(g) of this title); and
<br>
<br>(3) any other class of persons as the Secretary may by regulation exempt from subsection (a) upon a finding that compliance with the requirements of such subsection by such class with respect to a device is not necessary to (A) assure that a device is not adulterated or misbranded or (B) otherwise to assure its safety and effectiveness.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–629, §3(c), Nov. 28, 1990, 104 Stat. 4514, as amended by Pub. L. 102–300, §2(a)(2), (3), June 16, 1992, 106 Stat. 238, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1)(A) Not later than 9 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 28, 1990], the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue proposed regulations—
<br>
<br>"(i) to require distributors of devices to establish and maintain records and to make reports (including reports required by part 803 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations) under section 519(a)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 360i(a)(6)], and

<br>"(2) Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement sections [sic] 519(a)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the Secretary does not promulgate such final regulations upon the expiration of such 18 months, the Congress finds that there is good cause for the proposed regulations to be considered as the final regulations without response to comment because the implementation of sections [sic] 519(a)(6) of such Act is essential to protect the health of patients who use such devices. Consequently, in such event, the proposed regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall become final regulations as of the expiration of such 18 months. There shall be promptly published in the Federal Register notice of the new status of the proposed regulations.

<br>"(3) Not later than November 28, 1992, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement section 519(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the Secretary does not promulgate such final regulations by November 28, 1992, the Congress finds that there is good cause for the proposed regulations to be considered as the final regulations without response to comment because the implementation of section 519(e) of such Act is essential to protect the health of patients who use devices. In such event, the proposed regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall become the issued final regulations on November 29, 1992. There shall be promptly published in the Federal Register notice of the new status of the proposed regulations."

<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>Any requirement authorized by or under section 351, 352, 360, or 360i of this title applicable to a device intended for human use shall apply to such device until the applicability of the requirement to the device has been changed by action taken under section 360c, 360d, or 360e of this title or under subsection (g) of this section, and any requirement established by or under section 351, 352, 360, or 360i of this title which is inconsistent with a requirement imposed on such device under section 360d or 360e of this title or under subsection (g) of this section shall not apply to such device.
<br>(b) Custom devices
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The requirements of sections 360d and 360e of this title shall not apply to a device that—
<br>
<br>(A) is created or modified in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist (or any other specially qualified person designated under regulations promulgated by the Secretary after an opportunity for an oral hearing);
<br>
<br>(B) in order to comply with an order described in subparagraph (A), necessarily deviates from an otherwise applicable performance standard under section 360d of this title or requirement under section 360e of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) is not generally available in the United States in finished form through labeling or advertising by the manufacturer, importer, or distributor for commercial distribution;
<br>
<br>(D) is designed to treat a unique pathology or physiological condition that no other device is domestically available to treat;
<br>
<br>(E)(i) is intended to meet the special needs of such physician or dentist (or other specially qualified person so designated) in the course of the professional practice of such physician or dentist (or other specially qualified person so designated); or
<br>
<br>(ii) is intended for use by an individual patient named in such order of such physician or dentist (or other specially qualified person so designated);
<br>
<br>(F) is assembled from components or manufactured and finished on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the unique needs of individuals described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (E); and
<br>
<br>(G) may have common, standardized design characteristics, chemical and material compositions, and manufacturing processes as commercially distributed devices.
<br>(2) Limitations
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall apply to a device only if—
<br>
<br>(A) such device is for the purpose of treating a sufficiently rare condition, such that conducting clinical investigations on such device would be impractical;
<br>
<br>(B) production of such device under paragraph (1) is limited to no more than 5 units per year of a particular device type, provided that such replication otherwise complies with this section; and
<br>
<br>(C) the manufacturer of such device notifies the Secretary on an annual basis, in a manner prescribed by the Secretary, of the manufacture of such device.
<br>(3) Guidance
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall issue final guidance on replication of multiple devices described in paragraph (2)(B).
<br>(c) Trade secrets
<br>
<br>Any information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Secretary or his representative under section 360c, 360d, 360e, 360f, 360h, 360i, or 374 of this title or under subsection (f) or (g) of this section which is exempt from disclosure pursuant to subsection (a) of section 552 of title 5 by reason of subsection (b)(4) of such section shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed and may not be used by the Secretary as the basis for the reclassification of a device from class III to class II or class I or as the basis for the establishment or amendment of a performance standard under section 360d of this title for a device reclassified from class III to class II, except (1) in accordance with subsection (h), and (2) that such information may be disclosed to other officers or employees concerned with carrying out this chapter or when relevant in any proceeding under this chapter (other than section 360c or 360d of this title).
<br>(d) Notices and findings
<br>
<br>Each notice of proposed rulemaking under section 360c, 360d, 360e, 360f, 360h, or 360i of this title, or under this section, any other notice which is published in the Federal Register with respect to any other action taken under any such section and which states the reasons for such action, and each publication of findings required to be made in connection with rulemaking under any such section shall set forth—
<br>
<br>(1) the manner in which interested persons may examine data and other information on which the notice or findings is based, and
<br>
<br>(2) the period within which interested persons may present their comments on the notice or findings (including the need therefor) orally or in writing, which period shall be at least sixty days but may not exceed ninety days unless the time is extended by the Secretary by a notice published in the Federal Register stating good cause therefor.
<br>(e) Restricted devices
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary may by regulation require that a device be restricted to sale, distribution, or use—
<br>
<br>(A) only upon the written or oral authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to administer or use such device, or
<br>
<br>(B) upon such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in such regulation,
<br>
<br>if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures necessary to its use, the Secretary determines that there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. No condition prescribed under subparagraph (B) may restrict the use of a device to persons with specific training or experience in its use or to persons for use in certain facilities unless the Secretary determines that such a restriction is required for the safe and effective use of the device. No such condition may exclude a person from using a device solely because the person does not have the training or experience to make him eligible for certification by a certifying board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or has not been certified by such a Board. A device subject to a regulation under this subsection is a restricted device.
<br>
<br>(2) The label of a restricted device shall bear such appropriate statements of the restrictions required by a regulation under paragraph (1) as the Secretary may in such regulation prescribe.
<br>(f) Good manufacturing practice requirements
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The Secretary may, in accordance with subparagraph (B), prescribe regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, pre-production design validation (including a process to assess the performance of a device but not including an evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of a device), packing, storage, and installation of a device conform to current good manufacturing practice, as prescribed in such regulations, to assure that the device will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter.
<br>
<br>(B) Before the Secretary may promulgate any regulation under subparagraph (A) he shall—
<br>
<br>(i) afford the advisory committee established under paragraph (3) an opportunity to submit recommendations to him with respect to the regulation proposed to be promulgated;
<br>
<br>(ii) afford opportunity for an oral hearing; and
<br>
<br>(iii) ensure that such regulation conforms, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards defining quality systems, or parts of the standards, for medical devices.
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide the advisory committee a reasonable time to make its recommendation with respect to proposed regulations under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Any person subject to any requirement prescribed by regulations under paragraph (1) may petition the Secretary for an exemption or variance from such requirement. Such a petition shall be submitted to the Secretary in such form and manner as he shall prescribe and shall—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a petition for an exemption from a requirement, set forth the basis for the petitioner's determination that compliance with the requirement is not required to assure that the device will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a petition for a variance from a requirement, set forth the methods proposed to be used in, and the facilities and controls proposed to be used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, and installation of the device in lieu of the methods, facilities, and controls prescribed by the requirement, and
<br>
<br>(iii) contain such other information as the Secretary shall prescribe.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may refer to the advisory committee established under paragraph (3) any petition submitted under subparagraph (A). The advisory committee shall report its recommendations to the Secretary with respect to a petition referred to it within sixty days of the date of the petition's referral. Within sixty days after—
<br>
<br>(i) the date the petition was submitted to the Secretary under subparagraph (A), or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the petition was referred to an advisory committee, the expiration of the sixty-day period beginning on the date the petition was referred to the advisory committee,
<br>
<br>whichever occurs later, the Secretary shall by order either deny the petition or approve it.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary may approve—
<br>
<br>(i) a petition for an exemption for a device from a requirement if he determines that compliance with such requirement is not required to assure that the device will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter, and
<br>
<br>(ii) a petition for a variance for a device from a requirement if he determines that the methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls to be used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, and installation of the device in lieu of the methods, controls, and facilities prescribed by the requirement are sufficient to assure that the device will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter.
<br>
<br>An order of the Secretary approving a petition for a variance shall prescribe such conditions respecting the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, and installation of the device to be granted the variance under the petition as may be necessary to assure that the device will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with this chapter.
