<br>(2) Adjustment for enforcement activities
<br>
<br>The Director may adjust the amounts of any semiannual payments for an assessment under subsection (a) that are to be paid pursuant to subsection (b) by a regulated entity, as necessary in the discretion of the Director, to ensure that the costs of enforcement activities under this Act for a regulated entity are borne only by such regulated entity.

<br>
<br>If at any time, as a result of increased costs of regulation of a regulated entity that is not classified (for purposes of subchapter II) as adequately capitalized or as the result of supervisory or enforcement activities under this Act for a regulated entity, the amount available from any semiannual payment made by such regulated entity pursuant to subsection (b) is insufficient to cover the costs of the Agency with respect to such entity, the Director may make and collect from such regulated entity an immediate assessment to cover the amount of such deficiency for the semiannual period. If, at the end of any semiannual period during which such an assessment is made, any amount remains from such assessment, such remaining amount shall be deducted from the assessment for such regulated entity for the following semiannual period.
<br>(d) Surplus
<br>
<br>Except with respect to amounts collected pursuant to subsection (a)(3), if any amount from any annual assessment collected from an enterprise remains unobligated at the end of the year for which the assessment was collected, such amount shall be credited to the assessment to be collected from the enterprise for the following year.

<br>
<br>At the end of each year for which an assessment under this section is made, the Director shall remit to each regulated entity any amount of assessment collected from such regulated entity that is attributable to subsection (a)(3) and is in excess of the amount the Director deems necessary to maintain a working capital fund.

<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the amounts received by the Director from any assessment under this section shall not be subject to apportionment for the purpose of chapter 15 of title 31 or under any other authority.
<br>(4) Use of funds
<br>
<br>The Director may use any amounts received by the Director from assessments under this section for compensation of the Director and other employees of the Agency and for all other expenses of the Director and the Agency.

<br>
<br>(B) whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the affiliated party is substantially responsible for the insolvency of the regulated entity, the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the regulated entity, or the troubled condition of the regulated entity (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Director);

<br>
<br>(I) the regulated entity became insolvent;
<br>
<br>(II) any conservator or receiver is appointed for such regulated entity; or
<br>
<br>(III) the Director determines that the regulated entity is in a troubled condition (as defined in the regulations of the Director).
<br>(B) Certain payments in contemplation of an event
<br>
<br>Any payment which would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that such payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be treated as a golden parachute payment if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of such subparagraph.

<br>(II) the liquidation, after such date, of the amount of such payment.
<br>(6) Certain commercial insurance coverage not treated as covered benefit payment

<br>§4547. Enterprise guarantee fees
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
<br>(1) Guarantee fee
<br>
<br>The term "guarantee fee"—
<br>
<br>(A) means a fee described in subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(B) includes—
<br>
<br>(i) the guaranty fee charged by the Federal National Mortgage Association with respect to mortgage-backed securities; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the management and guarantee fee charged by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with respect to participation certificates.
<br>(2) Average fees
<br>
<br>The term "average fees" means the average contractual fee rate of single-family guaranty arrangements by an enterprise entered into during 2011, plus the recognition of any up-front cash payments over an estimated average life, expressed in terms of basis points. Such definition shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the annual report on guarantee fees by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
<br>(b) Increase
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Phased increase required
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (c), the Director shall require each enterprise to charge a guarantee fee in connection with any guarantee of the timely payment of principal and interest on securities, notes, and other obligations based on or backed by mortgages on residential real properties designed principally for occupancy of from 1 to 4 families, consummated after December 23, 2011.
<br>(B) Amount
<br>
<br>The amount of the increase required under this section shall be determined by the Director to appropriately reflect the risk of loss, as well 1 the cost of capital allocated to similar assets held by other fully private regulated financial institutions, but such amount shall be not less than an average increase of 10 basis points for each origination year or book year above the average fees imposed in 2011 for such guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from offsetting the cost of the fee to mortgage originators, borrowers, and investors by decreasing other charges, fees, or premiums, or in any other manner.
<br>(2) Authority to limit offer of guarantee
<br>
<br>The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating any offer for a guarantee to a lender for mortgage-backed securities, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the guarantee is inconsistent with the requirements of this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) the risk of loss is allowed to increase, through lowering of the underwriting standards or other means, for the primary purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.
<br>(3) Deposit in Treasury
<br>
<br>Amounts received from fee increases imposed under this section shall be deposited directly into the United States Treasury, and shall be available only to the extent provided in subsequent appropriations Acts. The fees charged pursuant to this section shall not be considered a reimbursement to the Federal Government for the costs or subsidy provided to an enterprise.
<br>(c) Phase-in
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Director may provide for compliance with subsection (b) by allowing each enterprise to increase the guarantee fee charged by the enterprise gradually over the 2-year period beginning on December 23, 2011, in a manner sufficient to comply with this section. In determining a schedule for such increases, the Director shall—
<br>
<br>(A) provide for uniform pricing among lenders;
<br>
<br>(B) provide for adjustments in pricing based on risk levels; and
<br>
<br>(C) take into consideration conditions in financial markets.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to undermine the minimum increase required by subsection (b).
<br>(d) Information collection and annual analysis
<br>
<br>The Director shall require each enterprise to provide to the Director, as part of its annual report submitted to Congress—
<br>
<br>(1) a description of—
<br>
<br>(A) changes made to up-front fees and annual fees as part of the guarantee fees negotiated with lenders;
<br>
<br>(B) changes to the riskiness of the new borrowers compared to previous origination years or book years; and
<br>
<br>(C) any adjustments required to improve for future origination years or book years, in order to be in complete compliance with subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(2) an assessment of how the changes in the guarantee fees described in paragraph (1) met the requirements of subsection (b).
<br>(e) Enforcement
<br>(1) Required adjustments
<br>
<br>Based on the information from subsection (d) and any other information the Director deems necessary, the Director shall require an enterprise to make adjustments in its guarantee fee in order to be in compliance with subsection (b).
<br>(2) Noncompliance penalty
<br>
<br>An enterprise that has been found to be out of compliance with subsection (b) for any 2 consecutive years shall be precluded from providing any guarantee for a period, determined by rule of the Director, but in no case less than 1 year.
<br>(3) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as preventing the Director from initiating and implementing an enforcement action against an enterprise, at a time the Director deems necessary, under other existing enforcement authority.
<br>(f) Expiration
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall expire on October 1, 2021.
