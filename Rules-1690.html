<br>§41106. Reviews of criminal records of applicants for private security officer employment
<br>(a) Short title
<br>
<br>This section may be cited as the "Private Security Officer Employment Authorization Act of 2004".
<br>(b) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) employment of private security officers in the United States is growing rapidly;
<br>
<br>(2) private security officers function as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, public law enforcement by helping to reduce and prevent crime;
<br>
<br>(3) such private security officers protect individuals, property, and proprietary information, and provide protection to such diverse operations as banks, hospitals, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, defense and aerospace contractors, high technology businesses, nuclear power plants, chemical companies, oil and gas refineries, airports, communication facilities and operations, office complexes, schools, residential properties, apartment complexes, gated communities, and others;
<br>
<br>(4) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant services to the citizens of the United States in its public areas, and are supplemented by private security officers;
<br>
<br>(5) the threat of additional terrorist attacks requires cooperation between public and private sectors and demands professional, reliable, and responsible security officers for the protection of people, facilities, and institutions;
<br>
<br>(6) the trend in the Nation toward growth in such security services has accelerated rapidly;
<br>
<br>(7) such growth makes available more public sector law enforcement officers to combat serious and violent crimes, including terrorism;
<br>
<br>(8) the American public deserves the employment of qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an adjunct to sworn law enforcement officers; and
<br>
<br>(9) private security officers and applicants for private security officer positions should be thoroughly screened and trained.
