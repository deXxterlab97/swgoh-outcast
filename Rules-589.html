<br>§1666a. Regulation of credit reports
<br>(a) Reports by creditor on obligor's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error
<br>
<br>After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666(a) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666(a)(2) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days (not less than ten) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.
<br>(b) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency
<br>
<br>If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection (a) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666(a)(2) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency.
<br>(c) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts
<br>
<br>A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection (b) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported.

<br>§1666b. Timing of payments
<br>(a) Time to make payments
<br>
<br>A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637(b) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.
<br>(b) Grace period
<br>
<br>If an open end consumer credit plan provides a time period within which an obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring an additional finance charge, such additional finance charge may not be imposed with respect to such portion of the credit extended for the billing cycle of which such period is a part, unless a statement which includes the amount upon which the finance charge for the period is based was mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the date specified in the statement by which payment must be made in order to avoid imposition of that finance charge.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title I, §163, as added Pub. L. 93–495, title III, §306, Oct. 28, 1974, 88 Stat. 1514; amended Pub. L. 111–24, title I, §106(b)(1), May 22, 2009, 123 Stat. 1742; Pub. L. 111–93, §2, Nov. 6, 2009, 123 Stat. 2998.)

<br>§1666c. Prompt and fair crediting of payments
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Payments received from an obligor under an open end consumer credit plan by the creditor shall be posted promptly to the obligor's account as specified in regulations of the Bureau. Such regulations shall prevent a finance charge from being imposed on any obligor if the creditor has received the obligor's payment in readily identifiable form, by 5:00 p.m. on the date on which such payment is due, in the amount, manner, and location indicated by the creditor to avoid the imposition thereof.
<br>(b) Application of payments
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of a payment from a cardholder, the card issuer shall apply amounts in excess of the minimum payment amount first to the card balance bearing the highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the payment is exhausted.
<br>(2) Clarification relating to certain deferred interest arrangements
<br>
<br>A creditor shall allocate the entire amount paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum payment amount to a balance on which interest is deferred during the last 2 billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of the period during which interest is deferred.
<br>(c) Changes by card issuer
<br>
<br>If a card issuer makes a material change in the mailing address, office, or procedures for handling cardholder payments, and such change causes a material delay in the crediting of a cardholder payment made during the 60-day period following the date on which such change took effect, the card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the credit card account to which such payment was credited.

<br>§1666i. Assertion by cardholder against card issuer of claims and defenses arising out of credit card transaction; prerequisites; limitation on amount of claims or defenses
<br>(a) Claims and defenses assertible
<br>
<br>Subject to the limitation contained in subsection (b), a card issuer who has issued a credit card to a cardholder pursuant to an open end consumer credit plan shall be subject to all claims (other than tort claims) and defenses arising out of any transaction in which the credit card is used as a method of payment or extension of credit if (1) the obligor has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a disagreement or problem relative to the transaction from the person honoring the credit card; (2) the amount of the initial transaction exceeds $50; and (3) the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same State as the mailing address previously provided by the cardholder or was within 100 miles from such address, except that the limitations set forth in clauses (2) and (3) with respect to an obligor's right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer shall not be applicable to any transaction in which the person honoring the credit card (A) is the same person as the card issuer, (B) is controlled by the card issuer, (C) is under direct or indirect common control with the card issuer, (D) is a franchised dealer in the card issuer's products or services, or (E) has obtained the order for such transaction through a mail solicitation made by or participated in by the card issuer in which the cardholder is solicited to enter into such transaction by using the credit card issued by the card issuer.
<br>(b) Amount of claims and defenses assertible
<br>
<br>The amount of claims or defenses asserted by the cardholder may not exceed the amount of credit outstanding with respect to such transaction at the time the cardholder first notifies the card issuer or the person honoring the credit card of such claim or defense. For the purpose of determining the amount of credit outstanding in the preceding sentence, payments and credits to the cardholder's account are deemed to have been applied, in the order indicated, to the payment of: (1) late charges in the order of their entry to the account; (2) finance charges in order of their entry to the account; and (3) debits to the account other than those set forth above, in the order in which each debit entry to the account was made.

<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The prohibition under subsection (a) shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(1) an increase in an annual percentage rate upon the expiration of a specified period of time, provided that—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) the increased annual percentage rate does not exceed the rate disclosed pursuant to subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(C) the increased annual percentage rate is not applied to transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the period;
<br>
<br>(2) an increase in a variable annual percentage rate in accordance with a credit card agreement that provides for changes in the rate according to operation of an index that is not under the control of the creditor and is available to the general public;
<br>
<br>(3) an increase due to the completion of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement by the obligor or the failure of the obligor to comply with the terms of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement, provided that—
<br>
<br>(A) the annual percentage rate, fee, or finance charge applicable to a category of transactions following any such increase does not exceed the rate, fee, or finance charge that applied to that category of transactions prior to commencement of the arrangement; and
<br>
<br>(B) the creditor has provided the obligor, prior to the commencement of such arrangement, with clear and conspicuous disclosure of the terms of the arrangement (including any increases due to such completion or failure); or
<br>
<br>(4) an increase due solely to the fact that a minimum payment by the obligor has not been received by the creditor within 60 days after the due date for such payment, provided that the creditor shall—
<br>
<br>(A) include, together with the notice of such increase required under section 1637(i) of this title, a clear and conspicuous written statement of the reason for the increase and that the increase will terminate not later than 6 months after the date on which it is imposed, if the creditor receives the required minimum payments on time from the obligor during that period; and

<br>
<br>The creditor shall not change the terms governing the repayment of any outstanding balance, except that the creditor may provide the obligor with one of the methods described in paragraph (2) of repaying any outstanding balance, or a method that is no less beneficial to the obligor than one of those methods.
<br>(2) Methods
<br>
<br>The methods described in this paragraph are—
<br>
<br>(A) an amortization period of not less than 5 years, beginning on the effective date of the increase set forth in the notice required under section 1637(i) of this title; or

<br>
<br>(5) A statement of the amount or method of determining the amount of any liabilities the lease imposes upon the lessee at the end of the term and whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase the leased property and at what price and time;

<br>
<br>(7) A brief description of insurance provided or paid for by the lessor or required of the lessee, including the types and amounts of the coverages and costs;

<br>§1667b. Lessee's liability on expiration or termination of lease
<br>(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment
<br>
<br>Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.
<br>(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination
<br>
<br>Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.
<br>(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality
<br>
<br>If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title I, §183, as added Pub. L. 94–240, §3, Mar. 23, 1976, 90 Stat. 259.)

<br>(a) In general

<br>(1) the transaction advertised is a lease;
<br>
<br>(2) the total amount of any initial payments required on or before consummation of the lease or delivery of the property, whichever is later;
<br>

<br>
<br>(4) the number, amount, and timing of scheduled payments; and
<br>

<br>
<br>No owner or employee of any entity that serves as a medium in which an advertisement appears or through which an advertisement is disseminated, shall be liable under this section.
<br>(c) Radio advertisements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>An advertisement by radio broadcast to aid, promote, or assist, directly or indirectly, any consumer lease shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) if such advertisement clearly and conspicuously—
<br>
<br>(A) states the information required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(B) states the number, amounts, due dates or periods of scheduled payments, and the total of such payments under the lease;
<br>
<br>(C) includes—
<br>
<br>(i) a referral to—
<br>
<br>(I) a toll-free telephone number established in accordance with paragraph (2) that may be used by consumers to obtain the information required under subsection (a); or
<br>
<br>(II) a written advertisement that—
<br>
<br>(aa) appears in a publication in general circulation in the community served by the radio station on which such advertisement is broadcast during the period beginning 3 days before any such broadcast and ending 10 days after such broadcast; and

<br>
<br>(ii) maintain such telephone number for a period of not less than 10 days, beginning on the date of any such broadcast; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide the information required under subsection (a) with respect to the lease to any person who calls such number.
<br>(B) Form of information
<br>
<br>The information required to be provided under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be provided verbally or, if requested by the consumer, in written form.
<br>(3) No effect on other law
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall affect the requirements of Federal law as such requirements apply to advertisement by any medium other than radio broadcast.

<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Section 2605(b)(2) of div. A of Pub. L. 104–208 provided that:
<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—Any regulation of the Board, or any amendment or interpretation of any regulation of the Board issued pursuant to section 187 of the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1667f] (as added by paragraph (1) of this subsection), shall become effective on the first October 1 that follows the date of promulgation of that regulation, amendment, or interpretation by not less than 6 months.
<br>
<br>"(B) Longer period.—The Board may, at the discretion of the Board, extend the time period referred to in subparagraph (A) in accordance with subparagraph (C), to permit lessors to adjust their disclosure forms to accommodate the requirements of section 127 [187] of the Truth in Lending Act (as added by paragraph (1) of this subsection).
<br>
<br>"(C) Shorter period.—The Board may shorten the time period referred to in subparagraph (A), if the Board makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent an unfair or deceptive practice.
<br>
<br>"(D) Compliance before effective date.—Any lessor may comply with any means of disclosure provided for in section 127 [187] of the Truth in Lending Act (as added by paragraph (1) of this subsection) before the effective date of such requirement.

<br>"(E) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection, the term 'lessor' has the same meaning as in section 181 of the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1667]."
<br>Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes
<br>
<br>Section 2605(a) of div. A of Pub. L. 104–208 provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(A) competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the business of consumer leasing is greatest when there is informed use of leasing;
<br>
<br>"(B) the informed use of leasing results from an awareness of the cost of leasing by consumers; and
<br>
<br>"(C) there has been a continued trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that leasing product advances have occurred such that lessors have been unable to provide consistent industry-wide disclosures to fully account for the competitive progress that has occurred.
<br>
<br>"(2) Purposes.—The purposes of this section are—
<br>
<br>"(A) to assure a simple, meaningful disclosure of leasing terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various leasing terms available to the consumer and avoid the uninformed use of leasing, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair leasing practices;
<br>

<br>
<br>"(ii) enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements."

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—RESTRICTIONS ON GARNISHMENT
<br>§1671. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Disadvantages of garnishment
<br>
<br>The Congress finds:
<br>
<br>(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for personal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors' remedy frequently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the resulting disruption of employment, production, and consumption constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>(3) The great disparities among the laws of the several States relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many areas of the country.
<br>(b) Necessity for regulation
<br>
<br>On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of this subchapter are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bankruptcy laws.
<br>

<br>§1672. Definitions
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this subchapter:
<br>
<br>(a) The term "earnings" means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program.
<br>
<br>(b) The term "disposable earnings" means that part of the earnings of any individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.
<br>
<br>(c) The term "garnishment" means any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of any individual are required to be withheld for payment of any debt.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title III, §302, May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 163.)
<br>§1673. Restriction on garnishment
<br>(a) Maximum allowable garnishment
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section 1675 of this title, the maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subjected to garnishment may not exceed
<br>
<br>(1) 25 per centum of his disposable earnings for that week, or
<br>
<br>(2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that week exceed thirty times the Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 206(a)(1) of title 29 in effect at the time the earnings are payable,
<br>
<br>whichever is less. In the case of earnings for any pay period other than a week, the Secretary of Labor shall by regulation prescribe a multiple of the Federal minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set forth in paragraph (2).
<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>(1) The restrictions of subsection (a) do not apply in the case of
<br>
<br>(A) any order for the support of any person issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or in accordance with an administrative procedure, which is established by State law, which affords substantial due process, and which is subject to judicial review.
<br>
<br>(B) any order of any court of the United States having jurisdiction over cases under chapter 13 of title 11.
<br>
<br>(C) any debt due for any State or Federal tax.
<br>
<br>(2) The maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subject to garnishment to enforce any order for the support of any person shall not exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) where such individual is supporting his spouse or dependent child (other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support such order is used), 50 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week; and
<br>
<br>(B) where such individual is not supporting such a spouse or dependent child described in clause (A), 60 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week;
<br>
<br>except that, with respect to the disposable earnings of any individual for any workweek, the 50 per centum specified in clause (A) shall be deemed to be 55 per centum and the 60 per centum specified in clause (B) shall be deemed to be 65 per centum, if and to the extent that such earnings are subject to garnishment to enforce a support order with respect to a period which is prior to the twelve-week period which ends with the beginning of such workweek.
<br>(c) Execution or enforcement of garnishment order or process prohibited
<br>
<br>No court of the United States or any State, and no State (or officer or agency thereof), may make, execute, or enforce any order or process in violation of this section.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II–A—CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS
<br>§1679. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.
<br>
<br>(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this subchapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and
<br>
<br>(2) to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.

<br>§1679c. Disclosures
<br>(a) Disclosure required
<br>
<br>Any credit repair organization shall provide any consumer with the following written statement before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed:
<br>"Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law
<br>
<br>"You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any 'credit repair' company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.
<br>
<br>"You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.
<br>
<br>"You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.
<br>
<br>"You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.
<br>
<br>"Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.
<br>
<br>"You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.
<br>
<br>"If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.
<br>

<br>"Federal Trade Commission
<br>"Washington, D.C. 20580".
<br>(b) Separate statement requirement
<br>
<br>The written statement required under this section shall be provided as a document which is separate from any written contract or other agreement between the credit repair organization and the consumer or any other written material provided to the consumer.
<br>(c) Retention of compliance records
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The credit repair organization shall maintain a copy of the statement signed by the consumer acknowledging receipt of the statement.
<br>(2) Maintenance for 2 years
<br>
<br>The copy of any consumer's statement shall be maintained in the organization's files for 2 years after the date on which the statement is signed by the consumer.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES
<br>§1681. Congressional findings and statement of purpose
<br>(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.
<br>
<br>(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.
<br>
<br>(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.
<br>
<br>(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.
