<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), whenever a flammability standard or other regulation for a fabric, related material, or product is in effect under this chapter, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect a flammability standard or other regulation for such fabric, related material, or product if the standard or other regulation is designed to protect against the same risk of occurrence of fire with respect to which the standard or other regulation under this chapter is in effect unless the State or political subdivision standard or other regulation is identical to the Federal standard or other regulation.
<br>(b) State standards or regulations which afford a higher degree of protection
<br>
<br>The Federal Government and the government of any State or political subdivision of a State may establish and continue in effect a flammability standard or other regulation applicable to a fabric, related material, or product for its own use which standard or other regulation is designed to protect against a risk of occurrence of fire with respect to which a flammability standard or other regulation is in effect under this chapter and which is not identical to such standard or other regulation if the Federal, State, or political subdivision standard or other regulation provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of occurrence of fire than the standard or other regulation in effect under this chapter.
<br>(c) Exemption for State standards or regulations; requirements; determination of burden on interstate commerce; notice and hearing
<br>
<br>(1) Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission may, by regulation promulgated in accordance with paragraph (2), exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, any flammability standard or other regulation of such State or political subdivision applicable to a fabric, related material, or product subject to a standard or other regulation in effect under this chapter, if—
<br>
<br>(A) compliance with the State or political subdivision requirement would not cause the fabric, related material, or product to be in violation of the standard or other regulation in effect under this chapter, and
<br>
<br>(B) the State or political subdivision standard or other regulation (i) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from the risk of occurrence of fire with respect to which the Federal standard or other regulation is in effect, and (ii) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision flammability standard or other regulation on interstate commerce the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such flammability standard or other regulation, the cost of complying with such flammability standard or other regulation, the geographic distribution of the fabric, related material, or product to which the flammability standard or other regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar flammability standard or other regulation, and the need for a national, uniform flammability standard or other regulation under this chapter for such fabric, related material, or product.
<br>
<br>(2) A regulation under paragraph (1) granting an exemption for a flammability standard or other regulation of a State or political subdivision of a State may be promulgated by the Commission only after it has provided, in accordance with section 553(b) of title 5, notice with respect to the promulgation of the regulation and has provided opportunity for the oral presentation of views respecting its promulgation.
<br>(d) Flammability standards or regulations

<br>(q)(1) The term "banned hazardous substance" means (A) any toy, or other article intended for use by children, which is a hazardous substance, or which bears or contains a hazardous substance in such manner as to be susceptible of access by a child to whom such toy or other article is entrusted; or (B) any hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household, which the Commission by regulation classifies as a "banned hazardous substance" on the basis of a finding that, notwithstanding such cautionary labeling as is or may be required under this chapter for that substance, the degree or nature of the hazard involved in the presence or use of such substance in households is such that the objective of the protection of the public health and safety can be adequately served only by keeping such substance, when so intended or packaged, out of the channels of interstate commerce: Provided, That the Commission, by regulation, (i) shall exempt from clause (A) of this paragraph articles, such as chemical sets, which by reason of their functional purpose require the inclusion of the hazardous substance involved or necessarily present an electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazard, and which bear labeling giving adequate directions and warnings for safe use and are intended for use by children who have attained sufficient maturity, and may reasonably be expected, to read and heed such directions and warnings, and (ii) shall exempt from clause (A), and provide for the labeling of, common fireworks (including toy paper caps, cone fountains, cylinder fountains, whistles without report, and sparklers) to the extent that it determines that such articles can be adequately labeled to protect the purchasers and users thereof.
<br>
<br>(2) Proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations pursuant to clause (B) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (f) through (i) of section 1262 of this title, except that if the Commission finds that the distribution for household use of the hazardous substance involved presents an imminent hazard to the public health, it may by order published in the Federal Register give notice of such finding, and thereupon such substance when intended or offered for household use, or when so packaged as to be suitable for such use, shall be deemed to be a "banned hazardous substance" pending the completion of proceedings relating to the issuance of such regulations.
<br>
<br>(r) An article may be determined to present an electrical hazard if, in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, its design or manufacture may cause personal injury or illness by electric shock.
<br>
<br>(s) An article may be determined to present a mechanical hazard if, in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, its design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness (1) from fracture, fragmentation, or disassembly of the article, (2) from propulsion of the article (or any part or accessory thereof), (3) from points or other protrusions, surfaces, edges, openings, or closures, (4) from moving parts, (5) from lack or insufficiency of controls to reduce or stop motion, (6) as a result of self-adhering characteristics of the article, (7) because the article (or any part or accessory thereof) may be aspirated or ingested, (8) because of instability, or (9) because of any other aspect of the article's design or manufacture.
<br>
<br>(t) An article may be determined to present a thermal hazard if, in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, its design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness because of heat as from heated parts, substances, or surfaces.

<br>
<br>"(b)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if a hazardous substance or its packaging is subject to a cautionary labeling requirement under section 2(p) or 3(b) [subsec. (p) of this section or section 1262(b) of this title] designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with the substance, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect a cautionary labeling requirement applicable to such substance or packaging and designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury unless such cautionary labeling requirement is identical to the labeling requirement under section 2(p) or 3(b) [subsec. (p) of this section or section 1262(b) of this title].
<br>
<br>"(B) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), if under regulations of the Commission promulgated under or for the enforcement of section 2(q) [subsec. (q) of this section] a requirement is established to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with a hazardous substance, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect a requirement applicable to such substance and designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury unless such requirement is identical to the requirement established under such regulations.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Federal Government and the government of any State or political subdivision of a State may establish and continue in effect a requirement applicable to a hazardous substance for its own use (or to the packaging of such a substance) which requirement is designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with such substance and which is not identical to a requirement described in paragraph (1) applicable to such substance (or packaging) and designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury if the Federal, State, or political subdivision requirement provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of illness or injury than the requirement described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>"(3)(A) Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission may, by regulation promulgated in accordance with subparagraph (B), exempt from paragraph (1), under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, any requirement of such State or political subdivision designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with a hazardous substance if—
<br>
<br>"(i) compliance with the requirement would not cause the hazardous substance (or its packaging) to be in violation of the applicable requirement described in paragraph (1), and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the State or political subdivision requirement (I) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of illness or injury than the requirement described in paragraph (1), and (II) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision requirement on interstate commerce the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such requirement, the cost of complying with such requirement, the geographic distribution of the substance to which the requirement would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this paragraph for a similar requirement, and the need for a national, uniform requirement under this Act [this chapter] for such substance (or its packaging).
<br>
<br>"(B) A regulation under subparagraph (A) granting an exemption for a requirement of a State or political subdivision of a State may be promulgated by the Commission only after it has provided, in accordance with section 553(b) of title 5, United States Code, notice with respect to the promulgation of the regulation and has provided opportunity for the oral presentation of views respecting its promulgation.
<br>
<br>"(4) Paragraph (1)(B) does not prohibit a State or a political subdivision of a State from establishing or continuing in effect a requirement which is designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with fireworks devices or components thereof and which provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of illness or injury than a requirement in effect under a regulation of the Commission described in such paragraph."

<br>§1262. Declaration of hazardous substances
<br>(a) Rulemaking
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the objectives of this chapter by avoiding or resolving uncertainty as to its application, the Commission may by regulation declare to be a hazardous substance, for the purposes of this chapter, any substance or mixture of substances, which it finds meets the requirements of section 1261(f)(1)(A) of this title.
<br>(2) Procedure
<br>
<br>Proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations under this subsection and the admissibility of the record of such proceedings in other proceedings, shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (f) through (i) of this section.
<br>(b) Reasonable variations or additional label requirements
<br>
<br>If the Commission finds that the requirements of section 1261(p)(1) of this title are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety in view of the special hazard presented by any particular hazardous substance, it may by regulation establish such reasonable variations or additional label requirements as it finds necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children, which fails to bear a label in accordance with such regulations shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance.
<br>(c) Exemption from requirements by regulation
<br>
<br>If the Commission finds that, because of the size of the package involved or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance contained therein, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with the labeling requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety, the Commission shall promulgate regulations exempting such substance from these requirements to the extent it determines to be consistent with adequate protection of the public health and safety.
<br>(d) Exemption from requirements of this chapter of substances or containers adequately regulated by other provisions of law
<br>
<br>The Commission may exempt from the requirements established by or pursuant to this chapter any hazardous substance or container of a hazardous substance with respect to which it finds that adequate requirements satisfying the purposes of this chapter have been established by or pursuant to any other Act of Congress.
<br>(e) Regulation of toys or articles intended for use by children
<br>
<br>(1) A determination by the Commission that a toy or other article intended for use by children presents an electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazard shall be made by regulation in accordance with the procedures prescribed by section 553 (other than clause (B) of the last sentence of subsection (b) of such section) of title 5 unless the Commission elects the procedures prescribed by subsection (e) of section 371 of title 21, in which event such subsection and subsections (f) and (g) of such section 371 of title 21 shall apply to the making of such determination. If the Commission makes such election, it shall publish that fact with the proposal required to be published under paragraph (1) of such subsection (e).
<br>
<br>(2) If, before or during a proceeding pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission finds that, because of an electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazard, distribution of the toy or other article involved presents an imminent hazard to the public health and it, by order published in the Federal Register, gives notice of such finding, such toy or other article shall be deemed to be a banned hazardous substance for purposes of this chapter until the proceeding has been completed. If not yet initiated when such order is published, such a proceeding shall be initiated as promptly as possible.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) In the case of any toy or other article intended for use by children which is determined by the Commission, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, to present an electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazard, any person who will be adversely affected by such a determination may, at any time prior to the 60th day after the regulation making such determination is issued by the Commission, file a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such person resides or has his principal place of business for a judicial review of such determination. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other officer designated by him 1 for that purpose. The Commission shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Commission based its determination, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.
<br>
<br>(B) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there was no opportunity to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before the Commission in a hearing or in such other manner, and upon such terms and conditions, as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original determination, with the return of such additional evidence.
<br>
<br>(C) Upon the filing of the petition under this paragraph, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the determination of the Commission in accordance with subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (2) of the second sentence of section 706 of title 5. If the court ordered additional evidence to be taken under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the court shall also review the Secretary's 2 determination to determine if, on the basis of the entire record before the court pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, it is supported by substantial evidence. If the court finds the determination is not so supported, the court may set it aside. With respect to any determination reviewed under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief pending conclusion of the review proceedings, as provided in section 705 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(D) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such determination of the Commission shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
<br>(f) Commencement of proceeding for promulgation of regulation; notice
<br>
<br>A proceeding for the promulgation of a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title classifying an article or substance as a banned hazardous substance or a regulation under subsection (e) of this section may be commenced by the publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which shall—
<br>
<br>(1) identify the article or substance and the nature of the risk of injury associated with the article or substance;
<br>
<br>(2) include a summary of each of the regulatory alternatives under consideration by the Commission (including voluntary standards);
<br>
<br>(3) include information with respect to any existing standard known to the Commission which may be relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such standard does not eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of publication of the notice), comments with respect to the risk of injury identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the risk;
<br>
<br>(5) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), an existing standard or a portion of a standard as a proposed regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title or subsection (e) of this section; and
<br>
<br>(6) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary standard to address the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1) together with a description of a plan to modify or develop the standard.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.
<br>(g) Publication of standard; termination of proceeding for promulgation of regulation; monitoring of compliance
<br>
<br>(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (f)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title or subsection (e) of this section, as the case may be, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in a notice provided under subsection (f)(1), the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed regulation under such section or subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Commission determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (f)(6) is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and
<br>
<br>(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,
<br>
<br>the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title or subsection (e) of this section, respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards—
<br>
<br>(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (2) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or
<br>
<br>(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.
<br>(h) Publication of proposed rule together with preliminary regulatory analysis
<br>
<br>No regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title classifying an article or substance as a banned hazardous substance and no regulation under subsection (e) of this section may be proposed by the Commission unless the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing—
<br>
<br>(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed regulation, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;
<br>
<br>(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (f)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed regulation or part of the proposed regulation;
<br>
<br>(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (f)(6) and assisted by the Commission as required by section 2054(a)(3) of this title would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in the notice provided under subsection (f)(1); and
<br>
<br>(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed regulation, together with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed regulation.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any person from submitting an existing standard or portion of a standard as a proposed regulation.
<br>(i) Publication of final regulatory analysis with regulation; required findings; judicial review
<br>
<br>(1) The Commission shall not promulgate a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title classifying an article or substance as a banned hazardous substance or a regulation under subsection (e) of this section unless it has prepared a final regulatory analysis of the regulation containing the following information:
<br>
<br>(A) A description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the regulation, including costs and benefits that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs.
<br>
<br>(B) A description of any alternatives to the final regulation which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.
<br>
<br>(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the regulation.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title classifying an article or substance as a banned hazardous substance or a regulation under subsection (e) of this section unless it finds (and includes such finding in the regulation)—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a regulation which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such regulation have adopted and implemented a voluntary standard, that—
<br>
<br>(i) compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or
<br>
<br>(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard;
<br>
<br>(B) that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and
<br>
<br>(C) that the regulation imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the regulation is being promulgated.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Any regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (h) or paragraph (1) shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a regulation is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.
<br>
<br>(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.
<br>(j) Petition to initiate rulemaking
<br>
<br>The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under section 553(e) of title 5 requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.

<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>No person shall be subject to the penalties of subsection (a) of this section, (1) for having violated section 1263(c) of this title, if the receipt, delivery, or proffered delivery of the hazardous substance was made in good faith, unless he refuses to furnish on request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Commission, the name and address of the person from whom he purchased or received such hazardous substance, and copies of all documents, if any there be, pertaining to the delivery of the hazardous substance to him; or (2) for having violated section 1263(a) of this title, if he established a guarantee or undertaking signed by, and containing the name and address of, the person residing in the United States from whom he received in good faith the hazardous substance, to the effect that the hazardous substance is not a misbranded hazardous substance or a banned hazardous substance within the meaning of those terms in this chapter; or (3) for having violated subsection (a) or (c) of section 1263 of this title with respect to any hazardous substance shipped or delivered for shipment for export to any foreign country, in a package marked for export on the outside of the shipping container and labeled in accordance with the specifications of the foreign purchaser and in accordance with the laws of the foreign country, but if such hazardous substance is sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce or if the Commission determines that exportation of such substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to persons residing within the United States, this clause shall not apply.
<br>(c) Civil penalties
<br>
<br>(1) Any person who knowingly violates section 1263 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100,000 for each such violation. Subject to paragraph (2), a violation of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (i), (j), and (k) of section 1263 of this title shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each substance involved, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations. A violation of section 1263(e) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each failure or refusal to allow or perform an act required by section 1263(e) of this title; and, if such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations.
<br>
<br>(2) The second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to violations of subsection (a) or (c) of section 1263 of this title—
<br>
<br>(A) if the person who violated such subsection is not the manufacturer, importer, or private labeler or a distributor of the substances involved; and
<br>
<br>(B) if such person did not have either (i) actual knowledge that such person's distribution or sale of the substance violated such subsection, or (ii) notice from the Commission that such distribution or sale would be a violation of such subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) In determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of section 1263 of this title, the Commission shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including the nature of the substance, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, the amount of the substance distributed, the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, and such other factors as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(4) Any civil penalty under this subsection may be compromised by the Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or whether it should be remitted or mitigated, and in what amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the persons charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including,1 the nature of the substance involved, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, and the amount of the substance distributed, and such other factors as appropriate. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.
<br>
<br>(5) As used in the first sentence of paragraph (1), the term "knowingly" means (A) having actual knowledge, or (B) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable person who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care to ascertain the truth of representations.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(B) Not later than December 1, 2011, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately following such publication.
<br>
<br>(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded to—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000;
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;
