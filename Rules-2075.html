<br>
<br>Pub. L. 98–89, §1, Aug. 26, 1983, 97 Stat. 500, provided in part that: "Certain general and permanent laws of the United States, related to vessels and seamen, are revised, consolidated, and enacted as title 46, United States Code, 'Shipping' ".
<br>Legislative Purpose and Construction
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–304, §2, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1485, provided that:

<br>
<br>"(b) Conformity With Original Intent.—In the codification of laws by this Act, the intent is to conform to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of the Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, in accordance with section 205(c)(1) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93–554 (2 U.S.C. 285b(1))."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–304, §18, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1709, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Cutoff Date.—This Act [see Tables for classification] replaces certain provisions enacted on or before April 30, 2005. If a law enacted after that date amends or repeals a provision replaced by this Act, that law is deemed to amend or repeal, as the case may be, the corresponding provision enacted by this Act. If a law enacted after that date is otherwise inconsistent with this Act, it supersedes this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.
<br>
<br>"(b) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged.—For purposes of determining whether one provision supersedes another based on enactment later in time, the date of enactment of a provision enacted by this Act is deemed to be the date of enactment of the provision it replaced.

<br>"(c) References to Provisions Replaced.—A reference to a provision replaced by this Act is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(d) Laws Governing Applicability of Prior Amendments.—This Act does not affect any law governing the applicability of an amendment to a provision replaced by this Act, notwithstanding the repeal by this Act of the provision that was amended. To the extent that any such law governed the applicability of a provision replaced by this Act, that law governs the applicability of the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(e) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative Actions.—A regulation, order, or other administrative action in effect under a provision replaced by this Act continues in effect under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.

<br>"(c) An action taken or an offense committed under a law replaced by section 102 of this Act is deemed to have been taken or committed under the corresponding provision of this Act.
<br>
<br>"(d) An inference of legislative construction is not to be drawn by reason of the caption or catch line of a provision enacted by section 102 of this Act.
<br>
<br>"(e) If a provision of this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect. If a provision of this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications."

<br>
<br>"(c) An order, rule, or regulation in effect under a law replaced by this subtitle continues in effect under the corresponding provision of this subtitle until repealed, amended, or superseded.
