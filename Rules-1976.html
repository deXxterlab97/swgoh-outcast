<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–84, §2, Dec. 18, 2001, 115 Stat. 823, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Of the childhood muscular dystrophies, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the world's most common and catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease, and is characterized by a rapidly progressive muscle weakness that almost always results in death, usually by 20 years of age.
<br>
<br>"(2) Duchenne muscular dystrophy is genetically inherited, and mothers are the carriers in approximately 70 percent of all cases.
<br>
<br>"(3) If a female is a carrier of the dystrophin gene, there is a 50 percent chance per birth that her male offspring will have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and a 50 percent chance per birth that her female offspring will be carriers.
<br>
<br>"(4) Duchenne is the most common lethal genetic disorder of childhood worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 boys worldwide.
<br>
<br>"(5) Children with muscular dystrophy exhibit extreme symptoms of weakness, delay in walking, waddling gait, difficulty in climbing stairs, and progressive mobility problems often in combination with muscle hypertrophy.
<br>
<br>"(6) Other forms of muscular dystrophy affecting children and adults include Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies.
<br>
<br>"(7) Myotonic muscular dystrophy (also known as Steinert's disease and dystrophia myotonica) is the second most prominent form of muscular dystrophy and the type most commonly found in adults. Unlike any of the other muscular dystrophies, the muscle weakness is accompanied by myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) and by a variety of abnormalities in addition to those of muscle.
<br>
<br>"(8) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (referred to in this section as 'FSHD') is a neuromuscular disorder that is inherited genetically and has an estimated frequency of 1 in 20,000. FSHD, affecting between 15,000 to 40,000 persons, causes a progressive and sever [sic] loss of skeletal muscle gradually bringing weakness and reduced mobility. Many persons with FSHD become severely physically disabled and spend many decades in a wheelchair.
<br>
<br>"(9) FSHD is regarded as a novel genetic phenomenon resulting from a crossover of subtelomeric DNA and may be the only human disease caused by a deletion-mutation.
<br>
<br>"(10) Each of the muscular dystrophies, though distinct in progressivity and severity of symptoms, have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of children and adults throughout the United States and worldwide and impose severe physical and economic burdens on those affected.
<br>
<br>"(11) Muscular dystrophies have a significant impact on quality of life—not only for the individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting disability, but also for family members and caregivers.
<br>
<br>"(12) Development of therapies for these disorders, while realistic with recent advances in research, is likely to require costly investments and infrastructure to support gene and other therapies.
<br>
<br>"(13) There is a shortage of qualified researchers in the field of neuromuscular research.
<br>
<br>"(14) Many family physicians and health care professionals lack the knowledge and resources to detect and properly diagnose the disease as early as possible, thus exacerbating the progressiveness of symptoms in cases that go undetected or misdiagnosed.
<br>
<br>"(15) There is a need for efficient mechanisms to translate clinically relevant findings in muscular dystrophy research from basic science to applied work.
<br>
<br>"(16) Educating the public and health care community throughout the country about this devastating disease is of paramount importance and is in every respect in the public interest and to the benefit of all communities."

<br>§247b–21. Mosquito-borne diseases; coordination grants to States; assessment and control grants to political subdivisions
<br>(a) Coordination grants to States; assessment grants to political subdivisions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to mosquito control programs to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases (referred to in this section as "control programs"), the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to States for the purpose of—
<br>
<br>(A) coordinating control programs in the State involved; and
<br>
<br>(B) assisting such State in making grants to political subdivisions of the State to conduct assessments to determine the immediate needs in such subdivisions for control programs, including programs to address emerging infectious mosquito-borne diseases, and to develop, on the basis of such assessments, plans for carrying out control programs in the subdivisions or improving existing control programs.
<br>(2) Preference in making grants
<br>
<br>In making grants under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to States that have one or more political subdivisions with an incidence, prevalence, or high risk of mosquito-borne disease, or a population of infected mosquitoes, that is substantial relative to political subdivisions in other States.
<br>(3) Certain requirements
<br>
<br>A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the State involved has developed, or agrees to develop, a plan for coordinating control programs in the State, and the plan takes into account any assessments or plans described in subsection (b)(3) that have been conducted or developed, respectively, by political subdivisions in the State;
<br>
<br>(B) in developing such plan, the State consulted or will consult (as the case may be under subparagraph (A)) with political subdivisions in the State that are carrying out or planning to carry out control programs;
<br>
<br>(C) the State agrees to monitor control programs in the State in order to ensure that the programs are carried out in accordance with such plan, with priority given to coordination of control programs in political subdivisions described in paragraph (2) that are contiguous;
<br>
<br>(D) the State agrees that the State will make grants to political subdivisions as described in paragraph (1)(B), and that such a grant will not exceed $10,000; and
<br>
<br>(E) the State agrees that the grant will be used to supplement, and not supplant, State and local funds available for the purpose described in paragraph (1).
<br>(4) Reports to Secretary
<br>
<br>A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the State involved agrees that, promptly after the end of the fiscal year for which the grant is made, the State will submit to the Secretary a report that—
<br>
<br>(A) describes the activities of the State under the grant; and
<br>
<br>(B) contains an evaluation of whether the control programs of political subdivisions in the State were effectively coordinated with each other, which evaluation takes into account any reports that the State received under subsection (b)(5) from such subdivisions.
<br>(5) Number of grants
<br>
<br>A State may not receive more than one grant under paragraph (1).
<br>(b) Prevention and control grants to political subdivisions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to political subdivisions of States or consortia of political subdivisions of States, for the operation, including improvement, of control programs.
<br>(2) Preference in making grants
<br>
<br>In making grants under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions that—
<br>
<br>(A) has—
<br>
<br>(i) a history of elevated incidence or prevalence of mosquito-borne disease;
<br>
<br>(ii) a population of infected mosquitoes;
<br>
<br>(iii) met criteria determined by the Secretary to suggest an increased risk of elevated incidence or prevalence of mosquito-borne disease in the pending fiscal year, including an emerging infectious mosquito-borne disease that presents a serious public health threat; or
<br>
<br>(iv) a public health emergency due to the incidence or prevalence of a mosquito-borne disease that presents a serious public health threat;
<br>
<br>(B) demonstrates to the Secretary that such political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions will, if appropriate to the mosquito circumstances involved, effectively coordinate the activities of the control programs with contiguous political subdivisions;
<br>
<br>(C) demonstrates to the Secretary (directly or through State officials) that the State in which such a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions is located has identified or will identify geographic areas in such State that have a significant need for control programs and will effectively coordinate such programs in such areas; and
<br>
<br>(D)(i) is located in a State that has received a grant under subsection (a); or
<br>
<br>(ii) that 1 demonstrates to the Secretary that the control program is consistent with existing State mosquito control plans or policies, or other applicable State preparedness plans.
<br>(3) Requirement of assessment and plan
<br>
<br>A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved—
<br>
<br>(A) has conducted an assessment to determine the immediate needs in such subdivision or consortium for a control program, including an entomological survey of potential mosquito breeding areas; and
<br>
<br>(B) has, on the basis of such assessment, developed a plan for carrying out such a program.
<br>(4) Requirement of matching funds
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to the costs of a control program to be carried out under paragraph (1) by a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions, a grant under such paragraph may be made only if the subdivision or consortium agrees to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that is not less than 1/3 of such costs ($1 for each $2 of Federal funds provided in the grant).
<br>(B) Determination of amount contributed
<br>
<br>Non-Federal contributions required in subparagraph (A) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.
<br>(C) Waiver
<br>
<br>The Secretary may waive the requirement established in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) extraordinary economic conditions in the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved justify the waiver; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the geographical area covered by a political subdivision or consortium for a grant under paragraph (1) has an extreme mosquito control need due to—
<br>
<br>(I) the size or density of the potentially impacted human population;
<br>
<br>(II) the size or density of a mosquito population that requires heightened control; or
<br>
<br>(III) the severity of the mosquito-borne disease, such that expected serious adverse health outcomes for the human population justify the waiver.
<br>(5) Reports to Secretary
<br>
<br>A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved agrees that, promptly after the end of the fiscal year for which the grant is made, the subdivision or consortium will submit to the Secretary, and to the State within which the subdivision or consortium is located, a report that describes the control program and contains an evaluation of whether the program was effective.
