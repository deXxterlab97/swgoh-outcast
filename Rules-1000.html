<br>
<br>"(2) Such fraud includes the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) Misrepresentations regarding the provision of sources from which consumers may obtain financial assistance (including scholarships, grants, loans, tuition, awards, and other assistance) for purposes of financing a college education.
<br>
<br>"(B) Misrepresentations regarding the provision of portfolios of such assistance tailored to the needs of specific consumers.
