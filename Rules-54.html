<br>
<br> 
<br>know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great fear:
<br>3	And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?
<br>4	Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven,
<br>5	And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.
<br>6	And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.
<br>7	And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:
<br>8	And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.
<br>9	And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king’s let- ters. And the king had sent with me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.
<br>10	And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Is- rael.
<br>11	And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
<br> 
<br>12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.
<br>13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire.
<br>14	And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.
<br>15	And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.
<br>16	But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.
<br>17	Then I said to them: You know the afflic- tion wherein we are, because Jerusalem is deso- late, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.
<br>18	And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king’s words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good.
<br>19	But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king? 20 And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Then Eliasib the high priest arose, and his brethren the priests, and they built the flock gate: they sanctified it, and set up the doors thereof, even unto the tower of a hundred cubits they sanctified it unto the tower of Hananeel.
<br>2 And next to him the men of Jericho built: and next to them built Zachur the son of Amri. 3 But the fish gate the sons of Asnaa built: they covered it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars. And next to them built
<br>Marimuth the son of Urias the son of Accus.
<br>6	And Joiada the son of Phasea, and Mosol- lam the son of Besodia built the old gate: they covered it and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars.
<br>7	And next to them built Meltias the Gabaonite, and Jadon the Meronathite, the men of Gabaon and Maspha, for the governor that was in the country beyond the river.
<br>8	And next to him built Eziel the son of Araia the goldsmith: and next to him built Ananias the son of the perfumer: and they left Jerusalem unto the wall of the broad street.

<br>13	And the gate of the valley Hanun built,
<br> 
<br>and the inhabitants of Zanoe: they built it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall unto the gate of the dunghill.
<br>14	And the gate of the dunghill Melchias the son of Rechab built, lord of the street of Bethacharam: he built it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars.
<br>15	And the gate of the fountain, Sellum, the son of Cholhoza, built, lord of the street of Mas- pha: he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars, and the walls of the pool of Siloe unto the king’s guard, and unto the steps that go down from the city of David.
<br>16	After him built Nehemias the son of Azboc, lord of half the street of Bethsur, as far as over against the sepulchre of David, and to the pool, that was built with great labour, and to the house of the mighty.
<br>17	After him built the Levites, Rehum the son of Benni. After him built Hasebias, lord of half the street of Ceila in his own street.
<br>18	After him built their brethren Bavai the son of Enadad, lord of half Ceila.
<br>19	And next to him Aser the son of Josue, lord of Maspha, built another measure, over against the going up of the strong corner.
<br>20	After him in the mount Baruch the son of Zachai built another measure, from the corner to the door of the house of Eliasib the high priest. 21 After him Merimuth the son of Urias the son of Haccus, built another measure, from the door of the house of Eliasib, to the end of the
<br>house of Eliasib.
<br>22	And after him built the priests, the men of the plains of the Jordan.
<br>23	After him built Benjamin and Hasub, over against their own house: and after him built Azarias the son of Maasias the son of Ananias

<br>25	Phalel, the son of Ozi, over against the bending and the tower, which lieth out from the king’s high house, that is, in the court of the prison: after him Phadaia the son of Pharos.
<br>26	And the Nathinites dwelt in Ophel, as far as over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that stood out.
<br>27	After him the Thecuites built another mea- sure over against, from the great tower that standeth out unto the wall of the temple.
<br>28	And upward from the horse gate the priests built, every man over against his house.

<br>31	And within the chamber of the corner of the flock gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants built.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the Jews. 2 And said before his brethren, and the multi- tude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews
<br> 
<br>doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day?   are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?
<br>3	Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said: Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.
<br>4	Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.
<br>5	Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.
<br>6	So we built the wall, and joined it all to- gether unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.
<br>7	And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Am- monites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry.
<br>8	And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.
<br>9	And we prayed to our God, and set watch- men upon the wall day and night against them. 10 And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall. 11 And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease. 12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to
<br>us,
<br>13 I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.
<br>15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel.   And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.
<br>16	And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda. 17 Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he
<br>held a sword.
<br>18	For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins.   And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.
<br>19	And I said to the nobles, and to the mag- istrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another:
<br>20	In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for us.
<br>21	And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.
<br>22	At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work.
<br>23	Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stripped himself when he was to be washed.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
<br>2	And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: let us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.
<br>3	And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn because of the famine.
<br>4	And others said: Let us borrow money for the king’s tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:
<br>5	And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Be- hold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bond- women already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields and our vineyards other men possess.
<br>6	And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry according to these words.
<br>7	And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one exact usury of your brethren? And I gathered together a great as- sembly against them,
<br>8	And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.
<br>9	And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies?
<br>10	Both I and my brethren, and my servants,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.
<br>11	Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.
<br>12	And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.
<br>13	Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that shall not accom- plish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according to what was said.
<br>14	And from the day, in which the king com- manded me to be governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.
<br>15	But the former governors that had been be- fore me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sicles: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of God. 16 Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were
<br>gathered together to the work.
<br>17	The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.
<br>18	And there was prepared for me day be day one ox, and six choice rams, besides fowls, and
<br> 
<br>once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much impoverished.
<br>19	Remember me, O my God, for good ac- cording to all that I have done for this people.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and To- bias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,) 2 Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But they thought
<br>to do me mischief.
<br>3	And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.
<br>4	And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.
<br>5	And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:
<br>6	It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them: for which end
<br>7	Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.
<br>8	And I sent to them, saying: There is no
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.
<br>9	For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:
<br>10	And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.
<br>11	And I said: Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in. 12 And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat
<br>had hired him.
<br>13	For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.
<br>14	Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and San- aballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.
<br>15	But the wall was finished the five and twen- tieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.
<br>16	And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.
<br>17	Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.
<br>18	For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Seche-
<br> 
<br>nias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.
<br>19	And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Now after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and numbered the porters and singing men, and Levites:
<br>2	I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the house of Jerusalem,  (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that feared God above the rest,)
<br>3	And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every man over against his house.
<br>4	And the city was very wide and great, and the people few in the midst thereof, and the houses were not built.
<br>5	But God had put in my heart, and I assem- bled the princes and magistrates, and common people, to number them: and I found a book of the number of them who came up at first and therein it was found written:
<br>6	These are the children of the province, who came up from the captivity of them that had been carried away, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away, and who re- turned into Judea, every one into his own city.
<br>7	Who came with Zorobabel, Josue, Ne- hemias, Azarias, Raamias, Nahamani, Mar- dochai, Belsam, Mespharath, Begoia, Nahum, Baana. The number of the men of the people

<br>

<br>60	All the Nathinites, and the children of the servants of Solomon, three hundred ninety-two.
<br>61	And these are they that came up from Telmela, Thelharsa, Cherub, Addon, and Em- mer: and could not shew the house of their fa- thers, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. 62 The children of Dalaia, the children of To- bia, the children of Necoda, six hundred forty-
<br>two.
<br>63	And of the priests, the children of Habia, the children of Accos, the children of Berzellai, who took a wife of the daughters of Berzellai the Galaadite, and he was called by their name.
<br>64	These sought their writing in the record, and found it not: and they were cast out of the
<br> 
<br>priesthood.
<br>65	And Athersatha said to them, that they should not eat of the holies of holies, until there stood up a priest learned and skilful.
<br>66	All the multitude as it were one man, forty- two thousand three hundred sixty,
<br>67	Beside their menservants and womenser- vants, who were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven: and among them singing men, and singing women, two hundred forty-five.
<br>68	Their horses, seven hundred thirty-six: their mules two hundred forty-five.
<br>69	Their camels, four hundred thirty-five, their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
<br>70	And some of the heads of the families gave unto the work. Athersatha gave into the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty bowls, and five hundred and thirty garments for priests.
<br>71	And some of the heads of families gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver.
<br>72	And that which the rest of the people gave, was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty-seven gar- ments for priests.
<br>73	And the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singing men, and the rest of the common people, and the Nathinites, and all Israel dwelt in their cities.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the seventh month came: and the children of Israel were in their cities. And all the people were gathered together as one man to the street which is before the water gate, and they spoke to Esdras the scribe, to bring the book of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.
<br>2	Then Esdras the priest brought the law be- fore the multitude of men and women, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month.
<br>3	And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water gate, from the morning until midday, before the men, and the women, and all those that could understand: and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book.
<br>4	And Esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood, which he had made to speak upon, and there stood by him Mathathias, and Semeia, and Ania, and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand: and on the left, Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia and Mosollam.
<br>5	And Esdras opened the book before all the people: for he was above all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people stood.
<br>6	And Esdras blessed the Lord the great God: and all the people answered, Amen, amen: lift- ing up their hands: and they bowed down, and adored God with their faces to the ground.
<br>7	Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephtai, Odia, Maasia, Celtia, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the Levites, made si- lence among the people to hear the law: and the people stood in their place.
<br>8	And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly and plainly to be understood: and they understood when it was read.
<br>9	And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and Es- dras the priest and scribe, and the Levites who interpreted to all the people, said: This is a holy day to the Lord our God: do not mourn, nor weep: for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
<br>10	And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats,
<br> 
<br>and drink sweet wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves: because it is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad: for the joy of the Lord is our strength.
<br>11	And the Levites stilled all the people, say- ing: Hold your peace, for the day is holy, and be not sorrowful.
<br>12	So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth: because they understood the words that he had taught them.
<br>13	And on the second day the chiefs of the families of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Esdras the scribe, that he should interpret to them the words of the law.
<br>14	And they found written in the law, that the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in tabernacles, on the feast, in the seventh month:
<br>15	And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, say- ing: Go forth to the mount, and fetch branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to make tabernacles, as it is written. 16 And the people went forth, and brought.
<br>And they made themselves tabernacles every man on the top of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
<br>17	And all the assembly of them that were returned from the captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since the days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not done so, until that day: and there was ex- ceeding great joy.
<br>18	And he read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day till the last, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>they kept the solemnity seven days, and in the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And in the four and twentieth day of the month the children of Israel came together with fasting and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.
<br>2	And the seed of the children of Israel sepa- rated themselves from every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
<br>3	And they rose up to stand: and they read in the book of the law of the Lord their God, four times in the day, and four times they confessed, and adored the Lord their God.
<br>4	And there stood up upon the step of the Levites, Josue, and Bani, and Cedmihel, Saba- nia, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.
<br>5	And the Levites Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Oduia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, bless the Lord your God from eternity to eternity: and blessed be the high name of thy glory with all blessing and praise.
<br>6	Thou thyself, O Lord alone, thou hast made heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all the host thereof: the earth and all things that are in it: the seas and all that are therein: and thou givest life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.
<br>7	Thou O Lord God, art he who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraham.
<br>8	And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest a covenant with him, to
<br> 
<br>give him the land of the Chanaanite, of the Het- hite, and of the Amorrhite, and of the Pherezite, and of the Jebusite, and of the Gergezite, to give it to his seed: and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art just.
<br>9	And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt: and thou didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.
<br>10	And thou shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharao, and upon all his servants, and upon the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as it is at this day.
<br>11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land: but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into mighty waters.
<br>12	And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, that they might see the way by which they went.
<br>13	Thou camest down also to mount Sinai, and didst speak with them from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of truth, ceremonies, and good precepts.
<br>14	Thou madest known to them thy holy sab- bath, and didst prescribe to them command- ments, and ceremonies, and the law by the hand of Moses thy servant.
<br>15	And thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst, and thou saidst to them that they should go in, and pos- sess the land, upon which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them.
<br>16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments.
<br>17	And they would not hear, and they remem- bered not thy wonders which thou hadst done for them. And they hardened their necks, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>gave the head to return to their bondage, as it were by contention. But thou, a forgiving God, gracious, and merciful, longsuffering, and full of compassion, didst not forsake them.
<br>18	Yea when they had made also to them- selves a molten calf, and had said: This is thy God, that brought thee out of Egypt: and had committed great blasphemies:
<br>19	Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in the desert: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way, and the pillar of fire by night to shew them the way by which they should go.
<br>20	And thou gavest them thy good Spirit to teach them, and thy manna thou didst not with- hold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water for their thirst.
<br>21	Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and nothing was wanting to them: their garments did not grow old, and their feet were not worn.
<br>22	And thou gavest them kingdoms, and na- tions, and didst divide lots for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king of Hesebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.
<br>23	And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess it.
<br>24	And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Chanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.
<br>25	And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were
<br> 
<br>filled, and became fat, and abounded with de- light in thy great goodness.
<br>26	But they provoked thee to wrath, and de- parted from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admon- ished them earnestly to return to thee: and they were guilty of great blasphemies.
<br>27	And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies.
<br>28	But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight: and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had domin- ion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from heaven, and deliv- eredst them many times in thy mercies.
<br>29	And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law. But they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
<br>30	And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands.
<br>31	Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them: be- cause thou art a merciful and gracious God.
<br>32	Now therefore our God, great, strong, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fa- thers, and all the people from the days of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>king of Assur, until this day.
<br>33	And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly.
<br>34	Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them.
<br>35	And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices.
<br>36	Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it.
<br>37	And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.
<br>38	And because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign it.

<br>29	All that could understand, promising for their brethren, with their chief men, and they came to promise, and swear that they would walk in the law of God, which he gave in the hand of Moses the servant of God, that they would do and keep all the commandments of the Lord our God, and his judgments and his ceremonies.
<br>30	And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land, nor take their daugh- ters for our sons.
<br>31	And if the people of the land bring in things to sell, or any things for use, to sell them on the sabbath day, that we would not buy them on the sabbath, or on the holy day. And that we would
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every hand.
<br>32	And we made ordinances for ourselves, to give the third part of a sicle every year for the work of the house of our God,
<br>33	For the loaves of proposition, and for the continual sacrifice, and for a continual holocaust on the sabbaths, on the new moons, on the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin of- fering: that atonement might be made for Israel, and for every use of the house of our God.
<br>34	And we cast lots among the priests, and the Levites, and the people for the offering of wood, that it might be brought into the house of our God by the houses of our fathers at set times, from year to year: to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law of Moses:
<br>35	And that we would bring the firstfruits of our land, and the firstfruits of all fruit of every tree, from year to year, in the house of our Lord.
<br>36	And the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our oxen, and of our sheep, to be of- fered in the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God.
<br>37	And that we would bring the firstfruits of our meats, and of our libations, and the fruit of every tree, of the vintage also and of oil to the priests, to the storehouse of our God, and the tithes of our ground to the Levites. The Levites also shall receive the tithes of our works out of all the cities.
<br>38	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the tithes of the Levites, and the Levites shall offer the tithe of their tithes in the house of our God, to the storeroom into the treasure house.
<br>39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall carry to the treasury the firstfruits
<br> 
<br>of corn, of wine, and of oil: and the sanctified vessels shall be there, and the priests, and the singing men, and the porters, and ministers, and we will not forsake the house of our God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And the princes of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: but the rest of the people cast lots, to take one part in ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.
<br>2	And the people blessed all the men that will- ingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
<br>3	These therefore are the chief men of the province, who dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda. And every one dwelt in his pos- session, in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the Nathinites, and the children of the servants of Solomon.
<br>4	And in Jerusalem there dwelt some of the children of Juda, and some of the children of Benjamin: of the children of Juda, Athaias the son of Aziam,   the son of Zacharias,   the son of Amarias, the son of Saphatias, the son of Malaleel: of the sons of Phares,
<br>5	Maasia the son of Baruch, the son of Chol- hoza, the son of Hazia, the son of Adaia, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zacharias, the son of the Silonite:
<br>6	All these the sons of Phares, who dwelt in Jerusalem, were four hundred sixty-eight valiant men.
<br>7	And these are the children of Benjamin: Sel- lum the son of Mosollam, the son of Joed, the son of Phadaia, the son of Colaia, the son of Masia, the son of Etheel, the son of Isaia.
<br>8	And after him Gebbai, Sellai, nine hundred twenty-eight.
<br>9	And Joel the son of Zechri their ruler, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Judas the son of Senua was second over the city.
<br>10	And of the priests Idaia the son of Joarib, Jachin,
<br>11	Saraia the son of Helcias, the son of Mosol- lam, the son of Sadoc, the son of Meraioth, the son of Achitob the prince of the house of God,
<br>12	And their brethren that do the works of the temple: eight hundred twenty-two. And Adaia the son of Jeroham, the son of Phelelia, the son of Amsi, the son of Zacharias, the son of Pheshur, the son of Melchias,
<br>13	And his brethren the chiefs of the fathers: two hundred forty-two. And Amassai the son of Azreel, the son of Ahazi, the son of Mosollamoth, the son of Emmer,
<br>14	And their brethren who were very mighty, a hundred twenty-eight: and their ruler Zabdiel son of the mighty.
<br>15	And of the Levites Semeia the son of Ha- sub, the son of Azaricam, the son of Hasabia, the son of Boni,
<br>16	And Sabathai and Jozabed, who were over all the outward business of the house of God, of the princes of the Levites,
<br>17	And Mathania the son of Micha, the son of Zebedei, the son of Asaph, was the principal man to praise, and to give glory in prayer, and Becbecia, the second, one of his brethren, and Abda the son of Samua, the son of Galal, the son of Idithun.
<br>18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four.
<br>19	And the porters, Accub, Telmon, and their brethren, who kept the doors: a hundred seventy-two.
<br>20	And the rest of Israel, the priests and the Levites were in all the cities of Juda, every man in his possession.
<br>21	And the Nathinites, that dwelt in Ophel, and Siaha, and Gaspha of the Nathinites.
<br> 
<br>22	And the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem, was Azzi the son of Bani, the son of Hasabia, the son of Mathania, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, were the singing men in the ministry of the house of God.
<br>23	For the king’s commandment was concern- ing them, and an order among the singing men day by day.
<br>24	And Phathahia the son of Mesezebel of the children of Zara the son of Juda was at the hand of the king, in all matters concerning the people,
<br>25	And in the houses through all their coun- tries. Of the children of Juda some dwelt at Cariath-Arbe, and in the villages thereof: and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof: and at Cabseel, and in the villages thereof.
<br>26	And at Jesue, and at Molada, and at Beth- phaleth,
<br>27	And at Hasersuel, and at Bersabee, and in the villages thereof,
<br>28	And at Siceleg, and at Mochona, and in the villages thereof,
<br>29	And at Remmon, and at Saraa, and at Jer- imuth,
<br>30	Zanoa, Odollam, and   in   their   villages, at Lachis and its dependencies, and at Azeca and the villages thereof. And they dwelt from Bersabee unto the valley of Ennom.
<br>31	And the children of Benjamin, from Geba, at Mechmas, and at Hai, and at Bethel, and in the villages thereof,
<br>32	At Anathoth, Nob, Anania,
<br>33	Asor, Rama, Gethaim,
<br>34	Hadid, Seboim, and Neballat, Lod,
<br>35	And Ono the valley of craftsmen.
<br>36	And of the Levites were portions of Juda and Benjamin.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Now these are the priests and the Levites, that went up with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue: Saraia, Jeremias, Esdras,
<br>2	Amaria, Melluch, Hattus,
<br>3	Sebenias, Rheum, Merimuth,
<br>4	Addo, Genthon, Abia,
<br>5	Miamin, Madia, Belga,
<br>6	Semeia, and Joiarib, Idaia, Sellum Amoc, Helcias,
<br>7	Idaia. These were the chief of the priests, and of their brethren in the days of Josue.
<br>8	And the Levites, Jesua, Bennui,  Cedmi- hel, Sarebia, Juda, Mathanias, they and their brethren were over the hymns:
<br>9	And Becbecia, and Hanni, and their brethren every one in his office.
<br>10	And Josue begot Joacim, and Joacim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib begot Joiada,
<br>11	And Joiada begot Jonathan and Jonathan begot Jeddoa.
<br>12	And in the days of Joacim the priests and heads of the families were: Of Saraia, Maraia: of Jeremias, Hanania:
<br>13	Of Esdras, Mosollam: and of Amaria, Jo- hanan:
<br>14	Of Milicho, Jonathan: of Sebenia, Joseph:
<br>15	Of Haram, Edna: of Maraioth, Helci:
<br>16	Of Adaia, Zacharia: of Genthon, Mosol- lam:
<br>17	Of Abia, Zechri: of Miamin and Moadia, Phelti:
<br>18	Of Belga, Sammua of Semaia, Jonathan: 19 Of Joiarib, Mathanai:  of  Jodaia,  Azzi: 20 Of Sellai, Celai: of Amoc, Heber:
<br>21	Of Helcias, Hasebia: of Idaia, Nathanael.
<br>22	The Levites the chiefs of the families in the days of Eliasib, and Joiada, and Johanan,
<br> 
<br>and Jeddoa, were recorded, and the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian.
<br>23	The sons of Levi, heads of the families were written in the book of Chronicles, even unto the days of Jonathan the son of Eliasib.
<br>24	Now the chief of the Levites were Hase- bia, Serebia, and Josue the son of Cedmihel: and their brethren by their courses, to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, and to wait equally in order.
<br>25	Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon, Accub, were keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the gates.
<br>26	These were in the days of Joacim the son of Josue, the son of Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias the governor, and of Esdras the priest and scribe.
<br>27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, and to keep the dedication, and to rejoice with thanksgiving, and with singing, and with cymbals, and psalter- ies and harps.
<br>28	And the sons of the singing men were gath- ered together out of the plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of Nethuphati, 29 And from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singing men had built themselves villages round about
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>30	And the priests and the Levites were puri- fied, and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
<br>31	And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate.
<br>32	And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of Juda,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>33	And Azarias, Esdras, and Mosollam, Ju- das, and Benjamin, and Semeia, and Jeremias.
<br>34	And of the sons of the priests with trum- pets, Zacharias the son of Jonathan, the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania, the son of Michaia, the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph,
<br>35	And his brethren Semeia, and Azareel, Malalai, Galalai, Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before them at the fountain gate.
<br>36	And they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the water gate eastward:
<br>37	And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,
<br>38	And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and even to the flock gate: and they stood still in the watch gate.
<br>39	And the two choirs of them that gave praise stood still at the house of God, and I and the half of the magistrates with me.
<br>40	And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Mi- amin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets,
<br>41	And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was their overseer:
<br>42	And they sacrificed on that day great sacri- fices, and they rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their wives also and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
<br> 
<br>43	They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that assisted.
<br>44	And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
<br>45	For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to God. 46 And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites
<br>sanctified the sons of Aaron.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever:
<br>2	Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned the curse into blessing.
<br>3	And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.
<br>4	And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.
<br>5	And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests.
<br>6	But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artax- erxes king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:
<br>7	And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God.
<br>8	And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.
<br>9	And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.
<br>10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that min- istered were fled away every man to his own country:
<br>11	And I pleaded the matter against the mag- istrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.
<br>12	And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.
<br>13	And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were commit- ted the portions of their brethren.
<br>14	Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies.
<br>15	In those days I saw in Juda some treading
<br> 
<br>the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.
<br>16	Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem.
<br>17	And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day:
<br>18	Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.
<br>19	And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I com- manded that they should not open them till af- ter the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.
<br>20	So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem, once or twice.
<br>21	And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so an- other time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.
<br>22	I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also re- member me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
<br>23	In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.
<br>24	And their children spoke half in the speech
<br> 
<br>
<br>of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews’ lan- guage, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.
<br>25	And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:
<br>26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing: and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Is- rael: and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.
<br>27	And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women:
<br>28	And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sana- ballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.
<br>29	Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.
<br>30	So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:
<br>31	And for the offering of wood at times ap- pointed, and for the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.

<br>Book of Tobias
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Tobias of the tribe and city of Nephtali, (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Naasson, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet,)
<br>2	When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,
<br>3	But every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow captives, that were of his kin- dred.
<br>4	And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephtali, yet did he no childish thing in his work.
<br>5	Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,
<br>6	And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Is- rael, offering faithfully all his firstfruits, and his tithes,
<br>7	So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.
<br>8	These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God.
<br>9	But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,
<br>10	And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.
<br>11	And when by the captivity he with his wife
<br> 
<br>
<br>and his son and all his tribe was come to the city of Ninive,
<br>12	(When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul and never was defiled with their meats.
<br>13	And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.
<br>14	And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.
<br>15	He therefore went to all that were in cap- tivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.
<br>16	And when he was come to Rages a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:
<br>17	And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.
<br>18	But after a long time, Salmanasar the king being dead, when Sennacherib his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:
<br>19	Tobias daily went among all his kindred and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:
<br>20	He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.
<br>21	And when king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea by reason of the slaugh-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ter that God had made about him for his blas- phemy, and being angry slew many of the chil- dren of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies.
<br>22	But when it was told the king, he com- manded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.
<br>23	But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife, lay concealed, for many loved him.
<br>24	But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.
<br>25	And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>But after this, when there was a festival of the Lord, and a good dinner was prepared in Tobias’s house,
<br>2	He said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear God, to feast with us.
<br>3	And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body.
<br>4	And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.
<br>5	And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,
<br>6	Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning. 7 So when the sun was down, he went and
<br>buried him.
<br>8 Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst
<br> 
<br>scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?
<br>9	But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.
<br>10	Now it happened one day that being wea- ried with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,
<br>11	And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow’s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.
<br>12	Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.
<br>13	For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he re- pined not against God because the evil of blind- ness had befallen him,
<br>14	But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.
<br>15	For as the kings insulted over holy Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:
<br>16	Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?
<br>17	But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:
<br>18	For we are the children of saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.
<br>19	Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.
<br>20	Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:
<br>21	And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take  heed, lest perhaps it be stolen:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.
<br>22	At these words his wife being angry an- swered: It is evident the hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.
<br>23	And with these and other, such like words she upbraided him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,
<br>2	Saying, Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment:
<br>3	And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offences, nor those of my parents.
<br>4	For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captiv- ity, and death, and are made a fable, and a re- proach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.
<br>5	And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy pre- cepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee. 6 And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to
<br>live.
<br>7	Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in Rages a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father’s ser- vant maids,
<br>8	Because she had been given to seven hus- bands and a devil named Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.
<br>9	So when she reproved the maid for her fault,
<br> 
<br>she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou mur- derer of thy husbands.
<br>10	Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands? At these words, she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:
<br>11	But continuing in prayer with tears be- sought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.
<br>12	And it came to pass on the third day when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,
<br>13	She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers, who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation for- givest the sins of them that call upon thee.
<br>14	To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.
<br>15	I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.
<br>16	Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never cov- eted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.
<br>17	Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.
<br>18	But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.
<br>19	And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man,
<br>20	For thy counsel is not in man’s power.
<br>21	But this every one is sure of that worship- peth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	For thou art not delighted in our being lost, because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyful- ness.
<br>23	Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever,
<br>24	At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:
<br>25	And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Therefore when Tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias his son,
<br>2	And said to him: Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a foundation in thy heart.
<br>3	When God shall take my soul, thou shalt bury my body: and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:
<br>4	For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.
<br>5	And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.
<br>6	And all the days of thy life have God in thy mind: and take heed thou never consent to sin, nor transgress the commandments of the Lord our God.
<br>7	Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee.
<br>8	According to thy ability be merciful.
<br>9	If thou have much give abundantly: if thou have little, take care even so to bestow willingly
<br> 
<br>a little.
<br>10	For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of necessity.
<br>11	For alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.
<br>12	Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it.
<br>13	Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.
<br>14	Never suffer pride to reign in thy mind, or in thy words: for from it all perdition took its beginning.
<br>15	If any man hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all. 16 See thou never do to another what thou
<br>wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.
<br>17	Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked,
<br>18	Lay out thy bread, and thy wine upon the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.
<br>19	Seek counsel always of a wise man.
<br>20	Bless God at all times: and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.
<br>21	I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages a city of the Medes, and I have a note of his hand with me:
<br>22	Now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the foresaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand. 23 Fear not, my son: we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many good things if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that
<br>which is good.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast com- manded me.
<br>2	But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.
<br>3	Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.
<br>4	But go now, and seek thee out some faith- ful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.
<br>5	Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.
<br>6	And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?
<br>7	But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?
<br>8	And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.
<br>9	And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I be- seech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.
<br>10	Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.
<br>11	So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.
<br>12	And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness and see not the
<br> 
<br>light of heaven?
<br>13	And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.
<br>14	And Tobias said to him: Canst thou con- duct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.
<br>15	And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.
<br>16	And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?
<br>17	And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?
<br>18	But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.
<br>19	And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I de- sired to know thy family.
<br>20	And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.
<br>21	And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.
<br>22	Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.
<br>23	And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us. 24 I wish the money for which thou hast sent
<br>him, had never been.
<br>25	For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.
<br>26	And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>27	For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.
<br>28	At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.
<br>2	And he went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.
<br>3	And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me.
<br>4	And the angel said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.
<br>5	Then the angel said to him: Take out the entrails of this fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.
<br>6	And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages the city of the Medes.
<br>7	Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?
<br>8	And the angel, answering, said to him: If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them.
<br> 
<br>9	And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.
<br>10	And Tobias said to him: Where wilt thou that we lodge?
<br>11	And the angel answering, said: Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.
<br>12	All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.
<br>13	Ask her therefore of her father, and he will give her thee to wife.
<br>14	Then Tobias answered, and said: I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died: moreover I have heard, that a devil killed them.
<br>15	Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me also: and whereas I am the only child of my parents, I should bring down their old age with sorrow to hell.
<br>16	Then the angel Raphael said to him: Hear me, and I will shew thee who they are, over whom the devil can prevail.
<br>17	For they who in such manner receive mat- rimony, as to shut out God from themselves, and from their mind, and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule, which have not un- derstanding, over them the devil hath power.
<br>18	But thou when thou shalt take her, go into the chamber, and for three days keep thyself con- tinent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to prayers with her.
<br>19	And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the devil shall be driven away.
<br>20	But the second night thou shalt be admit- ted into the society of the holy Patriarchs.
<br>21	And the third night thou shalt obtain a blessing that sound children may be born of you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	And when the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin with the fear of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that in the seed of Abraham thou mayst obtain a blessing in children.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with joy.
<br>2	And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to Anna his wife: How like is this young man to my cousin?
<br>3	And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?
<br>4	But they said: We are of the tribe of Neph- tali, of the captivity of Ninive.
<br>5	And Raguel said to them: Do you know To- bias my brother? And they said: We know him.
<br>6	And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young man’s father.
<br>7	And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.
<br>8	And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.
<br>9	And after they had spoken, Raguel com- manded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,
<br>10	Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.
<br>11	Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven hus- bands, that went in unto her: and he began to
<br> 
<br>fear lest it might happen to him also in like man- ner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no an- swer to his petition,
<br>12	The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore an- other could not have her.
<br>13	Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight. 14 And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to
<br>thee.
<br>15	And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his blessing in you.
<br>16	And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.
<br>17	And afterwards they made merry, blessing God.
<br>18	And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and bade her to prepare another chamber.
<br>19	And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.
<br>20	And she said to her: Be of good cheer, my daughter: the Lord of heaven give thee joy for the trouble thou hast undergone.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>
<br>And after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her.
<br>2 And Tobias remembering the angel’s word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Then the angel Raphael took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt.
<br>4	Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God to day, and to morrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are joined to God: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.
<br>5	For we are the children of saints, and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God.
<br>6	So they both arose, and  prayed earnestly both together that health might be given them, 7 And Tobias said: Lord God of our fathers, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy crea-
<br>tures that are in them, bless thee.
<br>8	Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve for a helper.
<br>9	And now, Lord, thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in which thy name may be blessed for ever and ever.
<br>10	Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both to- gether in health.
<br>11	And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.
<br>12	For he said: Lest perhaps it may have hap- pened to him, in like manner as it did to the other seven husbands, that went in unto her.
<br>13	And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her:
<br>14	Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day.
<br>15	So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.
<br> 
<br>16	And returning she brought the good news: and Raguel and Anna his wife blessed the Lord, 17 And said: We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we sus-
<br>pected.
<br>18	For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.
<br>19	And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth.
<br>20	And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.
<br>21	And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.
<br>22	He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be pre- pared for all his neighbours, and all his friends, 23 And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with
<br>him two weeks.
<br>24 And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made a writing, that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Then Tobias called the angel to him, whom he took to be a man, and said to him: Brother Azarias, I pray thee hearken to my words:
<br>2	If I should give myself to be thy servant I should not make a worthy return for thy care.
<br>3	However, I beseech thee, to take with thee beasts and servants, and to go to Gabelus to Rages the city of the Medes: and to restore to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him his note of hand, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my wedding. 4 For thou knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I stay one day more, his soul
<br>will be afflicted.
<br>5	And indeed thou seest how Raguel hath ad- jured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise.
<br>6	Then Raphael took four of Raguel’s servants, and two camels, and went to Rages the city of the Medes: and finding Gabelus, gave him his note of hand, and received of him all the money. 7 And he told him concerning Tobias the son of Tobias, all that had been done: and made him
<br>come with him to the wedding.
<br>8	And when he was come into Raguel’s house he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaped up, and they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God,
<br>9	And said: The God of Israel bless thee, be- cause thou art the son of a very good and just man, and that feareth God, and doth almsdeeds: 10 And may a blessing come upon thy wife
<br>and upon your parents.
<br>11	And may you see your children, and your children’s children, unto the third and fourth generation: and may your seed be blessed by the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever.
<br>12	And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but the marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>But as Tobias made longer stay upon occasion of the marriage, Tobias his father was solicitous, saying: Why thinkest thou doth my son tarry, or why is he detained there?
<br>2	Is Gabelus dead, thinkest thou, and no man will pay him the money?
<br> 
<br>3	And he began to be exceeding sad, both he and Anna his wife with him: and they began both to weep together, because their son did not return to them on the day appointed.
<br>4	But his mother wept and was quite discon- solate, and said: Woe, woe is me, my son; why did we send thee to go to a strange country, the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the comfort of our life, the hope of our posterity?
<br>5	We having all things together in thee alone, ought not to have let thee go from us.
<br>6	And Tobias said to her: Hold thy peace, and be not troubled, our son is safe: that man with whom we sent him is very trusty.
<br>7	But she could by no means be comforted, but daily running out looked round about, and went into all the ways by which there seemed any hope he might return, that she might if possible see him coming afar off.
<br>8	But Raguel said to his son in law: Stay here, and I will send a messenger to Tobias thy father, that thou art in health.
<br>9	And Tobias said to him: I know that my father and mother now count the days, and their spirit is grievously afflicted within them.
<br>10	And when Raguel had pressed Tobias with many words, and he by no means would hearken to him, he delivered Sara unto him, and half of all his substance in menservants, and womenser- vants, in cattle, in camels, and in kine, and in much money, and sent him away safe and joyful from him,
<br>11	Saying: The holy angel of the Lord be with you in your journey, and bring you through safe, and that you may find all things well about your parents, and my eyes may see your children be- fore I die.
<br>12	And the parents taking their daughter kissed her, and let her go:
<br>13	Admonishing her to honour her father and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>mother in law, to love her husband, to take care of the family, to govern the house, and to behave herself irreprehensibly.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And as they were returning they came to Cha- ran, which is in the midway to Ninive, the eleventh day.
<br>2	And the angel said: Brother Tobias, thou knowest how thou didst leave thy father.
<br>3	If it please thee therefore, let us go before, and let the family follow softly after us, together with thy wife, and with the beasts.
<br>4	And as this their going pleased him, Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, for it will be necessary. So Tobias took some of that gall and departed.
<br>5	But Anna sat beside the way daily, on the top of a hill, from whence she might see afar off. 6 And while she watched his coming from that place, she saw him afar off, and presently per- ceived it was her son coming: and returning she told her husband, saying: Behold thy son
<br>cometh.
<br>7	And Raphael said to Tobias: As soon as thou shalt come into thy house, forthwith adore the Lord thy God: and giving thanks to him, go to thy father, and kiss him.
<br>8	And immediately anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. For be assured that his eyes shall be presently opened, and thy father shall see the light of heaven, and shall rejoice in the sight of thee.
<br>9	Then the dog, which had been with them in the way, ran before, and coming as if he had brought the news, shewed his joy by his fawning and wagging his tail.
<br>10	And his father that was blind, rising up,
<br> 
<br>began to run stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son.
<br>11	And receiving him kissed him, as did also his wife, and they began to weep for joy.
<br>12	And when they had adored God, and given him thanks, they sat down together.
<br>13	Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father’s eyes.
<br>14	And he stayed about half an hour: and a white skin began to come out of his eyes, like the skin of an egg.
<br>15	And Tobias took hold of it, and drew it from his eyes, and recovered his sight.
<br>16	And they glorified God, both he and his wife and all that knew him.
<br>17	And Tobias said: I bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saved me and behold I see Tobias my son.
<br>18	And after seven days Sara his son’s wife and all the family arrived safe, and the cattle, and the camels, and an abundance of money of his wife’s: and that money also which he had received of Gabelus,
<br>19	And he told his parents all the benefits of God, which he had done to him by the man that conducted him.
<br>20	And Achior and Nabath the kinsmen of Tobias came, rejoicing for Tobias, and congratu- lating with him for all the good things that God had done for him.
<br>21	And for seven days they feasted and re- joiced all with great joy.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Then Tobias called to him his son and said to him: What can we give to this holy man, that is come with thee?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or what can be worthy of his benefits?
<br>3	He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things? 4 But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept of one half of
<br>all things that have been brought.
<br>5	So the father and the son calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought,
<br>6	Then he said to them secretly, Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.
<br>7	For it is good to hide the secret of a king: to reveal and confess the works of God.
<br>8	Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold.
<br>9	For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.
<br>10	But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.
<br>11	I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.
<br>12	When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord. 13 And because thou wast acceptable to God,
<br>it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.
<br> 
<br>14	And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son’s wife from the devil.
<br>15	For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.
<br>16	And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.
<br>17	And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.
<br>18	For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and sing praises to him.
<br>19	I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by men.
<br>20	It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and publish all his wonderful works.
<br>21	And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more.
<br>22	Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God, and rising up, they told all his wonderful works.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And Tobias the elder opening his mouth, blessed the Lord, and said: Thou art great O Lord, for ever, and thy kingdom is unto all ages.
<br>2	For thou scourgest, and thou savest: thou leadest down to hell, and bringest up again: and there is none that can escape thy hand.
<br>3	Give glory to the Lord, ye children of Israel, and praise him in the sight of the Gentiles:
<br>4	Because he hath therefore scattered you among the Gentiles, who know not him, that you may declare his wonderful works, and make
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>them know that there is no other almighty God besides him.
<br>5	He hath chastised us for our iniquities: and he will save us for his own mercy.
<br>6	See then what he hath done with us, and with fear and trembling give ye glory to him: and extol the eternal King of worlds in your works.
<br>7	As for me, I will praise him in the land of my captivity: because he hath shewn his majesty toward a sinful nation,
<br>8	Be converted therefore, ye sinners, and do justice before God, believing that he will shew his mercy to you.
<br>9	And I and my soul will rejoice in him.
<br>10	Bless ye the Lord, all his elect, keep days of joy, and give glory to him.
<br>11	Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord hath chas- tised thee for the works of thy hands.
<br>12	Give glory to the Lord for thy good things, and bless the God eternal that he may rebuild his tabernacle in thee, and may call back all the captives to thee, and thou mayst rejoice for ever and ever.
<br>13	Thou shalt shine with a glorious light: and all the ends of the earth shall worship thee,
<br>14	Nations from afar shall come to thee: and shall bring gifts, and shall adore the Lord in thee, and shall esteem thy land as holy.
<br>15	For they shall call upon the great name in thee,
<br>16	They shall be cursed that shall despise thee: and they shall be condemned that shall blaspheme thee: and blessed shall they be that shall build thee up,
<br>17	But thou shalt rejoice in thy children, be- cause they shall all be blessed, and shall be gath- ered together to the Lord.
<br>18	Blessed are all they that love thee, and that rejoice in thy peace,
<br> 
<br>19	My soul, bless thou the Lord, because the Lord our God hath delivered Jerusalem his city from all her troubles.
<br>20	Happy shall I be if there shall remain of my seed, to see the glory of Jerusalem.
<br>21	The gates of Jerusalem shall be built of sap- phire, and of emerald, and all the walls thereof round about of precious stones.
<br>22	All its streets shall be paved with white and clean stones: and Alleluia shall be sung in its streets,
<br>23	Blessed be the Lord, who hath exalted it, and may he reign over it for ever and ever, Amen.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And the words of Tobias were ended. And after Tobias was restored to his sight, he lived two and forty years, and saw the children of his grandchil- dren.
<br>2	And after he had lived a hundred and two years, he was buried honorably in Ninive.
<br>3	For he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his eyes, and sixty when he re- covered it again.
<br>4	And the rest of his life was in joy, and with great increase of the fear of God he departed in peace.
<br>5	And at the hour of his death he called unto him his son Tobias and his children, seven young men, his grandsons, and said to them:
<br>6	The destruction of Ninive is at hand: for the word of the Lord must be fulfilled: and our brethren, that are scattered abroad from the land of Israel, shall return to it.
<br>7	And all the land thereof that is desert shall be filled with people, and the house of God which is burnt in it, shall again be rebuilt: and all that fear God shall return thither.
<br> 
<br>
<br>8	And the Gentiles shall leave their idols, and shall come into Jerusalem, and shall dwell in it. 9 And all the kings of the earth shall rejoice
<br>in it, adoring the King of Israel.
<br>10	Hearken therefore, my children, to your fa- ther: serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do the things that please him:
<br>11	And command your children that they do justice and almsdeeds, and that they be mindful of God, and bless him at all times in truth, and with all their power.
<br>12	And now, children, hear me, and do not stay here: but as soon as you shall bury your mother by me in one sepulchre, without delay direct your steps to depart hence:
<br>13	For I see that its iniquity will bring it to destruction.
<br>14	And it came to pass that after the death of his mother, Tobias departed out of Ninive with his wife, and children, and children’s children, and returned to his father and mother in law.
<br>15	And he found them in health in a good old age: and he took care of them, and he closed their eyes: and all the inheritance of Raguel’s house came to him: and he saw his children’s children to the fifth generation.
<br>16	And after he had lived ninety-nine years in the fear of the Lord, with joy they buried him.
<br>17	And all his kindred, and all his generation continued in good life, and in holy conversation, so that they were acceptable both to God, and to men, and to all that dwelt in the land.

<br>Book of Judith
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Now Arphaxad king of the Medes had brought many nations under his dominions, and he built a very strong city, which he called Ecbatana,
<br>2 Of stones squared and hewed: he made the walls thereof seventy cubits broad, and thirty cu- bits high, and the towers thereof he made a hun- dred cubits high. But on the square of them, each side was extended the space of twenty feet. 3 And he made the gates thereof according to
<br>the height of the towers:
<br>4	And he gloried as a mighty one in the force of his army and in the glory of his chariots.
<br>5	Now in the twelfth year of his reign, Nabu- chodonosor king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Ninive the great city, fought against Arphaxad and overcame him,
<br>6	In the great plain which is called Ragua, about the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Jadason, in the plain of Erioch the king of the Elicians.
<br>7	Then was the kingdom of Nabuchodonosor exalted, and his heart was elevated: and he sent to all that dwelt in Cilicia and Damascus, and Libanus,
<br>8	And to the nations that are in Carmelus, and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Asdrelon,
<br>9	And to all that were in Samaria, and be- yond the river Jordan even to Jerusalem, and all the land of Jesse till you come to the borders of
<br> 
<br>
<br>Ethiopia.
<br>10	To all these Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, sent messengers:
<br>11	But they all with one mind refused, and sent them back empty, and rejected them with- out honour.
<br>12	Then king Nabuchodonosor being angry against all that land, swore by his throne and kingdom that he would revenge himself of all those countries.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>In the thirteenth year of the reign of Nabu- chodonosor, the two and twentieth day of the first month, the word was given out in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, that he would revenge himself.
<br>2	And he called all the ancients, and all the governors, and his officers of war, and communi- cated to them the secret of his counsel:
<br>3	And he said that his thoughts were to bring all the earth under his empire.
<br>4	And when this saying pleased them all, Nabuchodonosor, the king, called Holofernes the general of his armies,
<br>5	And said to him: Go out against all the kingdoms of the west, and against them espe- cially that despised my commandment.
<br>6	Thy eye shall not spare any kingdom, and all the strong cities thou shalt bring under my
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>yoke.
<br>7	Then Holofernes called the captains, and officers of the power of the Assyrians: and he mustered men for the expedition, and the king commanded him, a hundred and twenty thou- sand fighting men on foot, and twelve thousand archers, horsemen.
<br>8	And he made all his warlike preparations to go before with a multitude of innumerable camels, with all provisions sufficient for the armies in abundance, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, without number.
<br>9	He appointed corn to be prepared out of all Syria in his passage.
<br>10	But gold and silver he took out of the king’s house in great abundance.
<br>11	And he went forth he and all the army, with the chariots, and horsemen, and archers, who covered the face of the earth, like locusts.
<br>12	And when he had passed through the bor- ders of the Assyrians, he came to the great mountains of Ange, which are on the left of Cili- cia: and he went up to all their castles, and took all the strong places.
<br>13	And he took by assault the renowned city of Melothus, and pillaged all the children of Tharsis, and the children of Ismahel, who were over against the face of the desert, and on the south of the land of Cellon.
<br>14	And he passed over the Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia: and he forced all the stately cities that were there, from the torrent of Mambre, till one comes to the sea:
<br>15	And he took the borders thereof, from Cili- cia to the coasts of Japheth, which are towards the south.
<br>16	And he carried away all the children of Ma- dian, and stripped them of all their riches, and all that resisted him he slew with the edge of the sword.
<br> 
<br>17	And after these things he went down into the plains of Damascus in the days of the har- vest, and he set all the corn on fire, and he caused all the trees and vineyards to be cut down.
<br>18	And the fear of them fell upon all the in- habitants of the land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Then the kings and the princes of all the cities and provinces, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Syria Sobal, and Libya, and Cilicia sent their ambas- sadors, who coming to Holofernes, said:
<br>2 Let thy indignation towards us cease, for it is better for us to live and serve Nabuchodonosor the great king, and be subject to thee, than to die and to perish, or suffer the miseries of slavery. 3 All our cities and our possessions, all moun- tains and hills, and fields, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our goods, and families are in thy
<br>sight:
<br>4	Let all we have be subject to thy law,
<br>5	Both we and our children are thy servants.
<br>6	Come to us a peaceable lord, and use our service as it shall please thee,
<br>7	Then he came down from the mountains with horsemen, in great power, and made him- self master of every city, and all the inhabitants of the land.
<br>8	And from all the cities he took auxiliaries valiant men, and chosen for war,
<br>9	And so great a fear lay upon all those provinces, that the inhabitants of all the cities, both princes and nobles, as well as the people, went out to meet him at his coming.
<br>10	And received him with garlands, and lights, and dances, and timbrels, and flutes.
<br>11	And though they did these things, they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>could not for all that mitigate the fierceness of his heart:
<br>12	For he both destroyed their cities, and cut down their groves.
<br>13	For Nabuchodonosor the king had com- manded him to destroy all the gods of the earth, that he only might be called God by those na- tions which could be brought under him by the power of Holofernes.
<br>14	And when he had passed through all Syria Sobal, and all Apamea, and all Mesopotamia, he came to the Idumeans into the land of Gabaa,
<br>15	And he took possession of their cities, and stayed there for thirty days, in which days he commanded all the troops of his army to be united.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Then the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Juda, hearing these things, were exceedingly afraid of him.
<br>2	Dread and horror seized upon their minds, lest he should do the same to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord, that he had done to other cities and their temples.
<br>3	And they sent into all Samaria round about, as far as Jericho, and seized upon all the tops of the mountains:
<br>4	And they compassed their towns with walls and gathered together corn for provision for war. 5 And Eliachim the priest wrote to all that were over against Esdrelon, which faceth the great plain  near Dothain, and  to all by  whom there might be a passage of way, that they should take possession of the ascents of the mountains, by which there might be any way to Jerusalem, and should keep watch where the way was nar-
<br>row between the mountains.
<br> 
<br>6	And the children of Israel did as the priests of the Lord Eliachim had appointed them.
<br>7	And all the people cried to the Lord with great earnestness, and they humbled their souls in fastings, and prayers, both they and their wives.
<br>8	And the priests put on haircloths, and they caused the little children to lie prostrate before the temple of the Lord, and the altar of the Lord they covered with haircloth.
<br>9	And they cried to the Lord the God of Is- rael with one accord, that their children might not be made a prey, and their wives carried off, and their cities destroyed, and their holy things profaned, and that they might not be made a reproach to the Gentiles.
<br>10	Then Eliachim the high priest of the Lord went about all Israel and spoke to them,
<br>11	Saying: Know ye that the Lord will hear your prayers, if you continue with perseverance in fastings and prayers in the sight of the Lord.
<br>12	Remember Moses the servant of the Lord overcame Amalec that trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his shields, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen, not by fighting with the sword, but by holy prayers:
<br>13	So all the enemies of Israel be, if you per- severe in this work which you have begun.
<br>14	So they being moved by this exhortation of his, prayed to the Lord, and continued in the sight of the Lord.
<br>15	So that even they who offered the holo- causts to the Lord, offered the sacrifices to the Lord girded with haircloths, and with ashes upon their head.
<br>16	And they all begged of God with all their heart, that he would visit his people Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And it was told Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians, that the children of Israel prepared themselves to resist, and had shut up the ways of the mountains.
<br>2	And he was transported with exceeding great fury and indignation, and he called all the princes of Moab and the leaders of Ammon.
<br>3	And he said to them: Tell me what is this people that besetteth the mountains: or what are their cities, and of what sort, and how great: also what is their power, or what is their multi- tude: or who is the king over their warfare:
<br>4	And why they above all that dwell in the east, have despised us, and have not come out to meet us, that they might receive us with peace? 5 Then Achior captain of all the children of Ammon answering, said; If thou vouchsafe, my lord, to hear, I will tell the truth in thy sight con- cerning this people, that dwelleth in the moun- tains, and there shall not a false word come out
<br>of my mouth.
<br>6	This people is of the offspring of the Chaldeans.
<br>7	They dwelt first in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, who were in the land of the Chaldeans.
<br>8	Wherefore forsaking the ceremonies of their fathers, which consisted in the worship of many gods,
<br>9	They worshipped one God of heaven, who also commanded them to depart from thence, and to dwell in Charan. And when there was a famine over all the land, they went down into Egypt, and there for four hundred years were so multiplied, that the army of them could not be numbered.
<br>10	And when the king of Egypt oppressed them, and made slaves of them to labour in clay
<br> 
<br>and brick, in the building of his cities, they cried to their Lord, and he struck the whole land of Egypt with divers plagues.
<br>11	And when the Egyptians had cast them out from them, and the plague had ceased from them, and they had a mind to take them again, and bring them back to their service,
<br>12	The God of heaven opened the sea to them in their flight, so that the waters were made to stand firm as a wall on either side, and they walked through the bottom of the sea and passed it dry foot.
<br>13	And when an innumerable army of the Egyptians pursued after them in that place, they were so overwhelmed with the waters, that there was not one left, to tell what had happened to posterity.
<br>14	After they came out of the Red Sea, they abode in the deserts of mount Sina, in which never man could dwell, or son of man rested.
<br>15	There bitter fountains were made sweet for them to drink, and for forty years they received food from heaven.
