<br>
<br>(II) any quarter or month, or
<br>
<br>(III) its own fiscal year,
<br>
<br> if the goods were produced during the fiscal year, quarter, or month that is the basis for the calculation;
<br>
<br>(ii) determine the average referred to in clause (i) separately for such goods sold to 1 or more motor vehicle producers; or
<br>
<br>(iii) make a separate determination under clause (i) or (ii) for automotive goods that are exported to the territory of one or more of the CAFTA–DR countries.
<br>(E) Calculating net cost
<br>
<br>The importer, exporter, or producer shall, consistent with the provisions regarding allocation of costs set out in generally accepted accounting principles, determine the net cost of an automotive good under subparagraph (B) by—

<br>(ii) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating the total cost to the automotive good, and then subtracting any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the automotive good; or
<br>
<br>(iii) reasonably allocating each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the automotive good so that the aggregate of all such costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, or nonallowable interest costs.
<br>(d) Value of materials
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For the purpose of calculating the regional value-content of a good under subsection (c), and for purposes of applying the de minimis rules under subsection (f), the value of a material is—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a material that is imported by the producer of the good, the adjusted value of the material;
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a material acquired in the territory in which the good is produced, the value, determined in accordance with Articles 1 through 8, Article 15, and the corresponding interpretive notes of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 referred to in section 3511(d)(8) of this title, as set forth in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury providing for the application of such Articles in the absence of an importation; or
