<br>SUBCHAPTER I—ECONOMIC AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR AFGHANISTAN
<br>§7511. Declaration of policy
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following declarations:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States and the international community should support efforts that advance the development of democratic civil authorities and institutions in Afghanistan and the establishment of a new broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, and fully representative government in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>(2) The United States, in particular, should provide its expertise to meet immediate humanitarian and refugee needs, fight the production and flow of illicit narcotics, and aid in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>(3) By promoting peace and security in Afghanistan and preventing a return to conflict, the United States and the international community can help ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a source for international terrorism.
<br>
<br>(4) The United States should support the objectives agreed to on December 5, 2001, in Bonn, Germany, regarding the provisional arrangement for Afghanistan as it moves toward the establishment of permanent institutions and, in particular, should work intensively toward ensuring the future neutrality of Afghanistan, establishing the principle that neighboring countries and other countries in the region do not threaten or interfere in one another's sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence, including supporting diplomatic initiatives to support this goal.
<br>
<br>(5) The special emergency situation in Afghanistan, which from the perspective of the American people combines security, humanitarian, political, law enforcement, and development imperatives, requires that the President should receive maximum flexibility in designing, coordinating, and administering efforts with respect to assistance for Afghanistan and that a temporary special program of such assistance should be established for this purpose.
<br>
<br>(6) To foster stability and democratization and to effectively eliminate the causes of terrorism, the United States and the international community should also support efforts that advance the development of democratic civil authorities and institutions in the broader Central Asia region.

<br>
<br>"(a) Congressional Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is vital to the national security of the United States and to combating international terrorism.
<br>
<br>"(2) Following the ouster of the Taliban regime in 2001, the Government of Afghanistan, with assistance from the United States and the international community, has achieved some notable successes, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) adopting a constitution;
<br>
<br>"(B) holding presidential, parliamentary, and provincial council elections;
<br>
<br>"(C) improving the protection of human rights, including women's rights; and
<br>
<br>"(D) expanding educational opportunities.
<br>
<br>"(3) The following factors pose a serious and immediate threat to the stability of Afghanistan:
<br>
<br>"(A) Taliban and anti-government forces, al Qaeda, and criminal networks.
<br>
<br>"(B) Drug trafficking and corruption.
<br>
<br>"(C) Weak institutions of administration, security, and justice, including pervasive lack of the rule of law.
<br>
<br>"(D) Poverty, unemployment, and lack of provision of basic services.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States and the international community must significantly increase political, economic, and military support to Afghanistan to ensure its long-term stability and prosperity, and to deny violent extremist groups such as al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>"(b) Statements of Policy.—The following shall be the policies of the United States:
<br>
<br>"(1) The United States shall vigorously support the people and Government of Afghanistan as they continue to commit to the path toward a government representing and protecting the rights of all Afghans, and shall maintain its long-term commitment to the people of Afghanistan by increased assistance and the continued deployment of United States troops in Afghanistan as long as the Government of Afghanistan supports such United States involvement.
<br>
<br>"(2) In order to reduce the ability of the Taliban and al Qaeda to finance their operations through the opium trade, the President shall engage aggressively with the Government of Afghanistan, countries in the region or otherwise influenced by the trade and transit of narcotics, as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners of the United States, and in consultation with Congress, to assess the success of the current Afghan counter-narcotics strategy and to explore additional options for addressing the narcotics crisis in Afghanistan, including possible changes in rules of engagement for NATO and Coalition forces for participation in actions against narcotics trafficking and kingpins, and the provision of comprehensive assistance to farmers who rely on opium for their livelihood, including through the promotion of alternative crops and livelihoods.
<br>
<br>"(3) The United States shall continue to work with and provide assistance to the Government of Afghanistan to strengthen local and national government institutions and the rule of law, including the training of judges and prosecutors, and to train and equip the Afghan National Security Forces.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States shall continue to call on NATO members participating in operations in Afghanistan to meet their commitments to provide forces and equipment, and to lift restrictions on how such forces can be deployed.
<br>
<br>"(5) The United States shall continue to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan by taking the following actions:
<br>
<br>"(A) Facilitating greater communication, including through official mechanisms such as the Tripartite Commission and the Joint Intelligence Operations Center, and by promoting other forms of exchange between the parliaments and civil society of the two countries.
<br>
<br>"(B) Urging the Government of Afghanistan to enter into a political dialogue with Pakistan with respect to all issues relating to the border between the two countries, with the aim of establishing a mutually-recognized and monitored border, open to human and economic exchange, and with both countries fully responsible for border security.
<br>
<br>"(c) Statement of Congress.—Congress strongly urges that the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) be reauthorized and updated to take into account new developments in Afghanistan and in the region so as to demonstrate the continued support by the United States for the people and Government of Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>"(d) Emergency Increase in Effective Police Training and Policing Operations.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Congressional finding.—Congress finds that police training programs in Afghanistan have achieved far less return on substantial investment to date and require a substantive review and justification of the means and purposes of such assistance, consequent to any provision of additional resources.
<br>
<br>"(2) Assistance authorized.—The President shall make increased efforts, on an urgent basis, to—
<br>
<br>"(A) dramatically improve the capability and effectiveness of United States and international police trainers, mentors, and police personnel for police training programs in Afghanistan, as well as develop a pretraining screening program;
<br>
<br>"(B) increase the numbers of such trainers, mentors, and personnel only if such increase is determined to improve the performance and capabilities of the Afghanistan civil security forces; and
<br>
<br>"(C) assist the Government of Afghanistan, in conjunction with the Afghanistan civil security forces and their leadership, in addressing the corruption crisis that is threatening to undermine Afghanistan's future.
<br>
<br>"(3) Report.—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 3, 2007], and every 6 months thereafter until September 30, 2010, the President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on United States efforts to fulfill the requirements of this subsection.

<br>Relief for Afghan Women and Children
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–81, Dec. 12, 2001, 115 Stat. 811, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) In Afghanistan, Taliban restrictions on women's participation in society make it nearly impossible for women to exercise their basic human rights. The Taliban restrictions on Afghan women's freedom of expression, association, and movement deny women full participation in society and, consequently, from effectively securing basic access to work, education, and health care.
<br>
<br>"(2) Afghanistan has one of the highest infant (165 of 1000) and child (257 of 1000) mortality rates in the world.
<br>
<br>"(3) Only 5 percent of rural and 39 percent of urban Afghans have access to safe drinking water.
<br>
<br>"(4) It is estimated that 42 percent of all deaths in Afghanistan are due to diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated food and water.
<br>
<br>"(5) Over one-third of Afghan children under 5 years of age suffer from malnutrition, 85,000 of whom die annually.
<br>
<br>"(6) Seventy percent of the health care system in Afghanistan is dependent on foreign assistance.
<br>
<br>"(7) As of May 1998, only 20 percent of hospital medical and surgical beds dedicated to adults were available for women, and thousands of Afghan women and girls are routinely denied health care.
<br>
<br>"(8) Women are forbidden to leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative. This prevents many women from seeking basic necessities like health care and food for their children. Doctors, virtually all of whom are male, are also not permitted to provide certain types of care not deemed appropriate by the Taliban.
<br>
<br>"(9) Before the Taliban took control of Kabul, schools were coeducational, with women accounting for 70 percent of the teaching force. Women represented about 50 percent of the civil service corps, and 40 percent of the city's physicians were women. Today, the Taliban prohibits women from working as teachers, doctors, and in any other occupation.
<br>
<br>"(10) The Taliban prohibit [sic] girls and women from attending school. In 1998, the Taliban ordered the closing of more than 100 privately funded schools where thousands of young women and girls were receiving education and training in skills that would have helped them support themselves and their families.
<br>
<br>"(11) Of the many tens of thousands of war widows in Afghanistan, many are forced to beg for food and to sell their possessions because they are not allowed to work.
<br>
<br>"(12) Resistance movements courageously continue to educate Afghan girls in secrecy and in foreign countries against Taliban law.
<br>"SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Subject to subsection (b), the President is authorized, on such terms and conditions as the President may determine, to provide educational and health care assistance for the women and children living in Afghanistan and as refugees in neighboring countries.
<br>
<br>"(b) Implementation.—(1) In providing assistance under subsection (a), the President shall ensure that such assistance is provided in a manner that protects and promotes the human rights of all people in Afghanistan, utilizing indigenous institutions and nongovernmental organizations, especially women's organizations, to the extent possible.
<br>
<br>"(2) Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 12, 2001], and at least annually for the 2 years thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives describing the activities carried out under this Act and otherwise describing the condition and status of women and children in Afghanistan and the persons in refugee camps while United States aid is given to displaced Afghans.
<br>
<br>"(c) Availability of Funds.—Funds made available under the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States (Public Law 107–38) [115 Stat. 220], shall be available to carry out this Act."
