<br>
<br>(II) a procedure for more detailed and frequent safety inspections;
<br>
<br>(vi) a requirement that all inspections be performed under the supervision of a State-registered professional engineer with related experience in dam design and construction;
<br>
<br>(vii) the authority to issue notices, when appropriate, to require owners of dams to perform necessary maintenance or remedial work, install and monitor instrumentation, improve security, revise operating procedures, or take other actions, including breaching dams when necessary;
