In a communication dated Nov. 6, 1940, the Director of the Geological Survey explained that the words "Coast and Interior Survey" were inadvertently incorporated upon authority of report contained in Senate Misc. Doc. No. 9, 45th Congress, 3d Session, which recommended the "Coast and Geodetic Survey" be changed to "United States Coast and Interior Survey" and an organization be created in the Interior Department to be known as the "United States Geological Survey." Congress adopted only the latter suggestion.
