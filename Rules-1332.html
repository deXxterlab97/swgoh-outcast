<br>(Pub. L. 102–325, title XIII, §1311, July 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 798.)
<br>§3302. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;
<br>
<br>(2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;
<br>
<br>(3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;
<br>
<br>(4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
<br>
<br>(5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;
<br>
<br>(6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and
<br>
<br>(7) these services are part of the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.

<br>An Indian tribe which has qualified under subsection (a) or (b) for a grant under this subchapter for any fiscal year shall continue to be eligible for such a grant for each succeeding fiscal year unless the Secretary revokes such eligibility for a cause described in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Causes for loss of eligibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary may revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter if such tribe—
<br>
<br>(A) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual financial statement that reports revenues and expenditures determined by use of an accounting system, established by the tribe, that complies with generally accepted accounting principles;
<br>
<br>(B) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual program description, stating the number of students served, and containing such information concerning such students, their educational programs and progress, and the financial assistance distributed to such students as the Secretary may require by regulation;
<br>
<br>(C) fails to submit to the Secretary a biennial financial audit conducted in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31; or
<br>
<br>(D) fails, in an evaluation of its financial assistance program conducted by an impartial third party entity, to comply with standards under this subchapter relating to (i) eligible students, programs, or institutions of higher education, (ii) satisfactory progress, or (iii) allowable administrative costs; as determined under contracts applicable to programs to provide financial assistance to individual Indian students for the cost of attendance at institutions of higher education administered by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] and in effect on January 20, 1991.
<br>(3) Procedures for revocation of eligibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter except—

<br>(A) after notice in writing to the tribe of the cause and opportunity to the tribe to correct;
<br>
<br>(B) providing technical assistance to the tribe in making such corrections; and

<br>(a) Allocation of funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall continue to determine the amount of program funds to be received by each grantee under this subchapter by the same method used for determining such distribution in fiscal year 1991 for tribally-administered and Bureau-administered programs of grants to individual Indians to defray postsecondary expenses.
<br>(2) Administrative costs
<br>
<br>In addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1), a grantee which has exercised the option given in section 3304(a) of this title to administer the program under a grant shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the method used by the grantee during the preceding contract period. All other grantees shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the regulations governing such determinations under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], as in effect at the time of application to grants being made.
<br>(3) Single grant; separate accounts

<br>(b) Use of funds
<br>
<br>Funds provided by grants under this subchapter shall be used—
<br>
<br>(1) to make grants to individual Indian students to meet, on the basis of need, any educational expense of attendance in a postsecondary education program (as determined under the contracts applying to the postsecondary education program administered by tribes under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93–638) [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.]), to the extent that such expense is not met from other sources or cannot be defrayed through the action of any State, Federal, or municipal Act, except that nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring any priority in consideration of resources; and
<br>
<br>(2) costs of administering the program under this subchapter, except that no more may be spent on administration of such program than is generated by the method for administrative cost computation specified in subsection (a)(2).

<br>(a) Terms of agreements
<br>
<br>A critical area service agreement shall be an agreement between an Indian student who receives or who shall receive federally funded higher education assistance and an Indian tribe or tribal organization providing such assistance in which the student agrees—
<br>
<br>(1) to undertake a course of study at an eligible institution (as that term is defined in section 1085(a) of title 20) in an area of critical need, as determined under section 3323 of this title, and to pursue that course of study to its completion; and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) to perform, for each academic year for which the student receives federally funded higher education assistance under a critical area service agreement, one calendar year of service to the tribe or organization in an occupation that is in a critical area designated by the tribe pursuant to section 3323(b) 1 of this title, commencing not later than 6 months after the student ceases to carry at an institution of higher education at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload as determined by the institution; or
<br>
<br>(B) to repay such assistance to the Secretary, together with interest thereon at a rate prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, in monthly or quarterly installments over not more than 5 years.
<br>(b) Service limitations and conditions
<br>
<br>The tribe or tribal organization shall agree that a student performing services under a critical area service agreement—
<br>
<br>(1) shall be provided compensation, benefits, and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as any other employee working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work;
<br>
<br>(2) may be treated as providing services to the tribe or organization if the student provides services for members of the tribe or organization that are approved by the tribe or organization and agreed to by the student even though such services are performed while the student is employed by a Federal, State, or local agency or instrumentality or by a nonprofit or for-profit private institution or organization; and
<br>
<br>(3) may obtain the benefits of a waiver or suspension in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c).
<br>(c) Waiver and suspension of service agreement
<br>(1) Waiver
<br>
<br>An Indian tribe or tribal organization may, by formal action, waive the service agreement of an Indian student for just cause, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The tribe or organization shall notify the Secretary in writing of any waiver granted under this subsection.
<br>(2) Suspension
<br>
<br>The obligation of a student to perform services under a critical area service agreement—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be suspended for not more than 18 months if, at the request of the student, the tribe or organization determines that there are no employment opportunities available in any critical service area; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall be suspended if the student ceases to attend an institution of higher education as a consequence of an institutional determination of unsatisfactory performance.
<br>
<br>If, at the end of a period of suspension under subparagraph (A), there are still no employment opportunities available in any critical service area, the student's obligations under the agreement shall terminate. A suspension under subparagraph (B) shall be reviewed by the tribe or organization annually, but may be continued indefinitely.
<br>(d) Pro rata reduction for partial services
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, provide for the pro rata reduction of repayment obligations under subsection (a)(2) in the case of any student who partially completes the service obligation of that student under subsection (a)(2)(A).
<br>(e) Certification of service

<br>(1) shall establish procedures for monitoring and evaluating the provisions of this subchapter, and provide a copy of such procedures to the Secretary and to each individual providing services under a critical area service agreement;
<br>
