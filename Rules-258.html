<br>
<br>The Administrator shall ensure that—

<br>
<br>(2) all high-risk urban areas and other recipients of grants administered by the Department to prevent, prepare for, protect against, or respond to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other man-made disasters (excluding assistance provided under section 203, title IV, or title V of the Robert T.

<br>(b) Planning committees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any State or high-risk urban area receiving a grant under section 604 or 605 of this title shall establish a State planning committee or urban area working group to assist in preparation and revision of the State, regional, or local homeland security plan or the threat and hazard identification and risk assessment, as the case may be, and to assist in determining effective funding priorities for grants under such sections.

<br>(c) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that the Nation is most effectively able to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters—
<br>
<br>(1) the Department should administer a coherent and coordinated system of both terrorism-focused and all-hazards grants;
<br>
<br>(2) there should be a continuing and appropriate balance between funding for terrorism-focused and all-hazards preparedness, as reflected in the authorizations of appropriations for grants under the amendments made by titles I and II, as applicable, of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; and
<br>
<br>(3) with respect to terrorism-focused grants, it is necessary to ensure both that the target capabilities of the highest risk areas are achieved quickly and that basic levels of preparedness, as measured by the attainment of target capabilities, are achieved nationwide.

<br>If an expedited approval facility does not agree to include in its site security plan specific additional security measures recommended by the Secretary under subclause (II)(aa), or does not submit a new or modified site security plan in accordance with subclause (III), the Secretary may revoke the certification of the facility by issuing an order under section 624(a)(1)(B) of this title.
<br>(bb) Effect of revocation
<br>
<br>If the Secretary revokes the certification of an expedited approval facility under item (aa) by issuing an order under section 624(a)(1)(B) of this title—
<br>
<br>(AA) the order shall require the owner or operator of the facility to submit a site security plan or alternative security program for review by the Secretary review 1 under subsection (c)(1); and
<br>
<br>(BB) the facility shall no longer be eligible to certify a site security plan under this paragraph.
<br>(V) Facial deficiency
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that a new or modified site security plan submitted by an expedited approval facility under subclause (III) is facially deficient—
<br>
<br>(aa) not later than 120 days after the date of the determination, the owner or operator of the facility shall submit a site security plan or alternative security program for review by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1); and
<br>
<br>(bb) the facility shall no longer be eligible to certify a site security plan under this paragraph.
<br>(H) Templates
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may develop prescriptive site security plan templates with specific security measures to meet the risk-based performance standards under subsection (a)(2)(C) for adoption and certification by a covered chemical facility assigned to tier 3 or 4 in lieu of developing and certifying its own plan.
<br>(ii) Applicability of other laws to development and issuance of initial site security plan templates and related guidance
<br>
<br>During the period before the Secretary has met the deadline under subparagraph (B)(i),2 in developing and issuing, or amending, the site security plan templates under this subparagraph, in issuing guidance for implementation of the templates, and in collecting information from expedited approval facilities, the Secretary shall not be subject to—
<br>
<br>(I) section 553 of title 5;

<br>
<br>(ii) ensure that any duties carried out by a nongovernmental entity are not inherently governmental functions.
<br>(2) Personnel surety
<br>(A) Personnel surety program
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish and carry out a Personnel Surety Program that—

<br>(i) does not require an owner or operator of a covered chemical facility that voluntarily participates in the program to submit information about an individual more than 1 time;
<br>
<br>(ii) provides a participating owner or operator of a covered chemical facility with relevant information about an individual based on vetting the individual against the terrorist screening database, to the extent that such feedback is necessary for the facility to be in compliance with regulations promulgated under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provides redress to an individual—
<br>
<br>(I) whose information was vetted against the terrorist screening database under the program; and
<br>
<br>(II) who believes that the personally identifiable information submitted to the Department for such vetting by a covered chemical facility, or its designated representative, was inaccurate.
<br>(B) Personnel surety program implementation
<br>
<br>To the extent that a risk-based performance standard established under subsection (a) requires identifying individuals with ties to terrorism—
<br>
<br>(i) a covered chemical facility—
<br>
<br>(I) may satisfy its obligation under the standard by using any Federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the terrorist screening database, or any successor program, including the Personnel Surety Program established under subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(II) shall—
<br>
<br>(aa) accept a credential from a Federal screening program described in subclause (I) if an individual who is required to be screened presents such a credential; and
<br>
<br>(bb) address in its site security plan or alternative security program the measures it will take to verify that a credential or documentation from a Federal screening program described in subclause (I) is current;
<br>
<br>(ii) visual inspection shall be sufficient to meet the requirement under clause (i)(II)(bb), but the facility should consider other means of verification, consistent with the facility's assessment of the threat posed by acceptance of such credentials; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary may not require a covered chemical facility to submit any information about an individual unless the individual—
<br>
<br>(I) is to be vetted under the Personnel Surety Program; or
<br>
<br>(II) has been identified as presenting a terrorism security risk.
<br>(C) Rights unaffected
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall supersede the ability—
<br>
<br>(i) of a facility to maintain its own policies regarding the access of individuals to restricted areas or critical assets; or

<br>(1) Identification of chemical facilities of interest
<br>
<br>In carrying out this subchapter, the Secretary shall consult with the heads of other Federal agencies, States and political subdivisions thereof, relevant business associations, and public and private labor organizations to identify all chemical facilities of interest.
<br>(2) Risk assessment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary shall develop a security risk assessment approach and corresponding tiering methodology for covered chemical facilities that incorporates the relevant elements of risk, including threat, vulnerability, and consequence.
<br>(B) Criteria for determining security risk
<br>
<br>The criteria for determining the security risk of terrorism associated with a covered chemical facility shall take into account—
<br>
<br>(i) relevant threat information;
<br>
<br>(ii) potential severe economic consequences and the potential loss of human life in the event of the facility being subject to attack, compromise, infiltration, or exploitation by terrorists; and
<br>
<br>(iii) vulnerability of the facility to attack, compromise, infiltration, or exploitation by terrorists.
<br>(3) Changes in tiering
<br>(A) Maintenance of records
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall document the basis for each instance in which—

<br>(aa) placed a covered chemical facility in a lower risk tier; or
<br>
<br>(bb) determined that a facility that had previously met the criteria for a covered chemical facility under section 621(3) of this title no longer met the criteria; and
<br>
<br>(II) the basis, in summary form, for each action or determination under subclause (I); and
<br>
<br>(ii) that is provided in a sufficiently anonymized form to ensure that the information does not identify any specific facility or company as the source of the information when viewed alone or in combination with other public information;
<br>
<br>(C) the average number of days spent reviewing site security or an alternative security program for a covered chemical facility prior to approval;
<br>
<br>(D) the number of covered chemical facilities inspected;
