To the extent that classified information is relevant to the proceeding or would be revealed in the determination of an issue, the court shall review such information in camera and ex parte, and shall issue any part of the court's written order that would reveal classified information in camera and ex parte and maintain such part under seal.

<br>(a) Short title
<br>
<br>This chapter may be cited as the "David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991".
<br>(b) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The security of the United States is and will continue to depend on the ability of the United States to exercise international leadership.
<br>
<br>(2) The ability of the United States to exercise international leadership is, and will increasingly continue to be, based on the political and economic strength of the United States, as well as on United States military strength around the world.
<br>
<br>(3) Recent changes in the world pose threats of a new kind to international stability as Cold War tensions continue to decline while economic competition, regional conflicts, terrorist activities, and weapon proliferations have dramatically increased.
<br>
<br>(4) The future national security and economic well-being of the United States will depend substantially on the ability of its citizens to communicate and compete by knowing the languages and cultures of other countries.
<br>
<br>(5) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that the employees of its departments and agencies with national security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges of this changing international environment.
<br>
<br>(6) The Federal Government also has an interest in taking actions to alleviate the problem of American undergraduate and graduate students being inadequately prepared to meet the challenges posed by increasing global interaction among nations.
<br>
<br>(7) American colleges and universities must place a new emphasis on improving the teaching of foreign languages, area studies, counterproliferation studies, and other international fields to help meet those challenges.
<br>(c) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) To provide the necessary resources, accountability, and flexibility to meet the national security education needs of the United States, especially as such needs change over time.
<br>
<br>(2) To increase the quantity, diversity, and quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the fields of foreign languages, area studies, counterproliferation studies, and other international fields that are critical to the Nation's interest.
<br>
<br>(3) To produce an increased pool of applicants for work in the departments and agencies of the United States Government with national security responsibilities.
<br>
<br>(4) To expand, in conjunction with other Federal programs, the international experience, knowledge base, and perspectives on which the United States citizenry, Government employees, and leaders rely.
<br>
<br>(5) To permit the Federal Government to advocate the cause of international education.

<br>
<br>(A) awarding scholarships to undergraduate students who—
<br>
<br>(i) are United States citizens in order to enable such students to study, for at least one academic semester or equivalent term, in foreign countries that are critical countries (as determined under section 1903(d)(4)(A) of this title) in those languages and study areas where deficiencies exist (as identified in the assessments undertaken pursuant to section 1906(d) of this title); and
<br>
<br>(ii) pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(A), enter into an agreement to work in a national security position or work in the field of higher education in the area of study for which the scholarship was awarded;

<br>
<br>(II) are not proficient at a professional level in the English language with respect to reading, writing, and other skills required to carry out the national security interests of the United States, as determined by the Secretary,
<br>
<br> to enable such students to pursue English language studies at an institution of higher education of the United States to attain proficiency in those skills; and
<br>
<br>(ii) enter into an agreement to work in a position in a similar manner (as determined by the Secretary) as agreements entered into pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(A).

<br>
<br>(1) will maintain satisfactory academic progress, as determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, and agrees that failure to maintain such progress shall constitute grounds upon which the Secretary or contract organization referred to in subsection (a)(4) may terminate such assistance;
<br>
<br>(2)(A) will (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in coordination with the heads of the other Federal departments and agencies concerned) begin work not later than three years after the recipient's completion of degree study during which scholarship assistance was provided under the program—

<br>
<br>(2) An undergraduate student who has been awarded a scholarship under subsection (a)(1)(A) or a graduate student who has been awarded a fellowship under subsection (a)(1)(B) may participate in the activities carried out under the National Flagship Language Initiative.
<br>
<br>(3) An institution of higher education that receives a grant pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(D) shall give special consideration to applicants who are employees of the Federal Government.

<br>(iii) if, before the completion by the employee of such training, the employment of the employee is terminated by such department or agency due to misconduct by the employee, or by the employee voluntarily, to reimburse the United States for the total cost of such training (excluding the employee's pay and allowances) provided to the employee; and
<br>
<br>(iv) if, after the completion by the employee of such training but before the completion by the employee of the period of service required by clause (ii), the employment of the employee by such department or agency is terminated either by such department or agency due to misconduct by the employee, or by the employee voluntarily, to reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total cost of such training (excluding the employee's pay and allowances) provided to the employee as the unserved portion of such period of service bears to the total period of service required by clause (ii).
<br>
<br>(C) 1 Subject to subparagraph (D), the obligation to reimburse the United States under an agreement under subparagraph (A) is for all purposes a debt owing the United States.
<br>
<br>(D) The head of the element of the intelligence community concerned may release an employee, in whole or in part, from the obligation to reimburse the United States under an agreement under subparagraph (A) when, in the discretion of the head of the element, the head of the element determines that equity or the interests of the United States so require.
