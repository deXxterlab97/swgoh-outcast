<br>1501(f) 	41:422(e). 	
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the text of 41:422(a)(2)(C) is omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2)(A), the last sentence is substituted for "of the initial members, two shall be appointed for terms of two years, one shall be appointed for a term of three years, and one shall be appointed for a term of four years" because the initial members have already been appointed.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(2), the reference to section 5376 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to grade GS–18 of the General Schedule because of section 529 [title I, §101(c)(1)] of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101–509, 104 Stat. 1442, 5:5376 note).
<br>
<br>In subsection (f)(1), the words "Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section" are omitted because 41:422(a) does not provide any relevant exception.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f)(2), the words "private sector" are substituted for "private life" for consistency with subsection (b)(1)(B) of the revised section.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f)(3), the words "Executive Schedule" are substituted for "Federal Executive Salary Schedule under section 5316 of title 5" for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>Senate Revision Amendment
<br>
<br>In subsec. (c)(2), "for level IV of the Executive Schedule" substituted for "under section 5376 of title 5" by S. Amdt. 4726 (111th Cong.). See 156 Cong. Rec. 18682 (2010).

<br>
<br>"(2) Paragraph (1) requires only a change of the statement of a threshold condition in the regulation referred to by section number in that paragraph, and shall not be construed as—
<br>
<br>"(A) a ratification or expression of approval of—
<br>
<br>"(i) any aspect of the regulation; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) the manner in which section 26 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act [now 41 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] is administered through the regulation; or
<br>
<br>"(B) a requirement to apply the regulation.
<br>
<br>"(d) Implementation.—The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall ensure that this section [see Tables for classification] and the amendments made by this section are implemented in a manner that ensures that the Federal Government can recover costs, as appropriate, in a case in which noncompliance with cost accounting standards, or a change in the cost accounting system of a contractor segment or subcontractor segment that is not determined to be desirable by the Federal Government, results in a shift of costs from contracts that are not covered by the cost accounting standards to contracts that are covered by the cost accounting standards.
<br>
<br>"(e) Implementation of Requirements for Revision of Regulations.—(1) Final regulations required by subsection (c) shall be issued not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 5, 1999].
<br>
<br>"(2) Subsection (c) shall cease to be effective one year after the date on which final regulations issued in accordance with that subsection take effect.
<br>
<br>"(g) Inapplicability of Standards to Certain Contracts.—The cost accounting standards issued pursuant to section 26(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([former] 41 U.S.C. 422(f)) [now 41 U.S.C. 1502(a), (b)], as amended by this section, shall not apply during fiscal year 2000 with respect to a contract entered into under the authority provided in chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code (relating to health benefits for Federal employees).
<br>
<br>"(h) Construction Regarding Certain Not-For-Profit Entities.—The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) [see Tables for classification] shall not be construed as modifying or superseding, nor as intended to impair or restrict, the applicability of the cost accounting standards described in section 26(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([former] 41 U.S.C. 422(f)) [now 41 U.S.C. 1502(a), (b)] to—
<br>
<br>"(1) any educational institution or federally funded research and development center that is associated with an educational institution in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A–21, as in effect on January 1, 1999; or
<br>
<br>"(2) any contract with a nonprofit entity that provides research and development and related products or services to the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>"(i) Effective Date.—The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) [see Tables for classification] shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 5, 1999], and shall apply with respect to—
<br>
<br>"(1) contracts that are entered into on or after such effective date; and
<br>
<br>"(2) determinations made on or after such effective date regarding whether a segment of a contractor or subcontractor is subject to the cost accounting standards under section 26(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([former] 41 U.S.C. 422(f)) [now 41 U.S.C. 1502(a), (b)], regardless of whether the contracts on which such determinations are made were entered into before, on, or after such date."
<br>§1503. Contract price adjustment
<br>
<br>(a) Disagreement Constitutes a Dispute.—If the Federal Government and a contractor or subcontractor fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute under chapter 71 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Amount of Adjustment.—A contract price adjustment undertaken under section 1502(f)(2) of this title shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the Federal Government and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the Federal Government from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs, as defined by the Cost Accounting Standards Board. The Federal Government may not recover costs greater than the aggregate increased cost to the Federal Government, as defined by the Board, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(c) Interest.—The interest rate applicable to a contract price adjustment is the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621) for the period. Interest accrues from the time payments of the increased costs were made to the contractor or subcontractor to the time the Federal Government receives full compensation for the price adjustment.

<br>
<br>(c) Ensure that procurement organizations focus on measurable results and on increased attention to understanding and meeting customer needs;

<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>Sec. 3.

<br>
<br>(c) Identifying desirable Government-wide procurement system criteria; and
