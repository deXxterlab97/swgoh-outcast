<br>(i) a member of the Service,
<br>
<br>(ii) an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency entitled to retirement credit under title II of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act (50 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) or under section 302(a) or 303(b) of that Act (50 U.S.C. 2152(a), 2153(b)), or
<br>
<br>(iii) a participant as a Member of Congress, a congressional employee, law enforcement officer, firefighter, or air traffic controller in the Civil Service Retirement System under subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, or in the Federal Employees' Retirement System under chapter 84 of title 5; and
<br>
<br>(B) at the rate stated in section 8415(a) of title 5 for all other service creditable under this System including service in excess of 20 years otherwise creditable under paragraph (A).
<br>
<br>(3) Any participant who is involuntarily retired or separated under section 4007, 4008, 4010, or 4010a of this title and who would if a participant under part I, become eligible for a refund of contributions or a deferred annuity under part I, shall, in lieu thereof, receive benefits for an involuntary separation under this part.
<br>
<br>(4) A disability annuity under this part required to be redetermined under section 8452(b) of title 5, or computed under section 8452(c) or (d) of such title 5, shall be recomputed or computed using the formula in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section rather than section 8415 of such title 5 (as stated in section 8452(b)(2)(A) and 8452(c) and (d) of such title). Such annuity shall also be computed in accordance with the preceding sentence if, as of the day on which such annuity commences or is restored, the annuitant satisfies the age and service requirements for entitlement to an immediate annuity under section 4051 of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) A former participant entitled to a deferred annuity under section 8413(b) of title 5 shall not be subject to section 8415(g)(1) of such title 5 if the former participant has 20 years of service creditable under this part and is at least 50 years of age as of the date on which the annuity is to commence.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The amount of a survivor annuity for a widow or widower of a participant or former participant shall be 50 percent of an annuity computed for the deceased under this part rather than under section 8415 of such title 5 (as stated in sections 8442(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and (c)(2) of such title).

<br>(B) Any calculation for a widow or widower of a participant or former participant under section 8442(f)(2)(A) shall be based on an "assumed FSRDS annuity" rather than an "assumed CSRS annuity" as stated in such section.

<br>(c) Annuity supplement
<br>
<br>A participant who is entitled to an immediate annuity under subsection (b) shall be entitled to receive an annuity supplement while the annuitant is under 62 years of age.

<br>(d) Separation for cause based on disloyalty
<br>
<br>Any participant who is separated for cause under section 4010 of this title shall not be entitled to an annuity under this System when the Secretary determines that the separation was based in whole or in part on disloyalty to the United States.

<br>
<br>(B) The period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the period which begins on the first day of the month following the month in which the divorce or annulment becomes final and ends on the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age.

<br>A participant or former participant may not make any election or modification of election under section 8417, 8418, or 8433 of title 5 or other section relating to the participant's account in the Thrift Savings Plan or annuity under the basic plan that would diminish the entitlement of a former spouse to any benefit granted to the former spouse by this section or in a current spousal agreement.

<br>
<br>If a member becomes a participant under this part after qualifying for benefits under part I and, at the time of transfer, has a former spouse entitled to benefits under part I which are determined under section 4054 or 4055 of this title (as determined by the Secretary of State) and are similar in amount to a pro rata share division under section 4054 or 4055 of this title and the service of the member as a participant under this part is not recognized in determining that pro rata share, then subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to such former spouse. Otherwise, subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall apply.
<br>(e) Death of participant entitled to deferred annuity; spousal agreement; payment of survivor annuity
<br>
<br>If a participant dies after completing at least 18 months of service or a former participant dies entitled to a deferred annuity, but before becoming eligible to receive the annuity, and such participant or former participant has left with the Secretary of State a spousal agreement promising a share of a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, chapter 84, title 5, to a former spouse, such survivor annuity shall be paid under the terms of this part as if the survivor annuity had been ordered by a court.
