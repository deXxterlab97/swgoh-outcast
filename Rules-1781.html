<br>§1720. Transfers for nursing home care; adult day health care
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may transfer to a non-Department nursing home, for care at the expense of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) a veteran—
<br>
<br>(i) who has been furnished care by the Secretary in a facility under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) who the Secretary determines—
<br>
<br>(I) requires a protracted period of nursing home care which can be furnished in the non-Department nursing home; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a veteran who has been furnished hospital care in a facility under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary, has received maximum benefits from such care; and
<br>
<br>(B) a member of the Armed Forces—
<br>
<br>(i) who has been furnished care in a hospital of the Armed Forces;

<br>
<br>(iii) who upon discharge from the Armed Forces will become a veteran.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may transfer a person to a nursing home under this subsection only if the Secretary determines that the cost to the United States of the care of such person in the nursing home will not exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount equal to 45 percent of the cost of care furnished by the Department in a general hospital under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary (as such cost may be determined annually by the Secretary); or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount equal to 50 percent of such cost, if such higher amount is determined to be necessary by the Secretary (upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health) to provide adequate care.
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a veteran—
<br>
<br>(i) who is transferred to a non-Department nursing home from a hospital under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) whose hospitalization was primarily for a service-connected disability;
<br>
<br>(B) in a case in which the nursing home care is required for a service-connected disability; or
<br>
<br>(C) in a case in which, in the judgment of the Secretary, a longer period of nursing home care is warranted.
<br>
<br>(4) A veteran who is furnished care by the Secretary in a hospital or domiciliary facility in Alaska or Hawaii may be furnished nursing home care at the expense of the United States under this subsection even if such hospital or domiciliary facility is not under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(b) No veteran may be transferred or admitted to any institution for nursing home care under this section, unless such institution is determined by the Secretary to meet such standards as the Secretary may prescribe.

<br>
<br>(c)(1)(A) In furnishing nursing home care, adult day health care, or other extended care services under this section, the Secretary may enter into agreements for furnishing such care or services with—

<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of the medicaid program, a provider participating under a State plan under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and

<br>(B) In entering into an agreement under subparagraph (A) with a provider of services described in clause (i) of that subparagraph or a provider described in clause (ii) of that subparagraph, the Secretary may use the procedures available for entering into provider agreements under section 1866(a) of the Social Security Act.
<br>
<br>(2) In applying the provisions of section 6704(a) of title 41 with respect to any contract entered into under this section to provide nursing home care of veterans, the payment of wages not less than those specified in section 6(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(b)) shall be deemed to constitute compliance with such provisions.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may authorize for any veteran requiring nursing home care for a service-connected disability direct admission for such care at the expense of the United States to any non-Department nursing home. The Secretary may also authorize a direct admission to such a nursing home for nursing home care for any veteran who has been discharged from a hospital under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary and who is currently receiving medical services as part of home health services from the Department.
<br>
<br>(2) Direct admission authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection may be authorized upon determination of need therefor—
<br>
<br>(A) by a physician employed by the Department; or
<br>
<br>(B) in areas where no such physician is available, by a physician carrying out such function under contract or fee arrangement,
<br>
<br>based on an examination by such physician.
<br>
<br>(3) The amount which may be paid for such care and the length of care available under this subsection shall be the same as authorized under subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) The cost of intermediate care for purposes of payment by the United States pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section shall be determined by the Secretary except that the rate of reimbursement shall be commensurately less than that provided for nursing home care.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of this section, the term "non-Department nursing home" means a public or private institution not under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary which furnishes nursing home care.
<br>
<br>(f)(1)(A) The Secretary may furnish adult day health care services to a veteran enrolled under section 1705(a) of this title who would otherwise require nursing home care.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may provide in-kind assistance (through the services of Department employees and the sharing of other Department resources) to a facility furnishing care to veterans under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Any such in-kind assistance shall be provided under a contract or agreement between the Secretary and the facility concerned. The Secretary may provide such assistance only for use solely in the furnishing of adult day health care and only if, under such contract or agreement, the Department receives reimbursement for the full cost of such assistance, including the cost of services and supplies and normal depreciation and amortization of equipment. Such reimbursement may be made by reduction in the charges to the United States or by payment to the United States. Any funds received through such reimbursement shall be credited to funds allotted to the Department facility that provided the assistance.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may conduct, at facilities over which the Secretary has direct jurisdiction, programs for the furnishing of adult day health care to veterans who are eligible for such care under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that necessary travel and incidental expenses (or transportation in lieu thereof) may be furnished under such a program only under the terms and conditions set forth in section 111 of this title. The furnishing of care under any such program shall be subject to the limitations that are applicable to the duration of adult day health care furnished under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(g) The Secretary may contract with appropriate entities to provide specialized residential care and rehabilitation services to a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who the Secretary determines suffers from a traumatic brain injury, has an accumulation of deficits in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, and because of these deficits, would otherwise require admission to a nursing home even though such care would generally exceed the veteran's nursing needs.

<br>
<br>(b) Upon receipt of an application for treatment and rehabilitative services under this title for an alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disability from any individual who has been discharged or released from active military, naval, air, or space service but who is not eligible for such treatment and services, the Secretary shall—

<br>Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health Care
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–387, title I, §§102–105, Oct. 10, 2008, 122 Stat. 4112–4114, provided that:
<br>"SEC. 102. FINDINGS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) More than 1,500,000 members of the Armed Forces have been deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The 2005 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Personnel reports that 23 percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use disorder, with similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use disorder among members of the National Guard.
<br>
<br>"(2) The effects of substance use disorder are wide ranging, including significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased risk of unemployment and homelessness.
<br>
<br>"(3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, chronic physical illness, and polytrauma may be at increased risk for development of a substance use disorder, treatment for these veterans is complicated by the need to address adequately the physical and mental symptoms associated with these conditions through appropriate medical intervention.
<br>
<br>"(4) While the Veterans Health Administration has dramatically increased health services for veterans from 1996 through 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized substance use disorder treatment services decreased 18 percent during that time. No comparable decrease in the national rate of substance use disorder has been observed during that time.
<br>
<br>"(5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health Administration provide exemplary substance use disorder treatment services, the availability of such treatment services throughout the health care system of the Veterans Health Administration is inconsistent.
<br>
<br>"(6) According to a 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation services between 1996 and 2006, and the Fiscal Year 2007 National Mental Health Program Monitoring System report shows that little progress has been made in restoring these services to their pre-1996 levels.
<br>"SEC. 103. EXPANSION OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure the provision of such services and treatment to each veteran enrolled in the health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs who is in need of services and treatments for a substance use disorder as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) Screening for substance use disorder in all settings, including primary care settings.
<br>
<br>"(2) Short term motivational counseling services.
<br>
<br>"(3) Marital and family counseling.
<br>
<br>"(4) Intensive outpatient or residential care services.
<br>
<br>"(5) Relapse prevention services.
<br>
<br>"(6) Ongoing aftercare and outpatient counseling services.
<br>
<br>"(7) Opiate substitution therapy services.
<br>
<br>"(8) Pharmacological treatments aimed at reducing craving for drugs and alcohol.
<br>
<br>"(9) Detoxification and stabilization services.
<br>
<br>"(10) Coordination with groups providing peer to peer counseling.
<br>
<br>"(11) Such other services as the Secretary considers appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(b) Provision of Services.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Allocation of resources for provision of services.—The Secretary shall ensure that amounts made available for care, treatment, and services provided under this section are allocated in such a manner that a full continuum of care, treatment, and services described in subsection (a) is available to veterans seeking such care, treatment, or services, without regard to the location of the residence of any such veterans.
<br>
<br>"(2) Manner of provision.—The services and treatment described in subsection (a) may be provided to a veteran described in such subsection—
<br>
<br>"(A) at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers or clinics;
<br>
<br>"(B) by referral to other facilities of the Department that are accessible to such veteran; or
<br>
<br>"(C) by contract or fee-for-service payments with community-based organizations for the provision of such services and treatments.
<br>
<br>"(c) Alternatives in Case of Services Denied Due to Clinical Necessity.—If the Secretary denies the provision to a veteran of services or treatment for a substance use disorder due to clinical necessity, the Secretary shall provide the veteran such other services or treatment as are medically appropriate.
<br>"SEC. 104. CARE FOR VETERANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—If the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides a veteran inpatient or outpatient care for a substance use disorder and a comorbid mental health disorder, the Secretary shall ensure that treatment for such disorders is provided concurrently—
<br>
<br>"(1) through a service provided by a clinician or health professional who has training and expertise in treatment of substance use disorders and mental health disorders;
<br>
<br>"(2) by separate substance use disorder and mental health disorder treatment services when there is appropriate coordination, collaboration, and care management between such treatment services; or
<br>
<br>"(3) by a team of clinicians with appropriate expertise.
<br>
<br>"(b) Team of Clinicians With Appropriate Expertise Defined.—In this section, the term 'team of clinicians with appropriate expertise' means a team consisting of the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Clinicians and health professionals with expertise in treatment of substance use disorders and mental health disorders who act in coordination and collaboration with each other.
<br>
<br>"(2) Such other professionals as the Secretary considers appropriate for the provision of treatment to veterans for substance use and mental health disorders.
<br>"SEC. 105. PILOT PROGRAM FOR INTERNET-BASED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FOR VETERANS OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental health disorders has been demonstrated to prevent some veterans from seeking such treatment at a medical facility operated by the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs.
<br>
<br>"(2) There is a significant incidence among veterans of post-deployment mental health problems, especially among members of a reserve component who return as veterans to civilian life.
<br>
<br>"(3) Computer-based self-guided training has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for supplementing the care of psychological conditions.
<br>
<br>"(4) Younger veterans, especially those who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, are comfortable with and proficient at computer-based technology.
<br>
<br>"(5) Veterans living in rural areas may find access to treatment for substance use disorder limited.
<br>
<br>"(6) Self-assessment and treatment options for substance use disorders through an Internet website may reduce stigma and provides additional access for individuals seeking care and treatment for such disorders.
<br>
<br>"(b) In General.—Not later than October 1, 2009, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing veterans who seek treatment for substance use disorders access to a computer-based self-assessment, education, and specified treatment program through a secure Internet website operated by the Secretary. Participation in the pilot program shall be available on a voluntary basis for those veterans who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.
<br>
<br>"(c) Elements of Pilot Program.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—In carrying out the pilot program under this section, the Secretary shall ensure that—
<br>
<br>"(A) access to the Internet website and the programs available on the website by a veteran (or family member) does not involuntarily generate an identifiable medical record of that access by that veteran in any medical database maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs;
<br>
<br>"(B) the Internet website is accessible from remote locations, especially rural areas; and
<br>
<br>"(C) the Internet website includes a self-assessment tool for substance use disorders, self-guided treatment and educational materials for such disorders, and appropriate information and materials for family members of veterans.
<br>
<br>"(2) Consideration of similar projects.—In designing the pilot program under this section, the Secretary shall consider similar pilot projects of the Department of Defense for the early diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions established under section 741 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act of [for] Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109–364; 120 Stat. 2304) [10 U.S.C. 1074 note].
<br>
<br>"(3) Location of pilot program.—The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program through those medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs that have established Centers for Excellence for Substance Abuse Treatment and Education or that have established a Substance Abuse Program Evaluation and Research Center.
<br>
<br>"(4) Contract authority.—The Secretary may enter into contracts with qualified entities or organizations to carry out the pilot program required under this section.
<br>
<br>"(d) Duration of Pilot Program.—The pilot program required by subsection (a) shall be carried out during the two-year period beginning on the date of the commencement of the pilot program.
<br>
<br>"(e) Report.—Not later than six months after the completion of the pilot program, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the pilot program, and shall include in that report—an assessment of the feasibility and advisability of continuing or expanding the pilot program, of any cost savings or other benefits associated with the pilot program, and any other recommendations.
<br>
<br>"(f) Authorization of Appropriations.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs $1,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011 to carry out the pilot program under this section."
