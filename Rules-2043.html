<br>(1) Temporary supplies
<br>
<br>Each temporary contract for the supply of water entered into pursuant to this section shall terminate no later than two years from the date of execution or upon a determination by the Secretary that water supply conditions no longer warrant that such contracts remain in effect, whichever occurs first. The costs associated with any such contract shall be repaid within the term of the contract.

<br>The price for project water, other than water purchased pursuant to section 2211(c) of this title, delivered under a temporary contract entered into by the Secretary under this section shall be at least sufficient to recover all Federal operation and maintenance costs and administrative costs, and an appropriate share of capital costs, including interest on such capital costs allocated to municipal and industrial water, except that, for project water delivered to nonproject landholdings, the price shall include full cost (as defined in section 202(3) of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (Public Law 97–293; 96 Stat. 1263; 43 U.S.C. 390bb) [43 U.S.C. 390bb(3)]). For all contracts entered into by the Secretary under the authority of this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(1) the interest rate used for computing interest during construction and interest on the unpaid balance of the capital costs expended pursuant to this chapter shall be at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of one year occurring during the last month of the fiscal year preceding the date of execution of the temporary contract; or
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of existing facilities the rate as authorized for that Federal Reclamation project; or
<br>
<br>(3) in the absence of such authorized rate, the interest rate as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which construction was initiated on the basis of the computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations which were neither due nor callable for redemption for fifteen years from date of issue: Provided, That for all deliveries of water for municipal and industrial purposes from existing facilities to nonproject contractors, the rate shall be as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>(d) Fish and wildlife
<br>
<br>The Secretary may make water from Federal Reclamation projects and nonproject water available on a nonreimbursable basis for the purposes of protecting or restoring fish and wildlife resources, including mitigation losses, that occur as a result of drought conditions or the operation of a Federal Reclamation project during drought conditions. The Secretary may store and convey project and nonproject water for fish and wildlife purposes, and may provide conveyance of any such water for both State and Federal wildlife habitat and for habitat held in private ownership. The Secretary may make available water for these purposes outside the authorized project service area. Use of the Federal storage and conveyance facilities for these purposes shall be on a nonreimbursable basis. Water made available by the Secretary in 1991 from the Central Valley Project, California, to the Grasslands Water District for the purpose of fish and wildlife shall be nonreimbursable.
<br>(e) Nonproject water
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to store and convey nonproject water utilizing Federal Reclamation project facilities for use outside and inside the authorized project service area for municipal and industrial uses, fish and wildlife, and agricultural uses. Except in the case of water supplied for fish and wildlife, which shall be nonreimbursable, the Secretary shall charge the recipients of such water for such use of Federal Reclamation project facilities at a rate established pursuant to subsection (c).

<br>        
<br>§2301. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to sell land identified for disposal under its land use planning;
<br>
<br>(2) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under that Act to exchange Federal land for non-Federal land if the exchange would be in the public interest;
<br>
<br>(3) through land use planning under that Act, the Bureau of Land Management has identified certain tracts of public land for disposal;
<br>
<br>(4) the Federal land management agencies of the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have authority under existing law to acquire land consistent with the mission of each agency;
<br>
<br>(5) the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal and the acquisition of certain non-Federal land from willing landowners would—
<br>
<br>(A) allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate resource management;
<br>
<br>(B) contribute to administrative efficiency within Federal land management units; and
<br>
<br>(C) allow for increased effectiveness of the allocation of fiscal and human resources within the Federal land management agencies;
<br>
<br>(6) a more expeditious process for disposal and acquisition of land, established to facilitate a more effective configuration of land ownership patterns, would benefit the public interest;
<br>
<br>(7) many private individuals own land within the boundaries of Federal land management units and desire to sell the land to the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(8) such land lies within national parks, national monuments, national wildlife refuges, national forests, and other areas designated for special management;
<br>
<br>(9) Federal land management agencies are facing increased workloads from rapidly growing public demand for the use of public land, making it difficult for Federal managers to address problems created by the existence of inholdings in many areas;
<br>
<br>(10) in many cases, inholders and the Federal Government would mutually benefit from Federal acquisition of the land on a priority basis;
<br>
<br>(11) proceeds generated from the disposal of public land may be properly dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings and other land that will improve the resource management ability of the Federal land management agencies and adjoining landowners;
<br>
<br>(12) using proceeds generated from the disposal of public land to purchase inholdings and other such land from willing sellers would enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies to—
<br>
<br>(A) work cooperatively with private landowners and State and local governments; and
<br>
<br>(B) promote consolidation of the ownership of public and private land in a manner that would allow for better overall resource management;
<br>
<br>(13) in certain locations, the sale of public land that has been identified for disposal is the best way for the public to receive fair market value for the land; and
<br>
<br>(14) to allow for the least disruption of existing land and resource management programs, the Bureau of Land Management may use non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents for agency review and approval consistent with applicable provisions of the Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisition.
