<br>
<br>(1) is entitled to basic pay;
<br>
<br>(2) has the current technical qualification for duty in connection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants; and
<br>
<br>(3) executes a written agreement to remain on active duty in connection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants for a period of not less than three years, so long as the new period of obligated active service does not extend beyond the end of 30 years of commissioned service, in addition to any other period of obligated active service.
<br>
<br>(b) Payment Amount; Payment Options.—(1) The total amount paid to an officer under an agreement under subsection (a) or (e)(1) may not exceed $30,000 for each year of the active-service agreement. Amounts paid under the agreement are in addition to all other compensation to which the officer is entitled.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall determine annually the necessity for continuance of the special pay and the rate of special pay per year for such active-service agreements accepted within each 12-month period.
<br>
<br>(3) Upon acceptance of an agreement under subsection (a) or (e)(1) by the Secretary, the total amount payable shall be paid in a single lump-sum or in annual installments of equal or different amounts over the length of the contract, commencing at the expiration of any existing period of obligated active service.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary may accept an active service agreement under this section not more than one year in advance of the end of an officer's existing period of obligated active service under such an agreement.
