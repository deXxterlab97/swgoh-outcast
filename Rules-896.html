<br>§1584. Falsity or lack of manifest; penalties
<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>(1) Any master of any vessel and any person in charge of any vehicle bound to the United States who does not produce the manifest to the officer (whether of the Customs Service or the Coast Guard) demanding the same shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000, and if any merchandise, including sea stores, is found on board of or after having been unladen from such vessel or vehicle which is not included or described in said manifest or does not agree therewith, the master of such vessel or the person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be liable to a penalty equal to the lesser of $10,000 or the domestic value of the merchandise so found or unladen, and any such merchandise belonging or consigned to the master or other officer or to any of the crew of such vessel, or to the owner or person in charge of such vehicle, shall be subject to forfeiture, and if any merchandise described in such manifest is not found on board the vessel or vehicle the master or other person in charge or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be subject to a penalty of $1,000: Provided, That if the Customs Service shall be satisfied that the manifest was lost or mislaid without intentional fraud, or was defaced by accident, or is incorrect by reason of clerical error or other mistake and that no part of the merchandise not found on board was unshipped or discharged except as specified in the report of the master, said penalties shall not be incurred. For purposes of this subsection, the term "clerical error" means a nonnegligent, inadvertent, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest.
<br>
<br>(2) If any of such merchandise so found consists of heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $500 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of crude opium, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for crude opium being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $200 for each ounce thereof so found. Such penalties shall, notwithstanding the proviso in section 1594 of this title (relating to the immunity of vessels or vehicles used as common carriers), constitute a lien upon such vessel which may be enforced by a libel in rem; except that the master or owner of a vessel used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as such common carrier shall not be liable to such penalties and the vessel shall not be held subject to the lien, if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that neither the master nor any of the officers (including licensed and unlicensed officers and petty officers) nor the owner of the vessel knew, and could not, by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence, have known, that such narcotic drugs were on board. Clearance of any such vessel may be withheld until such penalties are paid or until a bond, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is given for the payment thereof. The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the forfeiture of any such vessel or vehicle under any other provision of law. As used in this paragraph, the terms "opiate" and "marihuana" shall have the same meaning given those terms by sections 802(18) and 802(16), respectively, of title 21.
<br>
<br>(3) If any of such merchandise (sea stores excepted), the importation of which into the United States is prohibited, be so found upon any vessel not exceeding five hundred net tons, the vessel shall, in addition to any other penalties herein or by law provided, be seized and forfeited.
<br>(b) Procedures
<br>
<br>(1) If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a)(1) and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue or electronically transmit to the person concerned a notice of intent to issue or electronically transmit a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall—
<br>
<br>(A) describe the merchandise;
<br>
<br>(B) set forth the details of the error in the manifest;
<br>
<br>(C) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;
<br>
<br>(D) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;
<br>
<br>(E) state the estimated loss of lawful duties, if any, and, taking into account all of the circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and
<br>
<br>(F) inform such person that he will have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why such penalty claim should not be issued.
<br>
<br>No notice is required under this subsection for any violation of subsection (a)(1) for which the proposed penalty is $1,000 or less.
<br>
<br>(2) After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a)(1), as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue or electronically transmit a statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, the Customs Service shall issue or electronically transmit a penalty claim to such person. The penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).

<br>(a) Prohibition
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Without regard to whether the United States is or may be deprived of all or a portion of any lawful duty, tax, or fee thereby, no person, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence—
<br>
<br>(A) may enter, introduce, or attempt to enter or introduce any merchandise into the commerce of the United States by means of—
<br>
<br>(i) any document or electronically transmitted data or information, written or oral statement, or act which is material and false, or
<br>
<br>(ii) any omission which is material, or
<br>
<br>(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.
<br>(b) Procedures
<br>(1) Pre-penalty notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) and determines that further proceedings are warranted, it shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of its intention to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall—
<br>
<br>(i) describe the merchandise;
<br>
<br>(ii) set forth the details of the entry or introduction, the attempted entry or introduction, or the aiding or procuring of the entry or introduction;
<br>
<br>(iii) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;
<br>
<br>(iv) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;
<br>
<br>(v) state whether the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud, gross negligence, or negligence;
<br>
<br>(vi) state the estimated loss of lawful duties, taxes, and fees, if any, and, taking into account all circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and
<br>
<br>(vii) inform such person that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.
<br>(B) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The preceding subparagraph shall not apply if—
<br>
<br>(i) the importation with respect to which the violation of subsection (a) occurs is noncommercial in nature, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less.
<br>(2) Penalty claim
<br>
<br>After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a), as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, it shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, it shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vi) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under such section 1618, the Customs Service shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.
<br>(c) Maximum penalties
<br>(1) Fraud
<br>
<br>A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
<br>(2) Gross negligence
<br>
<br>A grossly negligent violation of subsection (a) is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) the domestic value of the merchandise, or
<br>
<br>(ii) four times the lawful duties, taxes, and fees of which the United States is or may be deprived, or
<br>
<br>(B) if the violation did not affect the assessment of duties, 40 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise.
<br>(3) Negligence
<br>
<br>A negligent violation of subsection (a) is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) the lesser of—
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) two times the lawful duties, taxes, and fees of which the United States is or may be deprived, or
<br>
<br>(B) if the violation did not affect the assessment of duties, 20 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise.
<br>(4) Prior disclosure
<br>
<br>If the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation of such violation, with respect to such violation, merchandise shall not be seized and any monetary penalty to be assessed under subsection (c) shall not exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) if the violation resulted from fraud—
<br>
<br>(i) an amount equal to 100 percent of the lawful duties, taxes, and fees of which the United States is or may be deprived, so long as such person tenders the unpaid amount of the lawful duties, taxes, and fees at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide) after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of such unpaid amount, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if such violation did not affect the assessment of duties, 10 percent of the dutiable value; or
<br>
<br>(B) if such violation resulted from negligence or gross negligence, the interest (computed from the date of liquidation at the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26) on the amount of lawful duties, taxes, and fees of which the United States is or may be deprived so long as such person tenders the unpaid amount of the lawful duties, taxes, and fees at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide) after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of such unpaid amount.
<br>
<br>The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge. For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) existed.

<br>§1593a. Penalties for false drawback claims
<br>(a) Prohibition
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>No person, by fraud, or negligence—
<br>
<br>(A) may seek, induce or affect, or attempt to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of—
<br>
<br>(i) any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or
<br>
<br>(ii) any omission which is material; or
<br>
<br>(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.
<br>(b) Procedures
<br>(1) Prepenalty notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall—
<br>
<br>(i) identify the drawback claim;
<br>
<br>(ii) set forth the details relating to the seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the attempted seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the aiding or procuring of, the drawback claim;
<br>
<br>(iii) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;
<br>
<br>(iv) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;
<br>
<br>(v) state whether the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud or negligence;
<br>
<br>(vi) state the estimated actual or potential loss of revenue due to the drawback claim, and, taking into account all circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and
<br>
<br>(vii) inform such person that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.
<br>(B) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The Customs Service may not issue a prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty claim.
<br>(C) Prior approval
<br>
<br>No prepenalty notice in which the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.
<br>(2) Penalty claim
<br>
<br>After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a), as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the Customs Service shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.
<br>(c) Maximum penalties
<br>(1) Fraud
<br>
<br>A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.
<br>(2) Negligence
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A negligent violation of subsection (a) is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the 1st violation.
<br>(B) Repetitive violations
<br>
<br>If the Customs Service determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.
<br>(3) Prior disclosure
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (B), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed—
<br>
<br>(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that—
<br>
<br>(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the claim; and
<br>
<br>(II) ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.
<br>(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations
<br>
<br>The limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed under this subsection apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the overpayment.
<br>(C) Burden of proof
<br>
<br>The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.
<br>(4) Commencement of investigation
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) existed.
<br>(5) Exclusivity
<br>
<br>Penalty claims under this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of subsection (a).
<br>(d) Deprivation of lawful revenue
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes resulting from a violation of subsection (a), the Customs Service shall require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.
<br>(e) Drawback compliance program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After consultation with the drawback trade community, the Customs Service shall establish a drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest may participate after being certified by the Customs Service under paragraph (2). Participation in the drawback compliance program is voluntary.
<br>(2) Certification
<br>
<br>A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the general requirements established under the program or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the party and the Customs Service. Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program and the volume of claims. In order to be certified, the participant must be able to demonstrate that it—
<br>
<br>(A) understands the legal requirements for filing claims, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods involved;
