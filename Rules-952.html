<br>(B) Special rule for certain components
<br>
<br>The following components of the value of nonoriginating materials used by the producer in the production of a good may be counted as originating content for purposes of determining whether the good meets the regional value content requirement set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA:

<br>(B) Review of adjustment
<br>
<br>Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to prevent any review or appeal available in accordance with article 5.15 of the USMCA with respect to an adjustment to or a rejection of—

<br>(7) Calculating net cost
<br>
<br>The producer of a good may, consistent with regulations implementing this section, calculate the net cost of the good under paragraph (3) by—
<br>
<br>(A) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales services costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of those goods, and then reasonably allocating the resulting net cost of those goods to the good;
<br>
<br>(B) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating the total cost to the good, and subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs, that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the good; or
<br>
<br>(C) reasonably allocating each cost that is part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs.
<br>(8) Value of materials used in production
<br>
<br>For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good under this subsection, applying the de minimis rules under subsection (f), and calculating the value of nonoriginating components in a set under subsection (m), the value of a material used in the production of a good is—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a material that is imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the material;
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a material acquired in the territory in which the good is produced—
<br>
<br>(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the USMCA country where the producer is located;
<br>
<br>(ii) the value as determined under subparagraph (A), as set forth in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury providing for the application of transaction value in the absence of an importation by the producer; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the country; or
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a self-produced material, the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) all expenses incurred in the production of the material, including general expenses; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount for profit equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the material.
<br>(9) Intermediate materials
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any self-produced material that is used in the production of a good may be designated by the producer of the good as an intermediate material for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph (2) or (3).
<br>(B) Materials used in production of intermediate materials
<br>
<br>If a self-produced material is designated as an intermediate material under subparagraph (A) for purposes of calculating a regional value content requirement, no other self-produced material subject to a regional value content requirement used or consumed in the production of that intermediate material may be designated by the producer as an intermediate material.
<br>(10) Further adjustments to value of materials
<br>
<br>The following expenses, if included in the value of a nonoriginating material calculated under paragraph (8), may be deducted from the value of the nonoriginating material:
<br>
<br>(A) The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer.
<br>
<br>(B) Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more USMCA countries, other than duties or taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable.
<br>
<br>(C) The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or byproducts.
<br>(e) Accumulation
<br>(1) Producers
<br>
<br>A good that is produced in the territory of one or more USMCA countries, by one or more producers, is an originating good if the good satisfies the requirements of subsection (c) and all other applicable requirements of this section.
<br>(2) Originating materials used in production of goods of a USMCA country
<br>
<br>Originating materials from the territory of one or more USMCA countries that are used in the production of a good in the territory of another USMCA country shall be considered to originate in the territory of such other USMCA country.
<br>(3) Production undertaken on nonoriginating materials used in the production of goods
<br>
<br>In determining whether a good is an originating good under this section, production undertaken on nonoriginating material in the territory of one or more USMCA countries by one or more producers shall contribute to the originating status of the good, regardless of whether that production is sufficient to confer originating status to the nonoriginating material.
<br>(f) De minimis amounts of nonoriginating materials
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) through (4), a good that does not undergo a change in tariff classification or satisfy a regional value content requirement set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA is an originating good if—
<br>
<br>(A) the value of all nonoriginating materials that are used in the production of the good, and do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA—
<br>
<br>(i) does not exceed 10 percent of the transaction value of the good, adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good; or
<br>
<br>(ii) does not exceed 10 percent of the total cost of the good;

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the rules set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA, goods classifiable as goods put up in sets for retail sale as provided for in rule 3 of the General Rule of Interpretation of the HTS shall not be considered to be originating goods unless—
