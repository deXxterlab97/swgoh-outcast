<br>Part B—Assistance for Women, Children, and Families
<br>§7651. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over 90 percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities.
<br>
<br>(2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions.
<br>
<br>(3) Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.
<br>
<br>(4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.
<br>
<br>(5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are already supporting programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations.
<br>
<br>(6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can provide the basis for a broader response that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.
<br>
<br>(7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by the year 2010.
<br>
<br>(8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new infections are occurring among this age group.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–25, title III, §311, May 27, 2003, 117 Stat. 740.)
<br>§7652. Policy and requirements
<br>(a) Policy
<br>
<br>The United States Government's response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic should place high priority on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the care and treatment of family members and caregivers, and the care of children orphaned by AIDS. To the maximum extent possible, the United States Government should seek to leverage its funds by seeking matching contributions from the private sector, other national governments, and international organizations.
<br>(b) Requirements
<br>
<br>The 5-year United States Government strategy required by section 7611 of this title shall—
<br>
<br>(1) establish a target for the prevention and treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV that, by 2013, will reach at least 80 percent of pregnant women in those countries most affected by HIV/AIDS in which the United States has HIV/AIDS programs;
<br>
<br>(2) establish a target that, by 2013, the proportion of children receiving care and treatment under this chapter is proportionate to their numbers within the population of HIV infected individuals in each country;
<br>
<br>(3) integrate care and treatment with prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs to improve outcomes for HIV-affected women and families as soon as is feasible and support strategies that promote successful follow-up and continuity of care of mother and child;
<br>
<br>(4) expand programs designed to care for children orphaned by, affected by, or vulnerable to HIV/AIDS;
<br>
<br>(5) ensure that women in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs are provided with, or referred to, appropriate maternal and child services; and
<br>
<br>(6) develop a timeline for expanding access to more effective regimes to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, consistent with the national policies of countries in which programs are administered under this chapter and the goal of achieving universal use of such regimes as soon as possible.
<br>(c) Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Expert Panel

<br>
<br>(2) by the end of fiscal year 2005, at least 1,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment; and
<br>
<br>(3) by the end of fiscal year 2006, at least 2,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment.
<br>(b) Effective distribution of HIV/AIDS funds
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that, of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance, 10 percent should be used for orphans and vulnerable children.

<br>(a) Balanced funding requirement
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Global AIDS Coordinator shall—
<br>
<br>(A) provide balanced funding for prevention activities for sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS; and
<br>
<br>(B) ensure that activities promoting abstinence, delay of sexual debut, monogamy, fidelity, and partner reduction are implemented and funded in a meaningful and equitable way in the strategy for each host country based on objective epidemiological evidence as to the source of infections and in consultation with the government of each host county 1 involved in HIV/AIDS prevention activities.
<br>(2) Prevention strategy
<br>(A) Establishment
<br>
<br>In carrying out paragraph (1), the Global AIDS Coordinator shall establish an HIV sexual transmission prevention strategy governing the expenditure of funds authorized under this chapter to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV in any host country with a generalized epidemic.

<br>In each host country described in subparagraph (A), if the strategy established under subparagraph (A) provides less than 50 percent of the funds described in subparagraph (A) for activities promoting abstinence, delay of sexual debut, monogamy, fidelity, and partner reduction, the Global AIDS Coordinator shall, not later than 30 days after the issuance of this strategy, report to the appropriate congressional committees on the justification for this decision.
<br>(3) Exclusion
<br>
<br>Programs and activities that implement or purchase new prevention technologies or modalities, such as medical male circumcision, public education about risks to acquire HIV infection from blood exposures, promoting universal precautions, investigating suspected nosocomial infections, pre-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis to prevent transmission of HIV, or microbicides and programs and activities that provide counseling and testing for HIV or prevent mother-to-child prevention of HIV, shall not be included in determining compliance with paragraph (2).
<br>(4) Report
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after July 30, 2008, and annually thereafter as part of the annual report required under section 2151b–2(e) of this title, the President shall—

<br>(c) Treatment of countries with per capita income changes
<br>
<br>A country qualifying for candidate status under this section with a per capita income that changes during the fiscal year such that the country would be reclassified from a low income country to a lower middle income country or from a lower middle income country to a low income country shall retain its candidacy status in its former income classification for such fiscal year and the 2 subsequent fiscal years.

<br>(3) laws relating to the legal status of civil society organizations, including laws which effectively discriminate against foreign civil society organizations as compared to similarly situated domestic organizations;
<br>
<br>(4) laws regulating the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly; and
<br>
<br>(5) laws regulating the usage of the Internet, particularly by foreign civil society organizations.
<br>(e) Establishment of criteria and methodology
<br>
