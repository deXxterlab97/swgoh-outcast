<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–181, div. C, title XXXV, §3517, Jan. 28, 2008, 122 Stat. 595, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The maritime loan guarantee program was established by the Congress through the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [see Short Title of 1936 Amendment note set out under section 101 of this title] to encourage domestic shipbuilding by making available federally backed loan guarantees for new construction to ship owners and operators.
<br>
<br>"(2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and successful history of ship construction with a low historical default rate.
<br>
<br>"(3) The current process for review of applications for maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the Congress.
<br>
<br>"(4) The President has requested no funding for the loan guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.
<br>
<br>"(6) The maritime loan guarantee program has the potential to modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise trade and restore a competitive position in the world shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.
<br>
<br>"(7) The maritime loan guarantee program is a useful tool to encourage domestic shipbuilding, preserving a vital industrial capacity critical to the security of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(b) Requirements.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008], the Administrator of the Maritime Administration shall develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the review of applications for loan guarantees under chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(2) Deadline for action on application.—
<br>
<br>"(A) Traditional applications.—In the comprehensive plan the Administrator will ensure that within the 90-day period following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for review of a traditional loan application, the application shall be either accepted or rejected.
<br>
<br>"(B) Nontraditional applications.—In the comprehensive plan the Administrator will ensure that within the 180-day period following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for review of a nontraditional loan application, the application shall be either accepted or rejected.
<br>
<br>"(c) Submission to Congress.—The Administrator shall submit a copy of the comprehensive plan to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008].
<br>
<br>"(d) Definitions.—In this section:
<br>
<br>"(1) Traditional application.—The term 'traditional application' means an application for a loan, guarantee, or commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code, that involves a market, technology, and financial structure of a type that has proven successful in previous applications and does not present an unreasonable risk to the United States, as determined by the Administrator of the Maritime Administration.
<br>
<br>"(2) Nontraditional application.—The term 'nontraditional application' means an application for a loan, guarantee, or commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code, that is not a traditional application, as determined by the Administrator of the Maritime Administration."
<br>§53704. Funding limits
<br>
<br>(a) General Limitations.—The total unpaid principal amount of obligations guaranteed under this chapter and outstanding at one time may not exceed $12,000,000,000. Of that amount, $850,000,000 shall be limited to obligations related to fishing vessels and fishery facilities.
<br>
<br>(b) Additional Limitations.—Additional limitations may not be imposed on new commitments to guarantee loans for any fiscal year, except in amounts established in advance by annual authorization laws. A vessel eligible for a guarantee under this chapter may not be denied eligibility because of its type.
<br>
<br>(c) Limits Based on Risk Factors.—
<br>
<br>(1) Definition.—In this subsection, the term "cost" has the meaning given that term in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a).
<br>
<br>(2) System of risk categories.—The Secretary or Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish, and update annually, a system of risk categories for obligations guaranteed under this chapter that categorizes the relative risk of guarantees based on the risk factors set forth in paragraph (4);
<br>
<br>(B) determine annually for each risk category a subsidy rate equivalent to the cost of obligations in the category, expressed as a percentage of the amount guaranteed for obligations in the category; and
<br>
<br>(C) ensure that each risk category is comprised of loans that are relatively homogeneous in cost and share characteristics predictive of defaults and other costs, given the facts known at the time of obligation or commitment, using a risk category system that is based on historical analysis of program data and statistical evidence concerning the likely costs of defaults or other costs that are expected to be associated with the loans in the category.
<br>
<br>(3) Use of system.—
<br>
<br>(A) Placing obligation in category.—Before making a guarantee under this chapter for an obligation, and annually for projects subject to a guarantee, the Secretary or Administrator shall apply the risk factors specified in paragraph (4) to place the obligation in a risk category established under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) Reduction of available amount.—The Secretary or Administrator shall consider the total amount available to the Secretary or Administrator for making guarantees under this chapter to be reduced by the amount determined by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount guaranteed under this chapter for an obligation; by
<br>
<br>(ii) the subsidy rate for the category in which the obligation is placed under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) Estimated cost.—The estimated cost to the United States Government of a guarantee under this chapter for an obligation is deemed to be the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the obligation.
<br>
<br>(D) Restriction on further guarantees.—The Secretary or Administrator may not guarantee obligations under this chapter after the total amount available to the Secretary or Administrator under appropriations laws for the cost of loan guarantees is considered to be reduced to zero under subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(4) Risk factors.—The risk factors referred to in this subsection are—
<br>
<br>(A) the period for which an obligation is guaranteed or to be guaranteed;
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of an obligation guaranteed or to be guaranteed in relation to the total cost of the project financed or to be financed by the obligation;
<br>
<br>(C) the financial condition of an obligor or applicant for a guarantee;
<br>
<br>(D) if applicable, other guarantees related to the project;
<br>
<br>(E) if applicable, the projected employment of each vessel or equipment to be financed with an obligation;
<br>
<br>(F) if applicable, the projected market that will be served by each vessel or equipment to be financed with an obligation;
<br>
<br>(G) the collateral provided for a guarantee for an obligation;
<br>
<br>(H) the management and operating experience of an obligor or applicant for a guarantee;
<br>
<br>(I) whether a guarantee under this chapter is or will be in effect during the construction period of the project; and
<br>
<br>(J) the concentration risk presented by an unduly large percentage of loans outstanding by any one borrower or group of affiliated borrowers.

<br>§53706. Eligible purposes of obligations
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—To be eligible for a guarantee under this chapter, an obligation must aid in any of the following:
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Financing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel designed principally for research, or for commercial use—
<br>
<br>(i) in the coastwise or intercoastal trade;
<br>
<br>(ii) on the Great Lakes, or on bays, sounds, rivers, harbors, or inland lakes of the United States;
<br>
<br>(iii) in foreign trade as defined in section 109(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(iv) as an ocean thermal energy conversion facility or plantship; or
<br>
<br>(v) as a floating drydock in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or repair of vessels.
<br>
<br>(B) A guarantee under subparagraph (A) may not be made more than one year after delivery of the vessel (or redelivery if the vessel was reconstructed or reconditioned) unless the proceeds of the obligation are used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or of facilities or equipment related to marine operations.
<br>
<br>(2) Financing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or purchase of a vessel owned by citizens of the United States and designed principally for research, or for commercial use in the fishing industry.
<br>
<br>(3) Financing the purchase, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or fishery facility—
<br>
<br>(A) for which an obligation was guaranteed under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) that, under subchapter II of this chapter—
<br>
<br>(i) is a vessel or fishery facility for which an obligation was accelerated and paid;
<br>
<br>(ii) was acquired by the Federal Ship Financing Fund or successor account under section 53717 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(iii) was sold at foreclosure begun or intervened in by the Secretary or Administrator.
<br>
<br>(4) Financing any part of the repayment to the United States Government of any amount of a construction-differential subsidy paid for a vessel.
<br>
<br>(5) Refinancing an existing obligation (regardless of whether guaranteed under this chapter) issued for a purpose described in paragraphs (1)–(4), including a short-term obligation incurred to obtain temporary funds with the intention of refinancing.
<br>
<br>(6) Financing or refinancing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or purchase of a fishery facility.
<br>
<br>(7) Financing or refinancing—
<br>
<br>(A) the purchase of individual fishing quotas in accordance with section 303(d)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (including the reimbursement of obligors for expenditures previously made for such a purchase);
<br>
<br>(B) activities that assist in the transition to reduced fishing capacity; or
<br>
<br>(C) technologies or upgrades designed to improve collection and reporting of fishery-dependent data, to reduce bycatch, to improve selectivity or reduce adverse impacts of fishing gear, or to improve safety.
<br>
<br>(b) Non-Vessels Treated as Vessels.—An obligation guaranteed under subsection (a)(6) or (7) shall be treated, for purposes of this chapter, in the same manner and to the same extent as an obligation that aids in financing the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or purchase of a vessel, except with respect to provisions that by their nature can only be applied to vessels.
<br>
<br>(c) Priorities for Certain Vessels.—
<br>
<br>(1) Vessels.—In guaranteeing or making a commitment to guarantee an obligation under this chapter, the Administrator shall give priority to—
<br>
<br>(A) a vessel that is otherwise eligible for a guarantee and is constructed with assistance under subtitle D of the Maritime Security Act of 2003 (46 U.S.C. 53101 note);
<br>
<br>(B) after applying subparagraph (A), a vessel that is otherwise eligible for a guarantee and that the Secretary of Defense determines—
<br>
<br>(i) is suitable for service as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency; and
<br>
<br>(ii) meets a shortfall in sealift capacity or capability; and
<br>
<br>(C) after applying subparagraphs (A) and (B), Vessels of National Interest.
<br>
<br>(2) Time for determination.—The Secretary of Defense shall determine whether a vessel satisfies paragraph (1)(B) not later than 30 days after receipt of a request from the Administrator for such a determination.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "To be eligible for a guarantee under this chapter, an obligation must aid in any of the following" are substituted for "Pursuant to the authority granted under section 1273(a) of this Appendix, the Secretary, upon such terms as he shall prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee, payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation which aids in" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(2), the words "citizens of the United States" are substituted for "citizens or nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands" because of the definition of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a "citizen of the United States" as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective November 4, 1986.

<br>(b) Operators of Liner Vessels.—The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee a loan for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a liner vessel under this chapter unless the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission certifies that the operator of the vessel has not been found by the Commission to have committed, within the previous 5 years—
<br>
<br>(1) a violation of part A of subtitle IV of this title that involves unjust or unfair discriminatory treatment or undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to a United States shipper, ocean transportation intermediary, ocean common carrier, or port; or
<br>
<br>(2) a violation of part B of subtitle IV of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Operators of Fishing Vessels.—The Secretary may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee a loan for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a fishing vessel under this chapter if the operator of the vessel has been—
<br>
<br>(1) held liable, or the vessel has been held liable in rem, for a civil penalty under section 308 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1858) and the operator has not paid the penalty;

<br>
<br>(1) the need in the particular segment of the maritime industry for new or additional capacity, including any impact on existing equipment for which a guarantee under this chapter is in effect;

<br>(A) the size and speed of the vessel are approved by the Secretary or Administrator;
<br>
<br>(B) the vessel is or would have been eligible for mortgage aid for construction under section 509 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or would have been eligible except that the vessel was built with a construction-differential subsidy and the subsidy has been repaid; and

<br>During review of this bill, the American Bureau of Shipping, through counsel, explained that it disagrees with an existing interpretation by the Maritime Administration of language restated in subsection (a)(4)(A) of this section, and requested the Committee to clarify that this codification should not be construed as a ratification of that regulatory interpretation. The Committee therefore states that this codification should not be construed as an expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning any such administrative interpretation.

<br>In subsection (b)(1), the reference to section 503 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is substituted for the reference to "subchapter V of this chapter" because the relevant characteristics referred to in the text are contained in that section and because that section is part of the construction-differential subsidy program, which is not being restated.

<br>§53714. Guarantee fees
<br>
<br>(a) Regulations.—Subject to this section, the Secretary or Administrator shall prescribe regulations to assess a fee for guaranteeing an obligation under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Computation of Fee.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The amount of the fee for a guarantee under this chapter shall be equal to the sum of the amounts determined under paragraph (2) for the years in which the guarantee is in effect.
<br>
<br>(2) Present value for each year.—The amount referred to in paragraph (1) for a year in which the guarantee is in effect is the present value of the amount calculated under paragraph (3). To determine the present value, the Secretary or Administrator shall apply a discount rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, considering current market yields on outstanding obligations of the United States Government having periods to maturity comparable to the period to maturity for the guaranteed obligation.
<br>
<br>(3) Calculation of amount.—The amount referred to in paragraph (2) shall be calculated by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(A) the estimated average unpaid principal amount of the obligation that will be outstanding during the year (excluding the average amount, other than interest, on deposit during the year in an escrow fund under section 53715 of this title); by
<br>
<br>(B) the fee rate set under paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(4) Setting fee rates.—To set the fee rate referred to in paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary or Administrator shall establish a formula that—
<br>
<br>(A) takes into account the security provided for the guaranteed obligation; and
<br>
<br>(B) is a sliding scale based on the creditworthiness of the obligor, using—
<br>
<br>(i) the lowest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the most creditworthy obligors; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the highest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the least creditworthy obligors.
<br>
<br>(5) Permissible range of rates.—The fee rate set under paragraph (4) shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) for a delivered vessel or equipment, at least 0.5 percent and not more than 1 percent; and
<br>
<br>(B) for a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned or equipment to be delivered, at least 0.25 percent and not more than 0.5 percent.
<br>
<br>(c) When Fee Collected.—A fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this chapter shall be collected not later than the date on which an amount is first paid on the obligation.
<br>
<br>(d) Financing the Fee.—A fee paid under this section is eligible to be financed under this chapter and shall be included in the actual cost of the obligation guaranteed.
<br>
<br>(e) Not Refundable.—A fee paid under this section is not refundable. However, an obligor shall receive credit for the amount paid for the remaining term of the obligation if the obligation is refinanced and guaranteed under this chapter after the refinancing.

<br>§53715. Escrow fund
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—If the proceeds of an obligation guaranteed under this chapter are to be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel that will serve as security for a guarantee under this chapter, the Secretary or Administrator may accept and hold in escrow, under an escrow agreement with the obligor, a portion of the proceeds of all obligations guaranteed under this chapter whose proceeds are to be so used which is equal to—
<br>
<br>(1) the excess of—
<br>
<br>(A) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds are to be so used; over
<br>
<br>(B) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the amount paid by or for the account of the obligor for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel; plus
<br>
<br>(2) any interest the Secretary or Administrator may require on the amount described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(b) Security Involving Both Uncompleted and Delivered Vessels.—If the security for the guarantee of an obligation relates both to a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned and to a delivered vessel, the principal amount of the obligation shall be prorated for purposes of subsection (a) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator.
<br>
<br>(c) Disbursement Before Termination of Agreement.—
<br>
<br>(1) Purposes.—The Secretary or Administrator shall disburse amounts in the escrow fund, as specified in the escrow agreement, to—
<br>
<br>(A) pay amounts the obligor is obligated to pay for—
<br>
<br>(i) the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel used as security for the guarantee; and
<br>
<br>(ii) interest on the obligations;
<br>
<br>(B) redeem the obligations under a refinancing guaranteed under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(C) pay any excess interest deposits to the obligor at times provided for in the escrow agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) Manner of payment.—If a payment becomes due under the guarantee before the termination of the escrow agreement, the amount in the escrow fund at the time the payment becomes due, including realized income not yet paid to the obligor, shall be paid into the appropriate account under section 53717 of this title. The amount shall be credited against amounts due or to become due from the obligor to the Secretary or Administrator on the guaranteed obligations or, to the extent not so required, be paid to the obligor.
<br>
<br>(d) Payments Required Before Disbursement.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—No disbursement shall be made under subsection (c) to any person until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the aggregate actual cost of the vessel, as previously approved by the Secretary or Administrator. If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.
<br>
<br>(2) Documented proof of progress requirement.—The Secretary or Administrator shall, by regulation, establish a transparent, independent, and risk-based process for verifying and documenting the progress of projects under construction before disbursing guaranteed loan funds. At a minimum, the process shall require documented proof of progress in connection with the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels before disbursements are made from the escrow fund. The Secretary or Administrator may require that the obligor provide a certificate from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken place.
<br>
<br>(e) Disbursement on Termination of Agreement.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—If a payment has not become due under the guarantee before the termination of the escrow agreement, the balance of the escrow fund at the time of termination shall be disbursed to—
<br>
<br>(A) prepay the excess of—
<br>
<br>(i) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds are to be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel used or to be used as security for the guarantee; over
<br>
<br>(ii) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the actual cost of the vessel to the extent paid; and
<br>
<br>(B) pay interest on that prepaid amount of principal.
<br>
<br>(2) Remaining balance.—Any remaining balance of the escrow fund shall be paid to the obligor.
<br>
<br>(f) Investment.—The Secretary or Administrator may invest and reinvest any part of an escrow fund in obligations of the United States Government with maturities such that the escrow fund will be available as required for purposes of the escrow agreement. Investment income shall be paid to the obligor when received.
<br>
<br>(g) Terms To Protect Government.—The escrow agreement shall contain other terms the Secretary or Administrator considers necessary to protect fully the interests of the Government.
