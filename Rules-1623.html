<br>
<br>(a) It is declared to be the purposes of the Congress in this chapter to—
<br>
<br>(1) authorize and regulate the location, ownership, construction, and operation of deepwater ports in waters beyond the territorial limits of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) provide for the protection of the marine and coastal environment to prevent or minimize any adverse impact which might occur as a consequence of the development of such ports;
<br>
<br>(3) protect the interests of the United States and those of adjacent coastal States in the location, construction, and operation of deepwater ports;
<br>
<br>(4) protect the rights and responsibilities of States and communities to regulate growth, determine land use, and otherwise protect the environment in accordance with law;
<br>
<br>(5) promote the construction and operation of deepwater ports as a safe and effective means of importing oil or natural gas into the United States and transporting oil or natural gas from the outer continental shelf 1 while minimizing tanker traffic and the risks attendant thereto; and
<br>
<br>(6) promote oil or natural gas production on the outer continental shelf 1 by affording an economic and safe means of transportation of outer continental shelf 1 oil or natural gas to the United States mainland.
<br>
<br>(b) The Congress declares that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the legal status of the high seas, the superjacent airspace, or the seabed and subsoil, including the Continental Shelf.

<br>
<br>(1) on application, issue a license for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port; and
<br>
<br>(2) on petition of the licensee, amend, transfer, or reinstate a license issued under this chapter.
<br>(c) Conditions for issuance
<br>
<br>The Secretary may issue a license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter if—

<br>(d) Application for license subject to examination and comparison of economic, social, and environmental effects of deepwater port facility and deep draft channel and harbor; finality of determination
<br>
<br>If an application is made under this chapter for a license to construct a deepwater port facility off the coast of a State, and a port of the State which will be directly connected by pipeline with such deepwater port, on the date of such application—
<br>
<br>(1) has existing plans for construction of a deep draft channel and harbor; and
<br>
<br>(2) has either (A) an active study by the Secretary of the Army relating to the construction of a deep draft channel and harbor, or (B) a pending application for a permit under section 403 of this title for such construction; and
<br>
<br>(3) applies to the Secretary for a determination under this section within 30 days of the date of the license application;
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall not issue a license under this chapter until he has examined and compared the economic, social, and environmental effects of the construction and operation of the deepwater port with the economic, social and environmental effects of the construction, expansion, deepening, and operation of such State port, and has determined which project best serves the national interest or that both developments are warranted. The Secretary's determination shall be discretionary and nonreviewable.
<br>(e) Additional conditions; removal requirements, waiver; Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act applicable to utilization of components upon waiver of removal requirements
<br>

On petition of a licensee, the Secretary shall review any condition of a license issued under this chapter to determine if that condition is uniform, insofar as practicable, with the conditions of other licenses issued under this chapter, reasonable, and necessary to meet the objectives of this chapter. The Secretary shall amend or rescind any condition that is no longer necessary or otherwise required by any Federal department or agency under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) No license shall be issued, transferred, or renewed under this chapter unless the licensee or transferee first agrees in writing that (A) there will be no substantial change from the plans, operational systems, and methods, procedures, and safeguards set forth in his license, as approved, without prior approval in writing from the Secretary; and (B) he will comply with any condition the Secretary may prescribe in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall establish such bonding requirements or other assurances as he deems necessary to assure that, upon the revocation or termination of a license, the licensee will remove all components of the deepwater port. In the case of components lying in the subsoil below the seabed, the Secretary is authorized to waive the removal requirements if he finds that such removal is not otherwise necessary and that the remaining components do not constitute any threat to navigation or to the environment. At the request of the licensee, the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, is authorized to waive the removal requirement as to any components which he determines may be utilized in connection with the transportation of oil, natural gas, or other minerals, pursuant to a lease granted under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.], after which waiver the utilization of such components shall be governed by the terms of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.
<br>(f) Amendments, transfers, and reinstatements
<br>
<br>The Secretary may amend, transfer, or reinstate a license issued under this chapter 2 if the Secretary finds that the amendment, transfer, or reinstatement is consistent with the requirements of this chapter.
<br>(g) Eligible citizens

<br>(d) Application area; publication in Federal Register; "application area" defined; submission of other applications; notice of intent and submission of completed applications; denial of pending application prior to consideration of other untimely applications
<br>
<br>(1) At the time notice of an application is published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall publish a description in the Federal Register of an application area encompassing the deepwater port site proposed by such application and within which construction of the proposed deepwater port would eliminate, at the time such application was submitted, the need for any other deepwater port within that application area.
<br>
<br>(2) As used in this section, "application area" means any reasonable geographical area within which a deepwater port may be constructed and operated. Such application area shall not exceed a circular zone, the center of which is the principal point of loading and unloading at the port, and the radius of which is the distance from such point to the high water mark of the nearest adjacent coastal State.

<br>
<br>(2) An application filed with the Secretary shall constitute an application for all Federal authorizations required for ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port. At the time notice of any application is published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall forward a copy of such application to those Federal agencies and departments with jurisdiction over any aspect of such ownership, construction, or operation for comment, review, or recommendation as to conditions and for such other action as may be required by law. Each agency or department involved shall review the application and, based upon legal considerations within its area of responsibility, recommend to the Secretary, the approval or disapproval of the application not later than 45 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license for a designated application area. In any case in which the agency or department recommends disapproval, it shall set forth in detail the manner in which the application does not comply with any law or regulation within its area of responsibility and shall notify the Secretary how the application may be amended so as to bring it into compliance with the law or regulation involved.
<br>(f) NEPA compliance
<br>
<br>For all applications, the Secretary, in cooperation with other involved Federal agencies and departments, shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.].

<br>(g) Public notice and hearings; evidentiary hearing in District of Columbia; decision of Secretary based on evidentiary record; consolidation of hearings
<br>
<br>A license may be issued only after public notice and public hearings in accordance with this subsection. At least one such public hearing shall be held in each adjacent coastal State. Any interested person may present relevant material at any hearing. After hearings in each adjacent coastal State are concluded if the Secretary determines that there exists one or more specific and material factual issues which may be resolved by a formal evidentiary hearing, at least one adjudicatory hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 554 of title 5 in the District of Columbia. The record developed in any such adjudicatory hearing shall be basis for the Secretary's decision to approve or deny a license. Hearings held pursuant to this subsection shall be consolidated insofar as practicable with hearings held by other agencies. All public hearings on all applications for any designated application area shall be consolidated and shall be concluded not later than 240 days after notice of the initial application has been published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
<br>(h) Nonrefundable application fee; processing costs; State fees; "land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility" defined; fair market rental value, advance payment
<br>
<br>(1) Each person applying for a license pursuant to this chapter shall remit to the Secretary at the time the application is filed a nonrefundable application fee established by regulation by the Secretary. In addition, an applicant shall also reimburse the United States and the appropriate adjacent coastal State for any additional costs incurred in processing an application.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and unless prohibited by law, an adjacent coastal State may fix reasonable fees for the use of a deepwater port facility, and such State and any other State in which land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility are located may set reasonable fees for the use of such land-based facilities. Fees may be fixed under authority of this paragraph as compensation for any economic cost attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities, which cannot be recovered under other authority of such State or political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, and for environmental and administrative costs attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities. Fees under this paragraph shall not exceed such economic, environmental, and administrative costs of such State. Such fees shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary. As used in this paragraph, the term "land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility" means the onshore tank farm and pipelines connecting such tank farm to the deepwater port facility.
<br>
<br>(3) A licensee shall pay annually in advance the fair market rental value (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) of the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States to be utilized by the deepwater port, including the fair market rental value of the right-of-way necessary for the pipeline segment of the port located on such subsoil and seabed.
<br>(i) Application approval; period for determination; priorities; criteria for determination of application best serving national interest
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall approve or deny any application for a designated application area submitted pursuant to this chapter not later than 90 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license for that area.
<br>
<br>(2) In the event more than one application is submitted for an application area, the Secretary, unless one of the proposed deepwater ports clearly best serves the national interest, shall issue a license according to the following order of priorities:
<br>
<br>(A) to an adjacent coastal State (or combination of States), any political subdivision thereof, or agency or instrumentality, including a wholly owned corporation of any such government;
<br>
<br>(B) to a person who is neither (i) engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil, nor (ii) an affiliate of any person who is engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil or an affiliate of any such affiliate;
<br>
<br>(C) to any other person.
<br>
<br>(3) In determining whether any one proposed deepwater port clearly best serves the national interest, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:
<br>
<br>(A) the degree to which the proposed deepwater ports affect the environment, as determined under criteria established pursuant to section 1505 of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) any significant differences between anticipated completion dates for the proposed deepwater ports; and
<br>
<br>(C) any differences in costs of construction and operation of the proposed deepwater ports, to the extent that such differential may significantly affect the ultimate cost of oil to the consumer.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall approve or deny any application for a deepwater port for natural gas submitted pursuant to this chapter not later than 90 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license. Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection shall not apply to an application for a deepwater port for natural gas.
<br>(j) LNG tankers
<br>(1) Program
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Transportation shall develop and implement a program to promote the transportation of liquefied natural gas to and from the United States on United States flag vessels.
<br>(2) Information to be provided
<br>
<br>When the Coast Guard is operating as a contributing agency in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's shoreside licensing process for a liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas terminal located on shore or within State seaward boundaries, the Coast Guard shall provide to the Commission the information described in subsection (c)(2)(K) with respect to vessels reasonably anticipated to be servicing that port.

<br>§1507. Common carrier status
<br>(a) Status of deepwater ports and storage facilities
<br>
<br>A deepwater port and a storage facility serviced directly by that deepwater port shall operate as a common carrier under applicable provisions of part I of the Interstate Commerce Act and subtitle IV of title 49, and shall accept, transport, or convey without discrimination all oil delivered to the deepwater port with respect to which its license is issued, except as provided by subsection (b) of this section.
<br>(b) Discrimination prohibition; exceptions
<br>
<br>A licensee is not discriminating under this section and is not subject to common carrier regulations under subsection (a) of this section when that licensee—
<br>
<br>(1) is subject to effective competition for the transportation of oil from alternative transportation systems; and

The licensee may make unused capacity of the deepwater port and storage facilities available to other persons, pursuant to reasonable terms and conditions imposed by the licensee, if such use does not otherwise interfere in any way with the acceptance, transport, storage, regasification, or conveyance of natural gas produced, processed, marketed, or otherwise obtained by agreement by such licensee or its affiliates.
<br>(e) Jurisdiction
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.), any regulation or rule issued thereunder, or section 1518 of this title as it pertains to such Act, this chapter shall apply with respect to the licensing, siting, construction, or operation of a deepwater natural gas port or the acceptance, transport, storage, regasification, or conveyance of natural gas at or through a deepwater port, to the exclusion of the Natural Gas Act or any regulation or rule issued thereunder.

<br>§1508. Adjacent coastal States
<br>(a) Designation; direct pipeline connections; mileage; risk of damage to coastal environment, time for designation
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary, in issuing notice of application pursuant to section 1504(c) of this title, shall designate as an "adjacent coastal State" any coastal State which (A) would be directly connected by pipeline to a deepwater port as proposed in an application, or (B) would be located within 15 miles of any such proposed deepwater port.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall, upon request of a State, and after having received the recommendations of the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, designate such State as an "adjacent coastal State" if he determines that there is a risk of damage to the coastal environment of such State equal to or greater than the risk posed to a State directly connected by pipeline to the proposed deepwater port. This paragraph shall apply only with respect to requests made by a State not later than the 14th day after the date of publication of notice of an application for a proposed deepwater port in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1504(c) of this title. The Secretary shall make the designation required by this paragraph not later than the 45th day after the date he receives such a request from a State.
<br>(b) Applications; submittal to Governors for approval or disapproval; consistency of Federal licenses and State programs; views of other interested States

<br>(1) Not later than 10 days after the designation of adjacent coastal States pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary shall transmit a complete copy of the application to the Governor of each adjacent coastal State. The Secretary shall not issue a license without the approval of the Governor of each adjacent coastal State. If the Governor fails to transmit his approval or disapproval to the Secretary not later than 45 days after the last public hearing on applications for a particular application area, such approval shall be conclusively presumed. If the Governor notifies the Secretary that an application, which would otherwise be approved pursuant to this paragraph, is inconsistent with State programs relating to environmental protection, land and water use, and coastal zone management, the Secretary shall condition the license granted so as to make it consistent with such State programs.
<br>
<br>(2) Any other interested State shall have the opportunity to make its views known to, and shall be given full consideration by, the Secretary regarding the location, construction, and operation of a deepwater port.
<br>(c) Reasonable progress toward development of coastal zone management program; planning grants
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not issue a license unless the adjacent coastal State to which the deepwater port is to be directly connected by pipeline has developed, or is making, at the time the application is submitted, reasonable progress toward developing an approved coastal zone management program pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 [16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.] in the area to be directly and primarily impacted by land and water development in the coastal zone resulting from such deepwater port. For the purposes of this chapter, a State shall be considered to be making reasonable progress if it is receiving a planning grant pursuant to section 305 of the Coastal Zone Management Act [16 U.S.C. 1454].
<br>(d) State agreements or compacts
<br>
<br>The consent of Congress is given to two or more coastal States to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law or treaty of the United States, (1) to apply for a license for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port or for the transfer of such license, and (2) to establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as are deemed necessary or appropriate for implementing and carrying out the provisions of any such agreement or compact.

<br>§1518. Relationship to other laws
<br>(a) Federal Constitution, laws, and treaties applicable; other Federal requirements applicable; status of deepwater port; Federal or State authorities and responsibilities within territorial seas unaffected; notification by Secretary of State of intent to exercise jurisdiction; objections by foreign governments
<br>
<br>(1) The Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States shall apply to a deepwater port licensed under this chapter and to activities connected, associated, or potentially interfering with the use or operation of any such port, in the same manner as if such port were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve, exempt, or immunize any person from any other requirement imposed by Federal law, regulation, or treaty. Deepwater ports licensed under this chapter do not possess the status of islands and have no territorial seas of their own.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall in any way alter the responsibilities and authorities of a State or the United States within the territorial seas of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of State shall notify the government of each foreign state having vessels registered under its authority or flying its flag which may call at or otherwise utilize a deepwater port but which do not currently have an agreement in effect as provided in subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) of this section that the United States intends to exercise jurisdiction over vessels calling at or otherwise utilizing a deepwater port and the persons on board such vessels. The Secretary of State shall notify the government of each such state that, absent its objection, its vessels will be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States whenever they—
<br>
<br>(A) are calling at or otherwise utilizing a deepwater port; and
<br>
<br>(B) are within the safety zone of such a deepwater port and are engaged in activities connected, associated, or potentially interfering with the use and operation of the deepwater port.
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State shall promptly inform licensees of deepwater ports of all objections received from governments of foreign states in response to notifications made under this paragraph.
<br>(b) Law of nearest adjacent coastal State as applicable Federal law; Federal administration and enforcement of such law; nearest adjacent coastal State defined
<br>
<br>The law of the nearest adjacent coastal State, now in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed, is declared to be the law of the United States, and shall apply to any deepwater port licensed pursuant to this chapter, to the extent applicable and not inconsistent with any provision or regulation under this chapter or other Federal laws and regulations now in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed. All such applicable laws shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the United States. For purposes of this subsection, the nearest adjacent coastal State shall be that State whose seaward boundaries, if extended beyond 3 miles, would encompass the site of the deepwater port.
<br>(c) Vessels of United States and foreign states subject to Federal jurisdiction; objections to jurisdiction; designation of agent for service of process; duty of licensee
<br>
<br>(1) The jurisdiction of the United States shall apply to vessels of the United States and persons on board such vessels. The jurisdiction of the United States shall also apply to vessels, and persons on board such vessels, registered in or flying the flags of foreign states, whenever such vessels are—
<br>
<br>(A) calling at or otherwise utilizing a deepwater port; and
<br>
<br>(B) are within the safety zone of such a deepwater port, and are engaged in activities connected, associated, or potentially interfering with the use and operation of the deepwater port.
<br>
<br>The jurisdiction of the United States under this paragraph shall not, however, apply to vessels registered in or flying the flag of any foreign state that has objected to the application of such jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>(2) Except in a situation involving force majeure, a licensee shall not permit a vessel registered in or flying the flag of a foreign state to call at or otherwise utilize a deepwater port licensed under this chapter unless—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) the foreign state involved, by specific agreement with the United States, has agreed to recognize the jurisdiction of the United States over the vessels registered in or flying the flag of that state and persons on board such vessels in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, while the vessel is located within the safety zone, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the foreign state has not objected to the application of the jurisdiction of the United States to any vessel, or persons on board such vessel, while the vessel is located within the safety zone; and
<br>
<br>(B) the vessel owner or operator has designated an agent in the United States for receipt of service of process in the event of any claim or legal proceeding resulting from activities of the vessel or its personnel while located within such a safety zone.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection, a licensee shall not be obliged to prohibit a call at or use of a deepwater port by a vessel registered in or flying the flag of an objecting state unless the licensee has been informed by the Secretary of State as required by subsection (a)(3) of this section.
<br>(d) Customs laws inapplicable to deepwater port; duties and taxes on foreign articles imported into customs territory of United States
<br>
<br>The customs laws administered by the Secretary of the Treasury shall not apply to any deepwater port licensed under this chapter, but all foreign articles to be used in the construction of any such deepwater port, including any component thereof, shall first be made subject to all applicable duties and taxes which would be imposed upon or by reason of their importation if they were imported for consumption in the United States. Duties and taxes shall be paid thereon in accordance with laws applicable to merchandise imported into the customs territory of the United States.
<br>(e) Federal district courts; original jurisdiction; venue
<br>
<br>The United States district courts shall have original jurisdiction of cases and controversies arising out of or in connection with the construction and operation of deepwater ports, and proceedings with respect to any such case or controversy may be instituted in the judicial district in which any defendant resides or may be found, or in the judicial district of the adjacent coastal State nearest the place where the cause of action arose.

<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>The original rules for the prevention of collisions on the water were contained in R.S. §4233, which consisted of 26 rules, R.S. §4412, which authorized the board of supervising inspectors to establish such regulations to be observed by all steam vessels in passing each other, as they should from time to time deem necessary for safety, and provided that copies of such regulations should be furnished to all of such vessels, to be kept posted up in conspicuous places in such vessels, and R.S. §4413, which prescribed a penalty for neglecting or willfully refusing to observe the regulations established pursuant to said section 4412.
<br>
<br>The rules prescribed by R.S. §4233 were superseded as to navigation on the high seas and in all coast waters of the United States, except such as were otherwise provided for, by the adoption of the "Revised International Regulations" by act March 3, 1885, ch. 354, 23 Stat. 438, which rules were superseded by the passage and adoption of act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, 26 Stat. 322, section 1 of which enacted a set of regulations for preventing collisions at sea to be followed by all public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith, navigable by seagoing vessels.
<br>
<br>Act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, §1, consisted of 31 articles. Section 2 of act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, repealed all laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the regulations for preventing collisions at sea for the navigation of all public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas, and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels, prescribed by section 1 of that act.
<br>
<br>The rules prescribed by R.S. §4233, were further superseded as to navigation on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal by act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, 28 Stat. 645, section 1 of which enacted rules for preventing collisions to be followed in the navigation of all public and private vessels of the United States upon the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal. Section 1 contained 28 articles. Section 2 of the act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, prescribed a fine for violations of the act. Section 3 of the act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, gave the Secretary of the Treasury authority to establish all necessary regulations not inconsistent with the act, necessary to carry the act into effect, and gave the Board of Supervising Inspectors of the United States authority to establish such regulations to be observed by all steam vessels in passing each other, not inconsistent with the act, as they should from time to time deem necessary, and provided that the regulations so adopted, when approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, should have the force of law. Section 4 of the act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, repealed all laws or parts of laws, so far as applicable to the navigation of the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal, inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the act.
<br>
<br>The rules prescribed by R.S. §4233, and by R.S. §§4412, 4414, and the regulations pursuant thereto, were required to be followed on the harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, and the provisions of said sections were made special rules, duly made by local authority, relative to the navigation of harbors, rivers, and inland waters, as provided for by article 30 of the act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, §1, by act Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102, §1, 28 Stat. 672. Section 2 of the act Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to designate and define by the suitable bearing or range with light houses, light vessels, buoys, or coast objects, the lines dividing the high seas from rivers, harbors, and inland waters. Section 3 of the act Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102, required collectors or other chief officers of the customs to require sail vessels to be furnished with proper signal lights, and prescribed a penalty to be assessed against vessels navigated without complying with the statutes of the United States, or the regulations lawfully made thereunder. Section 4 of the act Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102, provided that the words "inland waters" should not be held to include the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal, and provided that the act should not modify or affect the provisions of act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, which was the act prescribing rules for preventing collisions to be followed in the navigation of all public and private vessels upon the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal.
<br>
<br>The rules prescribed by R.S. §4233, were further superseded as to the navigation of all harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal and the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries, by act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, 30 Stat. 96, section 1 of which enacted a set of regulations for preventing collisions, to be followed by all vessels navigating all harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal and the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries. Said section 1 consisted of 31 articles. Section 2 of the act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, authorized the supervising inspectors of steam-vessels and the Supervising Inspector-General to establish rules to be observed by steam vessels in passing each other and as to the lights to be carried by ferry-boats and by barges and canal-boats, when in tow of steam-vessels, not inconsistent with the provisions of the act, such rules, when approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, to be special rules duly made by local authority, as provided for by article 30 of the act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, §1 which article provided that nothing in the rules contained in that act should interfere with the operation of special rules, duly made by local authority, relative to the navigation of any harbor, river, or inland waters. Section 3 of the act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, prescribed a penalty for violations of the provisions of the act or the regulations established pursuant to section 2. Section 4 of the act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, also prescribed a penalty to be assessed against vessels navigated without compliance with the provisions of the act. Section 5 of the act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, repealed R.S. §§4233, 4412 (with the regulations made in pursuance thereof, except the rules and regulations for the government of pilots of steamers navigating the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries, and except the rules for the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal), §4413, act March 3, 1893, ch. 202, 27 Stat. 557, which amended R.S. §4233, act Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102, §§1, 3, and act March 3, 1897, ch. 389, §§5, 12, 13, 29 Stat. 689, 690, and all amendments thereto insofar as the harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States (except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal and the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico, and their tributaries) were concerned.
<br>
<br>This legislation resulted in the following situation: Navigation on the high seas was governed by act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802, with its amendatory and supplementary acts, which was superseded by act Oct. 11, 1951, ch. 495, formerly set forth in chapter 2 of this title; navigation on all harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal and the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries, was governed by act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, as amended, formerly set forth in chapter 3 of this title; navigation on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal was governed by act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64, formerly set forth in section 301 et seq. of this title; and navigation on the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries was governed by R.S. §4233, as amended and supplemented, formerly set forth in section 301 et seq. of this title.
