<br>United States Competition for a World Expo
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 115–32, May 8, 2017, 131 Stat. 843, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) is the organization responsible for governing World Fairs and International Expositions.
<br>
<br>"(2) Section 1(a) of Public Law 91–269 (22 U.S.C. 2801(a)) found that 'international expositions . . . have a significant impact on the economic growth of the region surrounding the exposition and . . . are important instruments of national policy'.
<br>
<br>"(3) The United States has not been an active member of the BIE since 2001.
<br>
<br>"(4) State and local governments and private entities in the United States have continued to participate in international expositions held in foreign countries as a means of promoting United States exports and creating jobs, but face significantly higher costs for such participation because the United States is not an active member.
<br>
<br>"(5) State and local governments and private entities in the United States have expressed interest in an international exposition being hosted in the United States, but the bid of a United States city, region, or State to host an international exposition is unlikely to be successful if the United States is not a member of the BIE.
<br>"SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States should rejoin the BIE immediately to promote domestic job creation, global branding, and tourism to the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the Secretary of State, in partnership with the Secretary of Commerce, State and local governments, and private and non-profit entities, should take all necessary steps to facilitate the timely submission of a request to rejoin the BIE.
<br>"SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The Secretary of State is authorized to take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary for the United States to rejoin and maintain membership in the BIE.
<br>
<br>"(b) Authorization To Accept Private Contributions.—In addition to funds otherwise available to the Secretary to carry out this section, the Secretary is authorized to accept contributions for such purpose.
<br>
<br>"(c) Notification.—The Secretary of State shall notify the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the Senate upon taking any action under subsection (a).
<br>"SEC. 5. CONTINUATION OF PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR WORLD'S FAIR PAVILIONS AND EXHIBITS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Continuation of Prohibition.—Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize any obligation or expenditure prohibited by section 204 of the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (22 U.S.C. 2452b) (relating to limitations on the obligation or expenditure of funds by the Department of State for a United States pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or world's fair registered by the BIE).
<br>
<br>"(b) Prohibition on Solicitation of Funds.—[Amended this section.]"
<br>§2452c. Program to provide grants to American-sponsored schools in predominantly Muslim countries to provide scholarships
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) During the 2003–2004 school year, the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State is financially assisting 189 elementary and secondary schools in foreign countries.
<br>
<br>(2) United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools are located in more than 20 countries with predominantly Muslim populations in the Near East, Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, and East Asia.
<br>
<br>(3) United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools provide an American-style education in English, with curricula that typically include an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and analytical skills.
<br>(b) Statement of policy
<br>
<br>The United States has an interest in increasing the level of financial support provided to United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools in countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to—
<br>
<br>(1) increase the number of students in such countries who attend such schools;
<br>
<br>(2) increase the number of young people who may thereby gain at any early age an appreciation for the culture, society, and history of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(3) increase the number of young people who may thereby improve their proficiency in the English language.
<br>(c) Program
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State, acting through the Director of the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State, may conduct a program to make grants to United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools in countries with predominantly Muslim populations for the purpose of providing full or partial merit-based scholarships to students from lower-income and middle-income families of such countries to attend such schools.
<br>(d) Determination of eligible students
<br>
<br>For purposes of the program, a United States-sponsored elementary and secondary school that receives a grant under the program may establish criteria to be implemented by such school to determine what constitutes lower-income and middle-income families in the country (or region of the country, if regional variations in income levels in the country are significant) in which such school is located.
<br>(e) Restriction on use of funds
<br>
<br>Amounts appropriated to the Secretary of State pursuant to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (h) shall be used for the sole purpose of making grants under this section, and may not be used for the administration of the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State or for any other activity of the Office.
<br>(f) Voluntary participation
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to require participation in the program by a United States-sponsored elementary or secondary school in a predominantly Muslim country.
<br>(g) Report
<br>
<br>Not later than April 15, 2006, and April 15, 2008, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on the program. The report shall assess the success of the program, examine any obstacles encountered in its implementation, and address whether it should be continued, and if so, provide recommendations to increase its effectiveness.
<br>(h) Funding
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of State for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, such sums as necessary to implement the program under this section.
