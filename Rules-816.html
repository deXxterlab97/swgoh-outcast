<br>
<br>"(1) The incidence of arson or other destruction or vandalism of places of religious worship, and the incidence of violent interference with an individual's lawful exercise or attempted exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship pose a serious national problem.

<br>"(5) Congress has authority, pursuant to the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, to make acts of destruction or damage to religious property a violation of Federal law.
<br>
<br>"(6) Congress has authority, pursuant to section 2 of the 13th amendment to the Constitution, to make actions of private citizens motivated by race, color, or ethnicity that interfere with the ability of citizens to hold or use religious property without fear of attack, violations of Federal criminal law."

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on sections 581 and 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. §§5187, 5209; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §316, 49 Stat. 712).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates section 581 and part of section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.
<br>
<br>The punishment provision was drawn from said section 592 as being the latest expression of congressional intent, in preference to the provision of said section 581 which authorized a fine "not more than double the amount so countersigned and delivered and imprisonment not more than 15 years".
<br>
<br>The words "shall be guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>Likewise the words "upon conviction in any district court of the United States" were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only after conviction.
<br>
<br>(See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for statement of reasons for dividing said section 592 into three revised sections, with consequent changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.)
<br>

<br>
<br>Whoever, being a director, officer, or agent of a corporation created by Act of Congress, the charter of which has expired, or trustee thereof, or an agent of such trustee, or a person having in his possession or under his control the property of such corporation for the purpose of paying or redeeming its notes and obligations, knowingly issues, reissues, or utters as money, or in any other way knowingly puts in circulation any bill, note, check, draft, or other security purporting to have been made by any such corporation, or by any officer thereof, or purporting to have been made under authority derived therefrom, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 700; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes

<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §289 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §174, 35 Stat. 1122).
<br>
<br>The reference to persons aiding was omitted as unnecessary, since such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
<br>
<br>The last sentence excepting bona fide holders in due course was omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>Other changes in phraseology also were made.

<br>§336. Issuance of circulating obligations of less than $1
<br>
<br>Whoever makes, issues, circulates, or pays out any note, check, memorandum, token, or other obligation for a less sum than $1, intended to circulate as money or to be received or used in lieu of lawful money of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §293 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §178, 35 Stat. 1122).
<br>
<br>Numerous suggestions, of which that of Mr. E. M. Million, of Arlington, Va., is typical, recommend that this section be omitted as obsolete or revised to except commercial obligations. However, since the decisions make it plain that only obligations intended to circulate as money are within the provisions of this section and that commercial checks of less than $1 are not affected, there seems no reason so to rewrite the section. (See U.S. v. Monongahela Bridge Co., Fed. Cas. No. 15,796; Stettinius v. U.S., Fed. Cas. No. 13,387.)
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
