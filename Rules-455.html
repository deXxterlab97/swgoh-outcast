<br>(B) from an appraisal management company that either has registered with a State appraiser certifying and licensing agency in accordance with this chapter or operates as a subsidiary of a federally regulated financial institution, an annual registry fee of—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of such a company that has been in existence for more than a year, $25 multiplied by the number of appraisers working for or contracting with such company in such State during the previous year, but where such $25 amount may be adjusted, up to a maximum of $50, at the discretion of the Appraisal Subcommittee, if necessary to carry out the Subcommittee's functions under this chapter; and

The waiver terminates when the Appraisal Subcommittee determines that such significant delays have been eliminated.
<br>(c) Reports to State certifying and licensing agencies
<br>
<br>The Appraisal Subcommittee, any other Federal agency or instrumentality, or any federally recognized entity shall report any action of a State certified or licensed appraiser that is contrary to the purposes of this chapter, to the appropriate State agency for a disposition of the subject of the referral. The State agency shall provide the Appraisal Subcommittee or the other Federal agency or instrumentality with a report on its disposition of the matter referred.
