<br>"(H) In 1990, multiple data sources confirmed a trend of increased alcohol use by teenagers in the Troy community. Using its 'multiple strategies over multiple sectors' approach, the Troy Coalition worked with parents, physicians, students, coaches, and others to address this problem from several angles. As a result, the rate of twelfth grade students who had consumed alcohol in the past month decreased from 62.1 percent to 53.3 percent between 1991 and 1998, and the rate of eighth grade students decreased from 26.3 percent to 17.4 percent. The Troy Coalition believes that this decline represents not only a change in behavior on the part of students, but also a change in the norms of the community.
<br>
<br>"(6) Despite these successes, drug use continues to be a serious problem facing communities across the United States. For example:
<br>
<br>"(A) According to the Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse Mid-Year 2000 report—
<br>
<br>"(i) crack and powder cocaine remains the most serious drug problem;
<br>
<br>"(ii) marijuana remains the most widely available illicit drug, and its potency is on the rise;
<br>
<br>"(iii) treatment sources report an increase in admissions with marijuana as the primary drug of abuse—and adolescents outnumber other age groups entering treatment for marijuana;
<br>
<br>"(iv) 80 percent of Pulse Check sources reported increased availability of club drugs, with ecstasy (MDMA) and ketamine the most widely cited club drugs and seven sources reporting that powder cocaine is being used as a club drug by young adults;
<br>
<br>"(v) ecstasy abuse and trafficking is expanding, no longer confined to the 'rave' scene;
<br>
<br>"(vi) the sale and use of club drugs has grown from nightclubs and raves to high schools, the streets, neighborhoods, open venues, and younger ages;
<br>
<br>"(vii) ecstasy users often are unknowingly purchasing adulterated tablets or some other substance sold as MDMA; and
<br>
<br>"(viii) along with reports of increased heroin snorting as a route of administration for initiates, there is also an increase in injecting initiates and the negative health consequences associated with injection (for example, increases in HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C) suggesting that there is a generational forgetting of the dangers of injection of the drug.
<br>
<br>"(B) The 2000 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education study reported that 23.6 percent of children in the sixth through twelfth grades used illicit drugs in the past year. The same study found that monthly usage among this group was 15.3 percent.
<br>
<br>"(C) According to the 2000 Monitoring the Future study, the use of ecstasy among eighth graders increased from 1.7 percent in 1999 to 3.1 percent in 2000, among tenth graders from 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent, and from 5.6 percent to 8.2 percent among twelfth graders.
<br>
<br>"(D) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that—
<br>
<br>"(i) 56 percent of the population in the United States believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;
<br>
<br>"(ii) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as a serious problem in the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as a serious problem in their communities.
<br>
<br>"(7) According to the 2001 report of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University entitled 'Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State Budgets', using the most conservative assumption, in 1998 States spent $77,900,000,000 to shovel up the wreckage of substance abuse, only $3,000,000,000 to prevent and treat the problem and $433,000,000 for alcohol and tobacco regulation and compliance. This $77,900,000,000 burden was distributed as follows:
<br>
<br>"(A) $30,700,000,000 in the justice system (77 percent of justice spending).
<br>
<br>"(B) $16,500,000,000 in education costs (10 percent of education spending).
<br>
<br>"(C) $15,200,000,000 in health costs (25 percent of health spending).
<br>
<br>"(D) $7,700,000,000 in child and family assistance (32 percent of child and family assistance spending).
<br>
<br>"(E) $5,900,000,000 in mental health and developmental disabilities (31 percent of mental health spending).
<br>
<br>"(F) $1,500,000,000 in public safety (26 percent of public safety spending) and $400,000,000 for the state workforce.
<br>
<br>"(8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination through national, State, and local or tribal leadership and partnerships are critical to facilitate the reduction of substance abuse among youth in communities across the United States.
<br>
<br>"(9) Substance abuse is perceived as a much greater problem nationally than at the community level. According to a 2001 study sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts, between 1994 and 2000—
<br>
<br>"(A) there was a 43 percent increase in the percentage of Americans who felt progress was being made in the war on drugs at the community level;
<br>
<br>"(B) only 9 percent of Americans say drug abuse is a 'crisis' in their neighborhood, compared to 27 percent who say this about the nation; and
<br>
<br>"(C) the percentage of those who felt we lost ground in the war on drugs on a community level fell by more than a quarter, from 51 percent in 1994 to 37 percent in 2000."

<br>§1601. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) each year millions of citizens of the United States depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable within the human body;
<br>
<br>(2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and maintenance of the supply of the devices;
<br>
<br>(3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials and component parts that—
<br>
<br>(A) move in interstate commerce;
<br>
<br>(B) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use in medical devices; and
<br>
<br>(C) come in contact with internal human tissue;
<br>
<br>(4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in a variety of nonmedical products;
<br>
<br>(5) because small quantities of the raw materials and component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw materials and component parts for medical devices constitute an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw materials and component parts;
<br>
<br>(6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) manufacturers of medical devices are required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and effective, including demonstrating that the products are properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;
<br>
<br>(7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of actions alleging inadequate—
<br>
<br>(A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or
<br>
<br>(B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;
<br>
<br>(8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and component parts for use in medical devices for a number of reasons, including concerns about the costs of such litigation;
<br>
<br>(9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the unavailability of raw materials and component parts for medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices;
<br>
<br>(10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain medical devices in the United States, the prospects for development of new sources of supply for the full range of threatened raw materials and component parts for medical devices are remote;
<br>
<br>(11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw materials and component parts in the United States could support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers of such raw materials and component parts;
<br>
<br>(12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the cost of medical devices;
<br>
<br>(13) courts that have considered the duties of the suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty—
<br>
<br>(A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw material or component part in a medical device; or
<br>
<br>(B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and effectiveness of a medical device;
<br>
<br>(14) because medical devices and the raw materials and component parts used in their manufacture move in interstate commerce, a shortage of such raw materials and component parts affects interstate commerce;
<br>
<br>(15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, immediate action is needed—
<br>
<br>(A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical devices; and
<br>
<br>(B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to minimize litigation costs;
<br>
<br>(16) the several States and their courts are the primary architects and regulators of our tort system; Congress, however, must, in certain circumstances involving the national interest, address tort issues, and a threatened shortage of raw materials and component parts for lifesaving medical devices is one such circumstance; and
<br>
<br>(17) the protections set forth in this chapter are needed to assure the continued supply of materials for lifesaving medical devices, although such protections do not protect negligent suppliers.
