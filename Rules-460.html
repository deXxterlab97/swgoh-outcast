settlement agreement that was executed between the owner and the Secretary prior to September 1, 1995; (2) whose submissions were delayed as a result of their location in areas that were designated as a Federal disaster area in a Presidential Disaster Declaration; or (3) whose processing was, in fact or in practical effect, suspended, deferred, or interrupted for a period of twelve months or more because of differing interpretations, by the Secretary and an owner or by the Secretary and a State or local rent regulatory agency, concerning the timing of filing eligibility or the effect of a presumptively applicable State or local rent control law or regulation on the determination of preservation value under section 213 of LIHPRHA, as amended [12 U.S.C. 4103], if the owner of such project filed notice of intent to extend the low-income affordability restrictions of the housing, or transfer to a qualified purchaser who would extend such restrictions, on or before November 1, 1993; and of which, up to $100,000,000 may be used for rental assistance to prevent displacement of families residing in projects whose owners prepay their mortgages; and the balance of which shall be available from the effective date of this Act [Sept. 26, 1996] for sales to preferred priority purchasers: Provided further, That with the exception of projects described in clauses (1), (2), or (3)

as said owner agrees not to raise rents for sixty days after such prepayment: Provided further, That such developments have been determined to have preservation equity at least equal to the lesser of $5,000 per unit or $500,000 per project or the equivalent of eight times the most recently published monthly fair market rent for the area in which the project is located as the appropriate unit size for all of the units in the eligible project: Provided further, That the Secretary may modify the regulatory agreement to permit owners and priority purchasers to retain rental income in excess of the basic rental charge in projects assisted under section 236 of the National Housing Act, for the purpose of preserving the low- and moderate-income character of the housing: Provided further, That eligible low-income housing shall include properties meeting the requirements of this paragraph with mortgages that are held by a State agency as a result of a sale by the Secretary without insurance, which immediately before the sale would have been eligible low-income housing under LIHPRHA: Provided further, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, each low-income family, and moderate-income family who is elderly or disabled or is residing in a low-vacancy area, residing in the housing on the date of prepayment or voluntary

assistance in accordance with section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] or any successor program, under which the family shall pay no less for rent than it paid on such date: Provided further, That any family receiving tenant-based assistance under the preceding proviso may elect (1) to remain in the unit of the housing and if the rent exceeds the fair market rent or payment standard, as applicable, the rent shall be deemed to be the applicable standard, so long as the administering public housing agency finds that the rent is reasonable in comparison with rents charged for comparable unassisted housing units in the market or (2) to move from the housing and the rent will be subject to the fair market rent of the payment standard, as applicable, under existing program rules and procedures: Provided further, That the tenant-based assistance made available under the preceding two provisos are in lieu of benefits provided in subsections [sic] 223(b), (c), and (d) of the Low-Income Housing

capital grant shall be limited to seven times, and any capital loan limited to six times, the annual fair market rent for the project, as determined using the fair market rent for fiscal year 1997 for

greater amount is necessary and appropriate to preserve low-income housing: Provided further, That section 241(f) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715z–6(f)] is repealed and insurance under such section shall not be offered as an incentive under LIHPRHA and ELIHPA: Provided further, That up to $10,000,000 of the amount of $350,000,000 made available by a preceding proviso in this paragraph may be used at the discretion of the Secretary to reimburse owners of eligible properties for which plans of action were submitted prior to the effective date of this Act [Sept. 26, 1996], but were not executed for lack of available funds, with such reimbursement available only for documented costs directly applicable to the preparation of the plan of action as determined by the Secretary, and shall be made available on terms and conditions to be established by the Secretary: Provided further, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a priority purchaser may utilize assistance under the HOME Investment Partnerships Act [42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.] or the Low Income Housing Tax Credit [see 26 U.S.C. 42]: Provided further, That projects with approved plans of action which exceed the limitations on eligibility for funding imposed by this Act may submit revised plans of action which conform to these limitations by March 1, 1997, and retain the priority for funding otherwise applicable from the original date of approval of their plan of action, subject to securing any additional necessary funding commitments by August 1, 1997."

<br>§4103. Appraisal and preservation value of eligible low-income housing
<br>(a) Appraisal
<br>
<br>Upon receiving notice of intent regarding an eligible low-income housing project indicating an intent to extend the low-income affordability restrictions under section 4109 of this title or transfer the housing under section 4110 of this title, the Secretary shall provide for determination of the preservation value of the housing, as follows:
<br>(1) Appraisers
<br>
<br>The preservation value shall be determined by 2 independent appraisers, one of whom shall be selected by the Secretary and one of whom shall be selected by the owner. The appraisals shall be conducted not later than 4 months after filing the notice of intent under section 4102 of this title, and the owner shall submit to the Secretary the appraisal made by the owner's selected appraiser not later than 90 days after receipt of the notice under paragraph (2). If the 2 appraisers fail to agree on the preservation value, and the Secretary and the owner also fail to agree on the preservation value, the Secretary and the owner shall jointly select and jointly compensate a third appraiser, whose appraisal shall be binding on the parties.
<br>(2) Notice
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the filing of a notice of intent to seek incentives under section 4109 of this title or transfer the property under section 4110 of this title, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the owner filing the notice of intent of—
<br>
<br>(A) the need for the owner to acquire an appraisal of the property under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) the rules and guidelines for such appraisals;
<br>
<br>(C) the filing deadline for submission of the appraisal under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(D) the need for an appraiser retained by the Secretary to inspect the housing and project financial records; and
<br>
<br>(E) any delegation to the appropriate State agency by the Secretary of responsibilities regarding the appraisal.
<br>(3) Timeliness
<br>
<br>The Secretary may approve a plan of action to receive incentives under section 4109 or 4110 of this title only based upon an appraisal conducted in accordance with this subsection that is not more than 30 months old.
<br>(b) Preservation value
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subchapter, the preservation value of eligible low-income housing appraised under this section shall be—
<br>
<br>(1) for purposes of extending the low-income affordability restrictions and receiving incentives under section 4109 of this title, the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best use of the property as residential rental housing; and
<br>
<br>(2) for purposes of transferring the property under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, the fair market value of the housing based on the highest and best use of the property.
<br>(c) Guidelines
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide written guidelines for appraisals of preservation value, which shall assume repayment of the existing federally assisted mortgage, termination of the existing low-income affordability restrictions, simultaneous termination of any Federal rental assistance, and costs of compliance with any State or local laws of general applicability. The guidelines may permit reliance upon assessments of rehabilitation needs and other conversion costs determined by an appropriate State agency, as determined by the Secretary. The guidelines shall instruct the appraiser to use the greater of actual project operating expenses at the time of the appraisal (based on the average of the actual project operating expenses during the preceding 3 years) or projected operating expenses after conversion in determining preservation value. The guidelines established by the Secretary shall not be inconsistent with customary appraisal standards. The guidelines shall also meet the following requirements:
<br>(1) Residential rental value
<br>
<br>In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(1), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to market-rate rental housing and shall establish methods for (A) determining rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to bring the housing up to quality standards required to attract and sustain a market rate tenancy upon conversion, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to market-rate multifamily rental housing.
<br>(2) Highest and best use value
<br>
<br>In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(2), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to highest and best use for the property and shall establish methods for (A) determining any rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to convert the housing to such use, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to its highest and best use.

<br>§4104. Annual authorized return and preservation rents
<br>(a) Annual authorized return
<br>
<br>Pursuant to an appraisal under section 4103 of this title, the Secretary shall determine the annual authorized return on the appraised housing, which shall be equal to 8 percent of the preservation equity (as such term is defined in section 4119(8) of this title).
<br>(b) Preservation rents
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall also determine the aggregate preservation rents under this subsection for each project appraised under section 4103 of this title. The aggregate preservation rents shall be used solely for the purposes of comparison with Federal cost limits under section 4105 of this title. Actual rents received by an owner (or a qualified purchaser) shall be determined pursuant to section 4109, 4110, or 4111 of this title. The aggregate preservation rents shall be established as follows:
<br>(1) Extension of affordability limits
<br>
<br>The aggregate preservation rent for purposes of receiving incentives pursuant to extension of the low-income affordability restrictions under section 4109 of this title shall be the gross potential income for the project, determined by the Secretary, that would be required to support the following costs:
<br>
<br>(A) The annual authorized return determined under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(B) Debt service on any rehabilitation loan for the housing.
<br>
<br>(C) Debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage for the housing.
<br>
<br>(D) Project operating expenses.
<br>
<br>(E) Adequate reserves.
<br>(2) Sale
<br>
<br>The aggregate preservation rent for purposes of receiving incentives pursuant to sale under section 4110 or 4111 of this title shall be the gross income for the project determined by the Secretary, that would be required to support the following costs:
<br>
<br>(A) Debt service on the loan for acquisition of the housing.
<br>
<br>(B) Debt service on any rehabilitation loan for the housing.
<br>
<br>(C) Debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage for the housing.
<br>
<br>(D) Project operating expenses.
<br>
<br>(E) Adequate reserves.
<br>(c) Future financing
<br>
<br>Neither this section, nor any plan of action or use agreement implementing this section, shall restrict an owner from obtaining a new loan or refinancing an existing loan secured by the project, or from distributing the proceeds of such a loan; except that, in conjunction with such refinancing—
<br>
<br>(1) the owner shall provide for adequate rehabilitation pursuant to a capital needs assessment to ensure long-term sustainability of the property satisfactory to the lender or bond issuance agency;
<br>
<br>(2) any resulting budget-based rent increase shall include debt service on the new financing, commercially reasonable debt service coverage, and replacement reserves as required by the lender; and
<br>
<br>(3) for tenants of dwelling units not covered by a project- or tenant-based rental subsidy, any rent increases resulting from the refinancing transaction may not exceed 10 percent per year, except that—
<br>
<br>(A) any tenant occupying a dwelling unit as of time of the refinancing may not be required to pay for rent and utilities, for the duration of such tenancy, an amount that exceeds the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) 30 percent of the tenant's income; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount paid by the tenant for rent and utilities immediately before such refinancing; and
<br>
<br>(B) this paragraph shall not apply to any tenant who does not provide the owner with proof of income.
<br>
<br>Paragraph (3) may not be construed to limit any rent increases resulting from increased operating costs for a project.

G, title LXXVII, §77003, Dec. 4, 2015, 129 Stat. 1791, provided that: "The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall issue any guidance that the Secretary considers necessary to carry out the provisions added by the amendments made by this title [amending this section and section 4112 of this title] not later than the expiration of the 120-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 4, 2015]."
<br>§4105. Federal cost limits and limitations on plans of action
<br>(a) Determination of relationship to Federal cost limits
<br>(1) Initial determination
<br>
<br>For each eligible low-income housing project appraised under section 4103(a) of this title, the Secretary shall determine whether the aggregate preservation rents for the project determined under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 4104(b) of this title exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the fair market rental (established under section 1437f(c) of title 42) for the market area in which the housing is located by the number of dwelling units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes).
<br>(2) Relevant local markets
<br>
<br>If the aggregate preservation rents for a project exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine whether such aggregate rents exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to the appropriate unit sizes). A relevant local market area shall be an area geographically smaller than a market area established by the Secretary under section 1437f(c)(1) of title 42 that is identifiable as a distinct rental market area. The Secretary may rely on the appraisal to determine the relevant local market areas and prevailing rents in such local areas and any other information the Secretary determines is appropriate.
<br>(3) Effect
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subchapter, the aggregate preservation rents shall be considered to exceed the Federal cost limits under this subsection only if the aggregate preservation rents exceed the amount determined under paragraph (1) and the amount determined under paragraph (2).
<br>(b) Limitations on action pursuant to Federal cost limits
<br>(1) Housing within Federal cost limits
<br>
<br>If the aggregate preservation rents for an eligible low-income housing project do not exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner may not prepay the mortgage on the housing or terminate the insurance contract with respect to the housing, except as permitted under section 4114 of this title. The owner may—
<br>
<br>(A) file a plan of action under section 4107 of this title to receive incentives under section 4109 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) file a second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title indicating an intention to transfer the housing under section 4110 of this title and take actions pursuant to such section.
<br>(2) Housing exceeding Federal cost limits
<br>
<br>If the aggregate preservation rents for an eligible low-income housing project exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner may—
<br>
<br>(A) file a plan of action under section 4107 of this title to receive incentives under section 4109 of this title if the owner agrees to accept incentives under such sections in an amount that shall not exceed the Federal cost limit;
<br>
<br>(B) file a second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title indicating an intention to transfer the housing under section 4110 of this title and take actions pursuant to such section if the owner agrees to transfer the housing at a price that shall not exceed the Federal cost limit; or
<br>
<br>(C) file a second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title indicating an intention to prepay the mortgage or voluntarily terminate the insurance, subject to the mandatory sale provisions under section 4111 of this title.

<br>§4108. Prepayment and voluntary termination
<br>(a) Approval
<br>
<br>The Secretary may approve a plan of action that provides for termination of the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of the mortgage insurance contract only upon a written finding that—
<br>
<br>(1) implementation of the plan of action will not—
<br>
<br>(A) materially increase economic hardship for current tenants, and will not in any event result in (i) a monthly rental payment by any current tenant that exceeds 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the tenant or an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds 10 percent (whichever is lower), or (ii) in the case of a current tenant who already pays more than such percentage, an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds the increase in the Consumer Price Index or 10 percent (whichever is lower); or
<br>
<br>(B) involuntarily displace current tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordable housing is not readily available determined without regard to the availability of Federal housing assistance that would address any such hardship or involuntary displacement; and
<br>
<br>(2) the supply of vacant, comparable housing is sufficient to ensure that such prepayment will not materially affect—
<br>
<br>(A) the availability of decent, safe, and sanitary housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families or persons in the area that the housing could reasonably be expected to serve;
<br>
<br>(B) the ability of low-income and very low-income families or persons to find affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing near employment opportunities; or
<br>
<br>(C) the housing opportunities of minorities in the community within which the housing is located.
<br>(b) Standards and procedure for written findings
<br>(1) Standards
<br>
<br>A written finding under subsection (a) shall be based on an analysis of the evidence considered by the Secretary in reaching such finding and shall contain documentation of such evidence.
<br>(2) Procedure and criteria
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, develop (A) a procedure for determining whether the conditions under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) exist, (B) requirements for evidence on which such determinations are based, and (C) criteria on which such determinations are based.
<br>(c) Disapproval
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines a plan of action to prepay a mortgage or terminate an insurance contract fails to meet the requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary shall disapprove the plan, the notice of intent filed under section 4102 of this title by such owner shall not be effective for purposes of this subchapter, and the owner may, in order to receive incentives under this subchapter, file a new notice of intent under such section.

<br>§4109. Incentives to extend low-income use
<br>(a) Agreements by Secretary
<br>
<br>After approving a plan of action from an owner of eligible low-income housing that includes the owner's plan to extend the low-income affordability restrictions of the housing, the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations for such purpose, enter into such agreements as are necessary to enable the owner to receive (for each year after the approval of the plan of action) the annual authorized return for the housing determined under section 4104(a) of this title, pay debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage covering the housing, pay debt service on any loan for rehabilitation of the housing, and meet project operating expenses and establish adequate reserves. The Secretary shall take into account the Federal cost limits under section 4105(a) of this title for the housing when providing incentives under subsections 1 (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that owners receive the annual authorized return for the housing determined under section 4104(a) of this title during the period in which rent increases are phased in as provided in section 4112(a)(2)(E) of this title, including (in order of preference) (1) allowing the owner access to residual receipt accounts (pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section), (2) deferring remittance of excess rent payments, and (3) providing an increase in rents permitted under an existing contract under section 1437f of title 42 (pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section).
<br>(b) Permissible incentives
<br>
<br>Such agreements may include one or more of the following incentives:
<br>
<br>(1) Increased access to residual receipts accounts.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to the availability of amounts provided in appropriations Acts—
<br>
<br>(A) an increase in the rents permitted under an existing contract under section 1437f of title 42, or
<br>
<br>(B) additional assistance under section 1437f of title 42 or an extension of any project-based assistance attached to the housing; and

<br>
<br>With respect to any eligible low-income housing for which an owner has submitted a second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser, the owner shall offer the housing for transfer to qualified purchasers as provided in this section. The Secretary shall issue regulations describing the means by which potential qualified purchasers shall be notified of the availability of the housing for sale.

<br>For the 12-month period beginning on the receipt by the Secretary of a second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title with respect to such housing, the owner may offer to sell and negotiate a sale of the housing only with priority purchasers. The negotiated sale price may not exceed the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title. The owner or the purchaser shall submit a plan of action under section 4107 of this title for any sale under this subsection, which shall include any request for assistance under this section, upon the acceptance of any bona fide offer meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
<br>(2) Expression of interest
<br>
<br>During such period, priority purchasers may submit written notice to the Secretary stating their interest in acquiring the housing. Such notice shall be made in the form and include such information as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>(3) Information
<br>
<br>Within 30 days of receipt of an expression of interest by a priority purchaser, the Secretary shall provide such purchaser with information on the assistance available from the Federal Government to facilitate a transfer and the owner shall provide appropriate information on the housing, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(c) Right of refusal for other qualified purchasers
<br>
<br>If no bona fide offer to purchase any eligible low-income housing subject to this section that meets the requirements of subsection (b) is made and accepted during the period under such subsection, during the 3-month period beginning upon the expiration of the 12-month period under subsection (b)(1), the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to qualified purchasers. The negotiated sale price may not exceed the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title. The owner or purchaser shall submit a plan of action under section 4107 of this title for any sale under this subsection, which shall include any request for assistance under this section, upon the acceptance of any bona fide offer meeting the requirements of this paragraph.1
<br>(d) Assistance
<br>(1) Approval
<br>
<br>If the qualified purchaser is a resident council, the Secretary may not approve a plan of action for assistance under this section unless the council's proposed resident homeownership program meets the requirements under section 4116 of this title. For all other qualified purchasers, the Secretary may not approve the plan unless the Secretary finds that the criteria for approval under section 4112 of this title have been satisfied.
<br>(2) Amount
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, the Secretary shall, for approvable plans of action, provide assistance sufficient to enable qualified purchasers (including all priority purchasers other than resident councils acquiring under the homeownership program authorized by section 4116 of this title) to—
<br>
<br>(A) acquire the eligible low-income housing from the current owner for a purchase price not greater than the preservation equity of the housing;
<br>
<br>(B) pay the debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage covering the housing;
<br>
<br>(C) pay the debt service on any loan for the rehabilitation of the housing;
<br>
<br>(D) meet project operating expenses and establish adequate reserves for the housing, and in the case of a priority purchaser, meet project oversight costs;

<br>(E) receive a distribution equal to an 8 percent annual return on any actual cash investment (from sources other than assistance provided under this title 2) made to acquire or rehabilitate the project;
<br>
<br>(F) in the case of a priority purchaser, receive a reimbursement of all reasonable transaction expenses associated with the acquisition, loan closing, and implementation of an approved plan of action; and
<br>
<br>(G) in the case of an approved resident homeownership program, cover the costs of training for the resident council, homeownership counseling and training, the fees for the nonprofit entity or public agency working with the resident council and costs related to relocation of tenants who elect to move.
<br>(3) Incentives
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For all qualified purchasers of housing under this subsection, the Secretary may provide assistance for an approved plan of action in the form of 1 or more of the incentives authorized under section 4109(b) of this title, except that the incentive under such section 4109(b)(7) of this title may include an acquisition loan under section 1715z–6(f) 2 of this title.
<br>(B) Priority purchasers
<br>
<br>Where the qualified purchaser is a priority purchaser, the Secretary may provide assistance for an approved plan of action (in the form of a grant) for each unit in the housing in an amount, as determined by the Secretary, that does not exceed the present value of the total of the projected published fair market rentals for existing housing (established by the Secretary under section 1437f(c) of title 42) for the next 10 years (or such longer period if additional assistance is necessary to cover the costs referred to in paragraph (2)).

<br>§4111. Mandatory sale for housing exceeding Federal cost limits
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to any eligible low-income housing for which the aggregate preservation rents determined under section 4104(b) of this title exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner shall offer the housing for sale to qualified purchasers as provided in this section.
<br>(b) Right of first refusal to priority purchasers
<br>(1) Duration and required sale
<br>
<br>For the 12-month period beginning upon the receipt by the Secretary of the second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title with respect to such housing, the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to priority purchasers. If, during such period, a priority purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.
<br>(2) Expression of interest
<br>
<br>During the period under paragraph (1), priority purchasers shall have the opportunity to submit written notice to the owner and the Secretary stating their interest in acquiring the housing. Such written notice shall be in such form and include such information as the Secretary may prescribe.

If, during such period, a qualified purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.
<br>(d) Assistance
<br>(1) Federal cost limit
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, the Secretary shall, for approvable plans of action, provide to qualified purchasers assistance under section 1437f of title 42 sufficient to produce a gross income potential equal to the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes), and any other incentives authorized under section 4109(b) of this title that would have been provided to a qualified purchaser under section 4110 of this title.
<br>(2) Additional assistance
<br>
<br>From amounts made available under section 4124(b) of this title, the Secretary may make grants to assist in the completion of sales and transfers under this section to any qualified purchasers.

<br>§4112. Criteria for approval of plan of action involving incentives
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may approve a plan of action for extension of the low-income affordability restrictions on any eligible low-income housing or transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser (other than a resident council) only upon finding that—
<br>
<br>(1) due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of incentives is, for the Federal Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the full achievement of the purposes of this title; 1
<br>
<br>(2) binding commitments have been made to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) the housing will be retained as housing affordable for very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons for the remaining useful life of such housing (as determined under subsection (c));
<br>
<br>(B) throughout such period, adequate expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the housing and that the project meets housing standards established by the Secretary under subsection (d), as determined by inspections conducted under such subsection by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(C) current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);
<br>
<br>(D) any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42, whichever is lower, except that the rent contributions of any tenants occupying the housing at the time of any increase may not be reduced by reason of this subparagraph (except with respect to tenants receiving section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] assistance in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii) of this paragraph);
<br>
<br>(E)(i) any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs)—
<br>
<br>(I) shall be phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and
<br>
<br>(II) shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent; and
<br>
<br>(ii) assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriation Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effect on current income-eligible very low- and low-income tenants; and 2
<br>
<br>(F)(i) rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at levels approved by the Secretary that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same proportions of very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons (including families or persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income) as resided in the housing as of January 1, 1987 (based on the area median income limits established by the Secretary in February 1987), or the date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low-income families, except that this limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low-income families from occupying the housing; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in approving rents under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account any additional incentives provided under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(G) future rent adjustments shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) made by applying an annual factor (to be determined by the Secretary) to the portion of rent attributable to operating expenses for the housing and, where the owner is a priority purchaser, to the portion of rent attributable to project oversight costs; and
<br>
<br>(ii) subject to a procedure, established by the Secretary, for owners to apply for rent increases not adequately compensated by annual adjustment under clause (i), under which the Secretary may increase rents in excess of the amount determined under clause (i) only if the Secretary determines such increases are necessary to reflect extraordinary necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the housing; and
<br>
<br>(H) any savings from reductions in operating expenses due to management efficiencies shall be deposited in project reserves for replacement and the owner shall have periodic access to such reserves, to the extent the Secretary determines that the level of reserves is adequate and that the housing is maintained in accordance with the standards established under subsection (d); and
<br>
<br>(3) no incentives under section 4109 of this title (other than to purchasers under section 4110 of this title) may be provided until the Secretary determines the project meets housing standards under subsection (d), except that incentives under such section and other incentives designed to correct deficiencies in the project may be provided.
<br>(b) Implementation
<br>
<br>Any agreement to maintain the low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the housing may be made through execution of a new regulatory agreement, modifications to the existing regulatory agreement or mortgage, or, in the case of the prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of mortgage insurance, a recorded instrument.
<br>(c) Determination of remaining useful life
<br>(1) "Remaining useful life" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this title,1 the term "remaining useful life" means, with respect to eligible low-income housing, the period during which the physical characteristics of the housing remain in a condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and repairs are made and major systems and capital components are replaced as becomes necessary.
<br>(2) Standards
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by rule under section 553 of title 5, establish standards for determining when the useful life of an eligible low-income housing project has expired. The determination shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
<br>(3) Owner petition
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish a procedure under which owners of eligible low-income housing may petition the Secretary for a determination that the useful life of such housing has expired. The procedure shall not permit such a petition before the expiration of the 50-year period beginning upon the approval of a plan of action under this subchapter with respect to such housing. In making a determination pursuant to a petition under this paragraph, the Secretary shall presume that the useful life of the housing has not expired, and the owner shall have the burden of proof in establishing such expiration. The Secretary may not determine that the useful life of any housing has expired if such determination results primarily from failure to make regular and reasonable repairs and replacement, as became necessary.
<br>(4) Tenant and community comment and appeal
<br>
<br>In making a determination regarding the useful life of any housing pursuant to a petition submitted under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall provide for comment by tenants of the housing and interested persons and organizations with respect to the petition. The Secretary shall also provide the tenants and interested persons and organizations with an opportunity to appeal a determination under this subsection.
<br>(d) Housing standards
<br>(1) Establishment and inspection
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish standards regarding the physical condition in which any eligible low income housing project receiving incentives under this subchapter shall be maintained. The Secretary shall inspect each such project not less than annually to ensure that the project is in compliance with such standards.
<br>(2) Sanctions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall take any action appropriate to require the owner of any housing not in compliance with such standards to bring such housing into compliance with the standards, including—
<br>
<br>(i) directing the mortgagee, with respect to an equity take-out loan under section 1715z–6(f) 1 of this title, to withhold the disbursement to the owner of any escrowed loan proceeds and requiring that such proceeds be used for repair of the housing; and
<br>
<br>(ii) reduce the amount of the annual authorized return, as determined by the Secretary, for the period ending upon a determination by the Secretary that the project is in compliance with the standards and requiring that such amounts be used for repair.
<br>(B) Continued compliance
<br>
<br>To ensure continued compliance with the standards for a project subject to any action under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may also limit access of the owner to such amounts and use of such amounts for not more than the 2-year period beginning upon the determination that the project is in compliance with the standards.
<br>(C) Removal of assistance
<br>
<br>If, upon inspection, the Secretary determines that any eligible low income housing project has failed to comply with the standards established under this subsection for 2 consecutive years, the Secretary may take 1 or more of the following actions:
<br>
<br>(i) Subject to availability of amounts provided in appropriations Acts, provide assistance under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(o) of title 42 (other than project-based assistance attached to the housing) for any tenant eligible for such assistance who desires to terminate occupancy in the housing. For each unit in the housing vacated pursuant to the provision of assistance under this clause, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other law or contract for assistance, cancel the provision of project-based assistance attached to the housing for 1 dwelling unit, if the housing is receiving such assistance.
<br>
<br>(ii) In the case of housing for which an equity take-out loan has been made under section 1715z–6(f) 1 of this title, declare such loan to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.
<br>
<br>(iii) Declare any rehabilitation loan insured or provided by the Secretary (with respect to the housing) to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.
<br>
<br>(iv) Suspend payments under or terminate any contract for project-based rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42.
<br>
<br>(v) Take any other action authorized by law or the project regulatory agreement to ensure that the housing will be brought into compliance with the standards established under this subsection.
<br>(e) Distribution and residual receipts
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>After December 4, 2015, the owner of a property subject to a plan of action or use agreement pursuant to this section shall be entitled to distribute—
<br>
<br>(A) annually, all surplus cash generated by the property, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement including compliance with prevailing physical condition standards established by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(B) notwithstanding any conflicting provision in such use agreement, any funds accumulated in a residual receipts account, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement and has completed, or set aside sufficient funds for completion of, any capital repairs identified by the most recent third party capital needs assessment.
<br>(2) Operation of property
<br>
<br>An owner that distributes any amounts pursuant to paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) continue to operate the property in accordance with the affordability provisions of the use agreement for the property for the remaining useful life of the property;
<br>
<br>(B) as required by the plan of action for the property, continue to renew or extend any project-based rental assistance contract for a term of not less than 20 years; and
<br>
<br>(C) if the owner has an existing multi-year project-based rental assistance contract for less than 20 years, have the option to extend the contract to a 20-year term.

Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any conflict pertaining to the computation of contract rents arising from differences between this subchapter and section 1437f of title 42 shall, subject to the prior approval of the Secretary, be resolved in favor of this subchapter; and", was executed by making the amendments to par. (2)(E)(ii) to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See Effective and Termination Dates of 1994 Amendment note below.

<br>
<br>"(aa) 30 percent of 45 percent of median income for the area (as determined by the Secretary and adjusted for family size); or
<br>
<br>"(bb) 90 percent of the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the eligible low-income housing is located.
<br>
<br>Subject to subclause (II), payment of this minimum rent shall be a condition of continued occupancy and eligibility for section 8 assistance.
<br>
<br>"(II) Notwithstanding the rents required under subclause (I), a tenant who occupies a unit designated for occupancy by low-income persons and families, and who becomes a very low-income tenant, shall be provided with the next available unit designated for occupancy by very low-income persons and families, and, until such unit becomes available, shall pay for rent not more than the amount chargeable as rent under section 1437a(a) of title 42. Such tenant shall not be evicted for nonpayment of rent if the rent amounts set forth in this subclause are paid. The costs resulting from the difference between rents required under subclause (I) and the rents permitted under this subclause shall be incorporated into the section 8 contract for units designated for occupancy by low-income persons or families; and".

(ii) read as follows: "in order to maintain the proportions of very low- and low-income families and persons required by clause (i), owners shall be required to apply any required Federal preference rules only with respect to tenants within each low- or very low-income category, in accordance with the approved tenant profile; and".

To prevent payment of windfall profits, the Secretary may make available incentive payments under section 4109 or 4110 of this title only to owners in those rental markets where there is an inadequate supply of decent, affordable housing, if the Secretary determines that adequate data can be obtained to permit objective and fair implementation or where necessary to accomplish the other public policy objectives under this chapter.

<br>§4113. Assistance for displaced tenants
<br>(a) Section 1437f assistance
<br>
<br>Each low-income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of an insurance contract on eligible low income housing shall, subject to the availability or 1 amounts provided under appropriations Acts, receive tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of title 42. To the extent sufficient amounts are made available under appropriations Acts, in each fiscal year the Secretary shall reserve from amounts made available under section 4124(a) of this title or, if necessary, under section 1437c(c) of title 42, such amounts as the Secretary determines are necessary to provide assistance payments for low-income families displaced during the fiscal year.
<br>(b) Relocation assistance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall coordinate with public housing agencies to ensure that any very low- or low-income family displaced from eligible low-income housing as the result of the prepayment of the mortgage (or termination of the mortgage insurance contract) on such housing is able to acquire a suitable, affordable dwelling unit in the area of the housing from which the family is displaced. The Secretary shall require the owner of such housing to pay 50 percent of the moving expenses of each family relocated, except that such percentage shall be increased to the extent that State or local law of general applicability requires a higher payment by the owner.
<br>(c) Continued occupancy
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each owner that prepays the mortgage (or terminates the mortgage insurance contract) on eligible low-income housing shall, as provided in paragraph (3), allow the tenants occupying units in such housing on the date of the submission of notice of intent under section 4102 of this title to remain in the housing for a period of 3 years, at rent levels (except for increases necessary for increased operating costs) existing at the time of prepayment.
<br>(2) Provision of assistance by owner
<br>
<br>In any case in which the Secretary requires an owner to allow tenants to occupy units under paragraph (1), an owner may fulfill the requirements of such paragraph by providing such assistance necessary for the tenant to rent a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in another project for the same period and at a rental cost to the tenant not in excess of the rental amount the tenant would have been required to pay in the housing of the owner, except that the tenant must freely agree to waive the right to occupy the unit in the owner's housing.
<br>(3) Applicability to low-vacancy areas and special needs tenants
<br>
<br>The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to—
<br>
<br>(A) eligible low income housing located in a low-vacancy area (as such term is defined by the Secretary); and
<br>
<br>(B) tenants in any eligible low-income housing in any area who have special needs restricting their ability to relocate (including elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities), as determined under regulations established by the Secretary.
<br>(d) Required acceptance of section 1437f assistance
<br>
<br>An owner who prepays the mortgage (or terminates the mortgage insurance contract) on eligible low-income housing and maintains the housing for residential rental occupancy may not refuse to rent, refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the rent of a dwelling unit in such property to any person, or discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of a dwelling (or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith), because the person receives assistance under section 1437f of title 42.
<br>(e) Regional pools
<br>
<br>In providing assistance under this section, the Secretary shall allocate the assistance on a regional basis through the regional offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Secretary shall allocate assistance under this section in a manner so that the total number of assisted units in each such region available for occupancy by, and affordable to, lower income families and persons does not decrease because of the prepayment or payment of a mortgage on eligible low-income housing or the termination of an insurance contract on such housing.
<br>(f) Enhanced voucher assistance for certain tenants
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>In lieu of benefits under subsections (b), (c), and (d), and subject to the availability of appropriated amounts, each family described in paragraph (2) shall be offered enhanced voucher assistance under section 1437f(t) of title 42.
<br>(2) Eligible families
<br>
<br>A family described in this paragraph is a family that is—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) a low-income family; or

<br>§4114. Permissible prepayment or voluntary termination and modification of commitments
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any limitations on prepayment or voluntary termination under this subchapter, an owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with the provisions of section 4113 of this title, under one of the following circumstances:
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4109(a) of this title, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan during the 15-month period beginning on the date of approval.
<br>
<br>(B) After the date that the housing would have been eligible for prepayment pursuant to the terms of the mortgage (notwithstanding this subchapter), the Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 6-month period beginning on the date of approval.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title for any eligible low-income housing not covered by subparagraph (B), but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of approval.
<br>
<br>(2) An owner who intended to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, and fully complied with the provisions of such section, did not receive any bona fide offers from any qualified purchasers within the applicable time periods.
<br>
<br>In the event that the purchaser under the plan of action is unable to consummate the purchase for reasons other than the failure of the Secretary to provide incentives, an owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination subject to the provisions of sections 4110 and 4111 of this title.
<br>(b) Section 1437f rental assistance
<br>
<br>When providing rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42, the Secretary may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations Acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. The contract and the approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Secretary is unable to extend the term of such rental assistance or is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Secretary, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions (subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs):
<br>(1) Modification of commitments
<br>
<br>Modify the binding commitments made pursuant to section 4112(a)(2) of this title that are dependent on such rental assistance.
<br>(2) Termination of plan of action
<br>
<br>Permit the owner to prepay the mortgage and terminate the plan of action and any implementing use agreements or restrictions, but only if the owner agrees in writing to comply with provisions of section 4113 of this title.
<br>
<br>At least 30 days before making a request under this subsection, an owner shall notify the Secretary of the owner's intention to submit the request. The Secretary shall have a period of 90 days following receipt of such notice to take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under section 4112(a)(2) of this title.

<br>§4115. Timetable for approval of plan of action
<br>(a) Notification of deficiencies
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after receipt of a plan of action, the Secretary shall notify the owner in writing of any deficiencies that prevent the plan of action from being approved. If deficiencies are found, such notice shall describe alternative ways in which the plan may be revised to meet the criteria for approval.
<br>(b) Notification of approval
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after receipt of a plan of action, or such longer period as the owner requests, the Secretary shall notify the owner in writing whether the plan of action, including any revisions, is approved. If approval is withheld, the notice shall describe—
<br>
<br>(A) the reasons for withholding approval; and
<br>
<br>(B) the actions that could be taken to meet the criteria for approval.
<br>(2) Opportunity to revise

<br>The Secretary shall subsequently give the owner a reasonable opportunity to revise the plan of action and seek approval.
<br>(c) Delayed approval

The preceding sentence shall not apply if the plan of action was not approved because of deficiencies. An owner may bring an action in the appropriate Federal district court to enforce this subsection.

<br>§4116. Resident homeownership program
<br>(a) Formation of resident council
<br>
<br>Tenants seeking to purchase eligible low-income housing in accordance with section 4110 of this title shall organize a resident council for the purpose of developing a resident homeownership program in accordance with standards established by the Secretary. The resident council shall work with a public or private nonprofit organization or a public body (including an agency or instrumentality thereof). Such organization or public body shall have experience to enable it to help the tenants consider their options and to develop the capacity necessary to own and manage the housing, where appropriate, and shall be approved by the Secretary.
<br>(b) Other program requirements and limitations
<br>(1) Sales to residents
<br>
<br>As a condition of approval of a plan of action involving homeownership program under this subchapter, the resident council shall prepare a workable plan acceptable to the Secretary for giving all residents an opportunity to become owners, which plan shall identify—
<br>
<br>(A) the price at which the resident council intends to transfer ownership interests in, or shares representing, units in the housing;
<br>
<br>(B) the factors that will influence the establishment of such price;
<br>
<br>(C) how such price compares to the estimated appraised value of the ownership interests or shares;
<br>
<br>(D) the underwriting standard the resident council plans to use (or reasonably expects a public or private lender to use) for potential tenant purchasers;
<br>
<br>(E) the financing arrangements the tenants are expected to pursue or be provided; and
<br>
<br>(F) a workable schedule of sale (subject to the limitations of paragraph (8)) based on estimated tenant incomes.
<br>(2) Approval of method of conversion and limitation on conditions of approval
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall approve the method for converting the housing to homeownership, which may involve acquisition of ownership interests in, or shares representing, the units in a project under any arrangement determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, such as cooperative ownership (including limited equity cooperative ownership) and fee simple ownership (including condominium ownership). The Secretary may not require the prepayment of the mortgage on eligible low-income housing for the approval of a plan of action involving a homeownership program for the housing.
<br>(3) Required conditions
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require that the form of homeownership impose appropriate conditions, including conditions to assure that—
<br>
<br>(A) the number of initial owners that are very low-income, lower income, or moderate-income persons at initial occupancy meet standards required or approved by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(B) occupancy charges payable by the owners meet requirements established by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(C) the aggregate incomes of initial and subsequent owners and other sources of funds for the project are sufficient to permit occupancy charges to cover the full operating costs of the housing and any debt service;
<br>
<br>(D) each initial owner occupies the unit it acquires; and
<br>
<br>(E) the low-income affordability restrictions shall continue to apply to any rental units in the housing for any period during which such units remain rental units.
<br>(4) Use of proceeds from sales to eligible families
<br>
<br>The entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, may use 50 percent of the proceeds, if any, from the initial sale for costs of the homeownership program, including improvements to the project, operating and replacement reserves for the project, additional homeownership opportunities in the project, and other project-related activities approved by the Secretary. The remaining 50 percent of such proceeds shall be returned to the Secretary for use under section 4110 of this title, subject to availability under appropriations Acts. Such entity shall keep, and make available to the Secretary, all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Secretary under this paragraph.
<br>(5) Restrictions on resale by homeowners
<br>(A) In general
<br>(i) Transfer permitted
<br>
<br>A homeowner under a homeownership program may transfer the homeowner's ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit, except that a homeownership program may establish restrictions on the resale of units under the program.
<br>(ii) Right to purchase
<br>
<br>Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or cooperative has jurisdiction over the unit, the corporation, council, or cooperative shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit from the homeowner for the amount specified in a firm contract between the homeowner and a prospective buyer.
<br>(iii) Promissory note required
<br>
<br>The homeowner shall execute a promissory note equal to the difference, if any, between the market value and the purchase price, payable to the Secretary, together with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note.
<br>(B) 6 years or less
<br>
<br>In the case of a transfer within 6 years of the acquisition under the program, the homeownership program shall provide for appropriate restrictions to assure that an eligible family may not receive any undue profit. The plan shall provide for limiting the family's consideration for its interest in the property to the total of—
<br>
<br>(i) the contribution to equity paid by the family;
<br>
<br>(ii) the value, as determined by such means as the Secretary shall determine through regulation, of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family's tenure as owner; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the appreciated value determined by an inflation allowance at a rate which may be based on a cost-of-living index, an income index, or market index as determined by the Secretary through regulation and agreed to by the purchaser and the entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families (or another entity specified in the approved application), at the time of initial sale, and applied against the contribution to equity.
<br>
<br>Such an entity may, at the time of initial sale, enter into an agreement with the family to set a maximum amount which this appreciation may not exceed.
<br>(C) 6–20 years
<br>
<br>In the case of a transfer during the period beginning 6 years after the acquisition and ending 20 years after the acquisition, the homeownership program shall provide for the recapture by the Secretary or the program of an amount equal to the amount of the declining balance on the note described in subparagraph (A)(iii).
<br>(D) Use of recaptured funds
<br>
<br>Any net sales proceeds that may not be retained by the homeowner under the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the unit of general local government in which the housing is located. If the housing is located in a unit of general local government that is not a participating jurisdiction (as such term is defined in section 12704 of title 42), any such net sales proceeds shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the State in which the housing is located. With respect to any proceeds transferred to a HOME Investment Trust Fund under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the proceeds shall be immediately available for eligible activities to expand the supply of affordable housing under section 12742 of title 42. The Secretary shall require the maintenance of any records necessary to calculate accurately payments due under this paragraph.
<br>(6) Protection of nonpurchasing families
<br>(A) Eviction
<br>
<br>No tenant residing in a dwelling unit in a property on the date the Secretary approves a plan of action may be evicted by reason of a homeownership program approved under this subchapter.
<br>(B) Rental assistance
<br>
<br>If a tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the Secretary shall ensure that rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42 is available for use by each otherwise qualified tenant (that meets the eligibility requirements under such section) in that or another property. Any system for preferences established under section 1437f(d)(1)(A) or 1437f(o)(6)(A) of title 42 shall not apply to the provision of assistance to such families.
<br>(C) Relocation assistance
<br>
<br>The resident council shall also inform each such tenant that if the tenant chooses to move, the owner will pay relocation assistance in accordance with the approved homeownership program.
<br>(7) Qualified management
<br>
<br>As a condition of approval of a homeownership program under this subchapter, the resident council shall have demonstrated its abilities to manage eligible properties by having done so effectively and efficiently for a period of not less than 3 years or by entering into a contract with a qualified management entity that meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe to ensure that the property will be maintained in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.
<br>(8) Timely homeownership
<br>
<br>Except in the case of limited equity cooperatives, resident councils shall transfer ownership of the property to tenants within a specified period of time that the Secretary determines to be reasonable. During the interim period when the property continues to be operated and managed as rental housing, the resident council shall utilize written tenant selection policies and criteria that are approved by the Secretary as consistent with the purpose of providing housing for very low-income families. The resident council shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.
<br>(9) Records and audit of resident councils
<br>(A) Maintenance
<br>
<br>Each resident council shall keep such records as may be reasonably necessary to fully disclose the amount and the disposition by such resident council of the proceeds of assistance received under this subchapter (including any proceeds from sales under paragraphs (4) and (5)(D)), the total cost of the homeownership program in connection with which such assistance is given or used, and the amount and nature of that portion of the program supplied by other sources, and such other sources as will facilitate an effective audit.
<br>(B) Access
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the resident council that are pertinent to assistance received under this subchapter.
<br>(C) Audit
<br>
<br>The Comptroller General of the United States, or any of the duly authorized representatives of the Comptroller General, shall also have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the resident council that are pertinent to assistance received under this subchapter.
<br>(10) Assumption conditions
<br>
<br>Any entity that assumes a mortgage covering low-income housing in connection with the acquisition of the housing from an owner under this section must comply with any low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the housing as determined under section 4112(c) of this title.
