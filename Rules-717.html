<br>(a) Authority
<br>
<br>With respect to any Alaska natural gas transportation project, on a request by 1 or more persons and after giving notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Commission may order the expansion of the Alaska natural gas project if the Commission determines that such an expansion is required by the present and future public convenience and necessity.
<br>(b) Responsibilities of Commission
<br>
<br>Before ordering an expansion under subsection (a), the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(1) approve or establish rates for the expansion service that are designed to ensure the recovery, on an incremental or rolled-in basis, of the cost associated with the expansion (including a reasonable rate of return on investment);
<br>
<br>(2) ensure that the rates do not require existing shippers on the Alaska natural gas transportation project to subsidize expansion shippers;
<br>
<br>(3) find that a proposed shipper will comply with, and the proposed expansion and the expansion of service will be undertaken and implemented based on, terms and conditions consistent with the tariff of the Alaska natural gas transportation project in effect as of the date of the expansion;
<br>
<br>(4) find that the proposed facilities will not adversely affect the financial or economic viability of the Alaska natural gas transportation project;
<br>
<br>(5) find that the proposed facilities will not adversely affect the overall operations of the Alaska natural gas transportation project;
<br>
<br>(6) find that the proposed facilities will not diminish the contract rights of existing shippers to previously subscribed certificated capacity;
<br>
<br>(7) ensure that all necessary environmental reviews have been completed; and
<br>
<br>(8) find that adequate downstream facilities exist or are expected to exist to deliver incremental Alaska natural gas to market.
<br>(c) Requirement for a firm transportation agreement
<br>
<br>Any order of the Commission issued in accordance with this section shall be void unless the person requesting the order executes a firm transportation agreement with the Alaska natural gas transportation project within such reasonable period of time as the order may specify.
<br>(d) Limitation
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section expands or otherwise affects any authority of the Commission with respect to any natural gas pipeline located outside the State.

<br>§720l. Sense of Congress concerning natural gas demand
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) North American demand for natural gas will increase dramatically over the course of the next several decades;
<br>
<br>(2) both the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline and the Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas project in Canada will be necessary to help meet the increased demand for natural gas in North America;
<br>
<br>(3) Federal and State officials should work together with officials in Canada to ensure both projects can move forward in a mutually beneficial fashion;
<br>
<br>(4) Federal and State officials should acknowledge that the smaller scope, fewer permitting requirements, and lower cost of the Mackenzie Delta project means it will most likely be completed before the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline;
<br>
<br>(5) natural gas production in the 48 contiguous States and Canada will not be able to meet all domestic demand in the coming decades; and
<br>
<br>(6) as a result, natural gas delivered from Alaskan North Slope will not displace or reduce the commercial viability of Canadian natural gas produced from the Mackenzie Delta or production from the 48 contiguous States.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–324, div. C, §114, Oct. 13, 2004, 118 Stat. 1264.)
<br>§720m. Sense of Congress concerning Alaskan ownership
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) Alaska Native Regional Corporations, companies owned and operated by Alaskans, and individual Alaskans should have the opportunity to own shares of the Alaska natural gas pipeline in a way that promotes economic development for the State; and
<br>
<br>(2) to facilitate economic development in the State, all project sponsors should negotiate in good faith with any willing Alaskan person that desires to be involved in the project.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–324, div. C, §115, Oct. 13, 2004, 118 Stat. 1265.)

<br>
<br>(2) Subject to the requirements of this section, the Secretary may also enter into agreements with 1 or more owners of the Canadian portion of a qualified infrastructure project to issue Federal guarantee instruments with respect to loans and other debt obligations for a qualified infrastructure project as though such owner were a holder described in paragraph (1).

<br>(c) Limitations on amounts
<br>
<br>(1) The amount of loans and other debt obligations guaranteed under this section for a qualified infrastructure project shall not exceed 80 percent of the total capital costs of the project, including interest during construction.
<br>
<br>(2) The principal amount of loans and other debt obligations guaranteed under this section shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $18,000,000,000, which amount shall be indexed for United States dollar inflation from October 13, 2004, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, except that the total amount of principal that may be guaranteed for a qualified liquefied natural gas project may not exceed a principal amount in which the cost of loan guarantees, as defined by section 661a(5) of title 2, exceeds $2,000,000,000.
<br>(d) Loan terms and fees
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary may issue Federal guarantee instruments under this section that take into account repayment profiles and grace periods justified by project cash flows and project-specific considerations. The term of any loan guaranteed under this section shall not exceed 30 years.
<br>

<br>§761. Congressional declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Objectives
<br>
<br>The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and the common defense and security require positive and effective action to conserve scarce energy supplies, to insure fair and efficient distribution of, and the maintenance of fair and reasonable consumer prices for, such supplies, to promote the expansion of readily usable energy sources, and to assist in developing policies and plans to meet the energy needs of the Nation.
<br>(b) Necessity for reorganization
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that to help achieve these objectives, and to assure a coordinated and effective approach to overcoming energy shortages, it is necessary to reorganize certain agencies and functions of the executive branch and to establish a Federal Energy Administration.
<br>(c) Creation of Federal Energy Administration
<br>
<br>The sole purpose of this chapter is to create an administration in the executive branch, called the Federal Energy Administration, to vest in the Administration certain functions as provided in this chapter, and to transfer to such Administration certain executive branch functions authorized by other laws, where such transfer is necessary on an interim basis to deal with the Nation's energy shortages.
<br>
