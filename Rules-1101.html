<br>
<br>In the case of an outsourcing facility with gross annual sales of $1,000,000 or less in the 12 months ending April 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the fees under this section are assessed, the amount of the establishment fee under subsection (b) for a fiscal year shall be equal to \1/3\ of the amount calculated under paragraph (1)(A)(i) for such fiscal year.
<br>(B) Application
<br>
<br>To qualify for the exception under this paragraph, a small business shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such exception, in a format specified by the Secretary in guidance, certifying its gross annual sales for the 12 months ending April 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which fees under this subsection are assessed.

The sums transferred shall be available solely for the purpose of paying the costs of oversight of outsourcing facilities.
<br>(g) Collection of fees

Such a fee shall be collected after the Secretary has conducted a reinspection of the outsourcing facility involved.
<br>(3) Effect of failure to pay fees
<br>(A) Registration
<br>
<br>An outsourcing facility shall not be considered registered under section 353b(b) of this title in a fiscal year until the date that the outsourcing facility remits the establishment fee under this subsection for such fiscal year.
<br>(B) Misbranding
<br>
<br>All drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by an outsourcing facility for which any establishment fee or reinspection fee has not been paid, as required by this section, shall be deemed misbranded under section 352 of this title until the fees owed for such outsourcing facility under this section have been paid.
<br>(4) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under this section within 30 calendar days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to provisions of subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
