<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–171, §2, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1194, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the worst earthquake to affect Haiti in recorded history. Aftershocks from the earthquake, measuring up to 6.0 on the Richter scale, continued for days afterwards.
<br>
<br>"(2) The earthquake has devastated Haiti's infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, ports, communications, and other facilities. The loss of life attributable to the earthquake was massive.
<br>
<br>"(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 countries according to the United Nation's Human Development Index.
<br>
<br>"(4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic growth and development, including making strides towards establishing a competitive apparel sector.
<br>
<br>"(5) United States trade preference programs, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] (as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act [Pub. L. 106–200, title II, see Tables for classification], the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 [Pub. L. 109–432, div. D, title V, see Tables for classification], and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 [Pub. L. 110–234, title XV, subtitle D, part I, and Pub. L. 110–246, title XV, subtitle D, part I, see Tables for classification]), which extend duty-free tariff treatment to certain apparel produced in Haiti, have made an important contribution to Haiti's economic development efforts.
<br>
<br>"(6) However, the Haitian apparel sector has been hard hit by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. A number of apparel factories based in and around Port-au-Prince have been heavily damaged, including the collapse of one major apparel factory that had employed nearly 4,000 workers.
<br>
<br>"(7) The Port-au-Prince seaport that had served the apparel trade has been badly damaged. And extensive damage to roads has made it difficult to transport apparel to the Dominican Republic for shipment from ports in that country.
<br>
<br>"(8) According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, imports of apparel articles from Haiti to the United States in 2010 have decreased by 43 percent as compared to the same period in 2009.
<br>
<br>"(9) The earthquake has increased significantly the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Haiti. A strong and unequivocal commitment from the United States is needed to help Haiti offset these costs and preserve the gains made under United States trade preference programs, and to encourage buyers and investors to stand with Haiti through this crisis."
<br>Customs Support Services
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–171, §9, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1205, provided that:

<br>
<br>"(B) to provide immediate assistance, as warranted, particularly with respect to—
<br>
<br>"(i) reestablishing full capacity for commercial port operations at the seaport at Port-au-Prince;
<br>
<br>"(ii) facilitating trade between the United States and Haiti under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.], as amended by this Act;
<br>
<br>"(iii) preventing unlawful transshipment of goods through Haiti to the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(iv) otherwise strengthening cooperation between the customs authorities of the United States, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic with respect to trade facilitation and economic development, customs compliance and law enforcement, and efforts to combat unlawful trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
<br>
<br>"(2) Report.—Not later than 75 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [May 24, 2010], the Commissioner shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives a nonconfidential report summarizing the results of the assessment required by paragraph (1)(A), including—
<br>
<br>"(A) a description of the short-term and long-term technical, capacity-building, and training needs of the authorities of the Government of Haiti responsible for customs services, including a prioritization of immediate infrastructure needs;
<br>
<br>"(B) a multi-year plan for supplying technical, capacity-building, and training assistance to those authorities, including specific responsibilities to be undertaken by the support team authorized by subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>"(C) a statement of the amount and purpose for which any funds were expended by the rapid response team in Haiti to administer the provisions of this section, including any expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated pursuant to subsection (c)(1).

<br>"(b) Support Team.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—The Commissioner shall, in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate, seek to establish a support team in Haiti for the purpose of helping to meet the short-term and long-term technical, capacity-building, and training needs of the authorities of the Government of Haiti responsible for customs services, as described in this section.
<br>
<br>"(2) Termination.—The support team authorized by paragraph (1) shall terminate on September 30, 2020.
<br>
<br>"(c) Authorization of Appropriations.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency, to remain available until expended—
<br>
<br>"(A) $100,000 to help meet the immediate infrastructure needs of the authorities of the Government of Haiti responsible for customs services for the purpose of facilitating trade between the United States and Haiti under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.], as amended by this Act; and
<br>
<br>"(B) $750,000 for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2020 for the purpose of maintaining the support team authorized by subsection (b).
<br>
<br>"(2) Supplement and not supplant.—The amounts authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1) shall supplement and not supplant any other funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Homeland Security."

<br>§2801. Congressional findings and purposes
<br>
<br>(a) Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) there is a substantial imbalance in international wine trade resulting, in part, from the relative accessibility enjoyed by foreign wines to the United States market while the United States wine industry faces restrictive tariff and nontariff barriers in virtually every existing or potential foreign market;
<br>
<br>(2) the restricted access to foreign markets and the continued low prices for United States wine and grape products adversely affect the economic position of our Nation's winemakers and grape growers, as well as all other domestic sectors that depend upon wine production;
<br>
<br>(3) the competitive position of United States wine in international trade has been weakened by foreign trade practices, high domestic interest rates, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates;
<br>
<br>(4) wine consumption per capita is very low in many major non-wine producing markets and the demand potential for United States wine is significant; and
<br>
<br>(5) the United States winemaking industry has the capacity and the ability to export substantial volumes of wine and an increase in United States wine exports will create new jobs, improve this Nation's balance of trade, and otherwise strengthen the national economy.
<br>
<br>(b) The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to provide wine consumers with the greatest possible choice of wines from wine-producing countries;
<br>
<br>(2) to encourage the initiation of an export promotion program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for United States wine; and
<br>
<br>(3) to achieve greater access to foreign markets for United States wine and grape products through the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers and nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in wine.

<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding the improvement of GATT and multilateral trade negotiation agreements are—
<br>
<br>(A) to enhance the status of the GATT;
<br>
<br>(B) to improve the operation and extend the coverage of the GATT and such agreements and arrangements to products, sectors, and conditions of trade not adequately covered; and
<br>
<br>(C) to expand country participation in particular agreements or arrangements, where appropriate.
<br>(3) Transparency
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding transparency is to obtain broader application of the principle of transparency and clarification of the costs and benefits of trade policy actions through the observance of open and equitable procedures in trade matters by Contracting Parties to the GATT.
<br>(4) Developing countries
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding developing countries are—
<br>
<br>(A) to ensure that developing countries promote economic development by assuming the fullest possible measure of responsibility for achieving and maintaining an open international trading system by providing reciprocal benefits and assuming equivalent obligations with respect to their import and export practices; and
<br>
<br>(B) to establish procedures for reducing nonreciprocal trade benefits for the more advanced developing countries.
<br>(5) Current account surpluses
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding current account surpluses is to develop rules to address large and persistent global current account imbalances of countries, including imbalances which threaten the stability of the international trading system, by imposing greater responsibility on such countries to undertake policy changes aimed at restoring current account equilibrium, including expedited implementation of trade agreements where feasible and appropriate.
<br>(6) Trade and monetary coordination
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding trade and monetary coordination is to develop mechanisms to assure greater coordination, consistency, and cooperation between international trade and monetary systems and institutions.
<br>(7) Agriculture
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to agriculture are to achieve, on an expedited basis to the maximum extent feasible, more open and fair conditions of trade in agricultural commodities by—

<br>(B) increasing United States agricultural exports by eliminating barriers to trade (including transparent and nontransparent barriers) and reducing or eliminating the subsidization of agricultural production consistent with the United States policy of agricultural stabilization in cyclical and unpredictable markets;
<br>
<br>(C) creating a free and more open world agricultural trading system by resolving questions pertaining to export and other trade-distorting subsidies, market pricing and market access and eliminating and reducing substantially other specific constraints to fair trade and more open market access, such as tariffs, quotas, and other nontariff practices, including unjustified phytosanitary and sanitary restrictions; and
<br>
<br>(D) seeking agreements by which the major agricultural exporting nations agree to pursue policies to reduce excessive production of agricultural commodities during periods of oversupply, with due regard for the fact that the United States already undertakes such policies, and without recourse to arbitrary schemes to divide market shares among major exporting countries.
<br>(8) Unfair trade practices
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to unfair trade practices are—
<br>
<br>(A) to improve the provisions of the GATT and nontariff measure agreements in order to define, deter, discourage the persistent use of, and otherwise discipline unfair trade practices having adverse trade effects, including forms of subsidy and dumping and other practices not adequately covered such as resource input subsidies, diversionary dumping, dumped or subsidized inputs, and export targeting practices;
<br>
<br>(B) to obtain the application of similar rules to the treatment of primary and nonprimary products in the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of the GATT (relating to subsidies and countervailing measures); and
<br>
<br>(C) to obtain the enforcement of GATT rules against—
<br>
<br>(i) state trading enterprises, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the acts, practices, or policies of any foreign government which, as a practical matter, unreasonably require that—
<br>
<br>(I) substantial direct investment in the foreign country be made,
<br>
<br>(II) intellectual property be licensed to the foreign country or to any firm of the foreign country, or
<br>
<br>(III) other collateral concessions be made,
<br>
<br> as a condition for the importation of any product or service of the United States into the foreign country or as a condition for carrying on business in the foreign country.
<br>(9) Trade in services
<br>
<br>(A) The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade in services are—
<br>
<br>(i) to reduce or to eliminate barriers to, or other distortions of, international trade in services, including barriers that deny national treatment and restrictions on establishment and operation in such markets; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to develop internationally agreed rules, including dispute settlement procedures, which—
<br>
<br>(I) are consistent with the commercial policies of the United States, and
<br>

<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) in the last 10 years there has arisen a new global economy in which trade, technological development, investment, and services form an integrated system; and in this system these activities affect each other and the health of the United States economy;
<br>
<br>"(2) the United States is confronted with a fundamental disequilibrium in its trade and current account balances and a rapid increase in its net external debt;
<br>
<br>"(3) such disequilibrium and increase are a result of numerous factors, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) disparities between the macroeconomic policies of the major trading nations,
<br>
<br>"(B) the large United States budget deficit,
<br>
<br>"(C) instabilities and structural defects in the world monetary system,

<br>"(G) serious shortcomings in United States trade policy, and
<br>
<br>"(H) inadequate growth in the productivity and competitiveness of United States firms and industries relative to their overseas competition;

<br>"(A) to prevent future declines in the United States economy and standards of living,
<br>
<br>"(B) to ensure future stability in external trade of the United States, and
<br>
<br>"(C) to guarantee the continued vitality of the technological, industrial, and agricultural base of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(5) the President should be authorized and encouraged to negotiate trade agreements and related investment, financial, intellectual property, and services agreements that meet the standards set forth in this title [see Tables for classification]; and
<br>
<br>"(6) while the United States is not in a position to dictate economic policy to the rest of the world, the United States is in a position to lead the world and it is in the national interest for the United States to do so.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Tables for classification] are to—
<br>
<br>"(1) authorize the negotiation of reciprocal trade agreements;
<br>
<br>"(2) strengthen United States trade laws;
<br>
<br>"(3) improve the development and management of United States trade strategy; and
<br>
<br>"(4) through these actions, improve standards of living in the world."

<br>
<br>(A) before June 1, 1993, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries; and
<br>
<br>(B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), proclaim—
<br>
<br>(i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
<br>
<br>(ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or
<br>
<br>(iii) such additional duties;
<br>
<br>as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) No proclamation may be made under subsection (a) that—
<br>
<br>(A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on August 23, 1988) to a rate which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on August 23, 1988; or
<br>
<br>(B) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applies on August 23, 1988.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed in paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article.
<br>
<br>(B) No staging under subparagraph (A) is required with respect to a rate reduction that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that is not produced in the United States. The United States International Trade Commission shall advise the President of the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(4) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (3), the President may round an annual reduction by the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
<br>
<br>(B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
<br>
<br>(5) No reduction in a rate of duty under a trade agreement entered into under subsection (a) on any article may take effect more than 10 years after the effective date of the first reduction under paragraph (1) that is proclaimed to carry out the trade agreement with respect to such article.
<br>
<br>(6) A rate of duty reduction or increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction or increase is included within an implementing bill provided for under section 2903 of this title and that bill is enacted into law.
<br>(b) Agreements regarding nontariff barriers
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the President determines that any barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade—
<br>
<br>(A) unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy; or
<br>
<br>(B) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect;
<br>
<br>and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this title will be promoted thereby, the President may, before June 1, 1993, enter into a trade agreement with foreign countries providing for—
<br>
<br>(i) the reduction or elimination of such barrier or other distortion; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the prohibition of, or limitations on the imposition of, such barrier or other distortion.
<br>
<br>(2) A trade agreement may be entered into under this subsection only if such agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives described in section 2901 of this title.

<br>
<br>(1) Before June 1, 1993, the President may enter into bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.
