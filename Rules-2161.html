<br>Proc. No. 6726. Placing Into Full Force and Effect Compact of Free Association With Republic of Palau
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 6726, Sept. 27, 1994, 59 F.R. 49777, provided:
<br>
<br>Since July 18, 1947, the United States has administered the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ("Trust Territory"), which has included the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.
<br>
<br>On November 3, 1986, a Covenant between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands [48 U.S.C. 1801 note] came into force. This Covenant established the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as a self-governing Commonwealth in political union with and under the sovereignty of the United States.
<br>
<br>On October 21, 1986, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and on November 3, 1986, in the case of the Federated States of Micronesia, Compacts of Free Association with the United States [48 U.S.C. 1901 note] became effective. Under the Compacts, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands became self-governing sovereign states, in free association with the United States. Following the changes in political status of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Trusteeship Agreement ceased to be applicable to those entities and only Palau remained as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
<br>
<br>On January 10, 1986, the Government of the United States and the Government of Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association [set out above] similar to those that the United States entered into with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and with the Federated States of Micronesia. As in those instances, it was specified that the Compact with Palau would come into effect upon (1) mutual agreement between the Government of the United States, acting in fulfillment of its responsibilities as Administering Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Government of Palau; (2) the approval of the Compact by the two Governments, in accordance with their constitutional processes; and (3) the approval of the Compact by plebiscite in Palau.
<br>
<br>In Palau the Compact has been approved by the Government in accordance with its constitutional processes and by a United Nations-observed plebiscite on November 9, 1993, a sovereign act of self-determination. In the United States the Compact was approved by Public Law 99–658 of November 14, 1986 [48 U.S.C. 1931 et seq.], and Public Law 101–219 of December 12, 1989 [48 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.].
<br>
<br>On May 25, 1994, the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations concluded that the Government of the United States had satisfactorily discharged its obligations as the Administering Authority under the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the people of Palau had freely exercised their right to self-determination and considered that it was appropriate for the Trusteeship Agreement to be terminated. The Council asked the United States to consult with the Government of Palau and to agree on a date, on or about October 1, 1994, for entry into force of their new status agreement.
<br>
<br>On July 15, 1994, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Palau agreed, pursuant to section 411 of the Compact of Free Association, that as between the United States and the Republic of Palau, the effective date of the Compact shall be October 1, 1994.
<br>
<br>As of this day, September 27, 1994, the United States has fulfilled its obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement with respect to the Republic of Palau. On October 1, 1994, the Compact will enter into force between the United States and the Republic of Palau, and Palau will thereafter be self-governing and no longer subject to the Trusteeship. In taking these actions, the United States is implementing the freely expressed wishes of the people of Palau.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including sections 101 and 102 of the Joint Resolution to approve the "Compact of Free Association" between the United States and the Government of Palau, and for other purposes, approved on November 14, 1986 (Public Law 99–658) [48 U.S.C. 1931, 1932], and section 101 of the Joint Resolution to authorize entry into force of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Government of Palau, and for other purposes, approved on December 12, 1989 (Public Law 101–219) [48 U.S.C. 1951], and pursuant to section 1002 of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America [48 U.S.C. 1801 note], and consistent with sections 101 and 102 of the Joint Resolution to approve the "Compact of Free Association" and for other purposes, approved on January 14, 1986 (Public Law 99–239) [48 U.S.C. 1901, 1902], do hereby find, declare, and proclaim as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. I determine that the Trusteeship Agreement for the Pacific Islands will be no longer in effect with respect to the Republic of Palau as of October 1, 1994, at one minute past one o'clock p.m. local time in Palau. This constitutes the determination referred to in section 1002 of the Covenant with the Northern Mariana Islands (Public Law 94–241).
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. The Compact of Free Association with the Republic of Palau will be in full force and effect as of October 1, 1994, at one minute past one o'clock p.m. local time in Palau.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. I am gratified that the people of the Republic of Palau, after 47 years of Trusteeship, have freely chosen to establish a relationship of Free Association with the United States.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.
<br>
<br>William J. Clinton.

The Government of Palau may use the amount of $250,000 annually from current account funds provided pursuant to section 211 of the Compact to defray expenditures attendant to the operation of the Civic Action Teams made available pursuant to this subsection. The Government of the Marshall Islands may use the amount of $250,000 annually from current account funds provided under section 211 of Title Two of the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands to defray expenditures attendant to the operation of the Civic Action Teams made available pursuant to this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) For expenditures that the Department of Defense makes pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense may accept up to the amount of $250,000 in annual funds from the Government of Palau as specified in paragraph (1).

<br>(b) Inventory and study of natural, historic, and other resources
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct, upon request of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, and through the Director of the National Park Service, a comprehensive inventory and study of the most unique and significant natural, historical, cultural, and recreational resources of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands. Areas or sites exhibiting such qualities shall be described and evaluated with the objective of the preservation of their values and their careful use and appreciation by the public, along with a determination of their potential for attracting tourism. Alternative methodologies for such preservation and use shall be developed for each area or site (including continued assistance from the National Park Service); current or impending damage or threats to the resources of such areas or sites shall be identified and evaluated; and authorities needed to properly protect and allow for public use and appreciation shall be identified and discussed. Such inventory and study shall be conducted in full cooperation and consultation with affected governmental officials and the interested public.

The inventory and study shall also identify areas or sites which, if they were located in the United States, would qualify to be listed on the Registry of Natural Landmarks and the National Register of Historic Places.
<br>(c) Omitted
<br>(d) Peleliu and Angaur
<br>
<br>Not later than one year after November 14, 1986, the Secretary of Agriculture, after appropriate studies conducted in consultation with the Government of Palau, shall report to the President and the Congress concerning the feasibility and cost of rehabilitating and restoring the fertility of the topsoil of the islands of Peleliu and Angaur. Upon the request of the Government of Palau, the President shall make the report of the Secretary of Agriculture available to the Government of Palau. Technical assistance to accomplish such rehabilitation and restoration, if feasible, may be provided to the Government of Palau on a nonreimbursable basis, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
<br>(e) Power generation
<br>
<br>Neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor any other officer or agent of the United States shall pay or transfer any portion of the sum and amounts payable to the Government of Palau pursuant to this joint resolution to any party other than the Government of Palau, except under the procedures established by the Compact and its related agreements. No funds appropriated pursuant to the Compact, this Act, or any other Act for grants or other assistance to Palau may be used to satisfy any obligation or expense incurred by Palau prior to November 14, 1986, with respect to any contract or debt related to any electrical generating plant or related facilities entered into or incurred by Palau which has not been specifically authorized by Congress in advance, except that the Government of Palau may use any portion of the annual grant under section 211(b) 1 not required to be devoted to the energy needs of those parts of Palau not served by its central power generating facilities and any portion of the funds under section 212(b) of the Compact for such purpose.
<br>(f) Reduction of appropriations

<br>(g) Understandings, interpretations, and policy statements
<br>
<br>The Congress reaffirms all of the understandings, interpretations, and policy statements contained in Public Law 99–239 (99 Stat. 1770) [48 U.S.C. 1901 et seq., 2001 et seq.]. Congressional Resolution 4–60 adopted by the 4th Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia on March 26, 1986 and Resolution No. 62 adopted by the Nitijela of the Marshall Islands on February 18, 1986 do not exclude, limit or modify any provision of the Compact of Free Association as approved by the United States. To the extent that any understandings, interpretations, and policy statements contained in such Resolutions are inconsistent with the provisions of Public Law 99–239, the United States does not concur therein. The President shall take such steps, including but not limited to, communicating with the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as may be necessary to preserve all rights of the United States in connection with interpretation and implementation of such Public Law.
<br>(h) Additional provisions relating to Title Three of Compact
<br>
<br>(1) The Government of the United States recognizes and respects the scarcity and special importance of land in Palau. In making any designation of land pursuant to section 322 of the Compact, the Government of the United States shall follow the policy of requesting the minimum area necessary to accomplish the required security and defense purpose, of requesting only the minimum interest in real property necessary to support such purpose, and of requesting first to satisfy the requirement through public real property, where available, rather than through private real property.
<br>
<br>(2) The Armed Forces of other nations invited to use military areas and facilities in Palau pursuant to section 312 of the Compact shall be permitted only as it is incident to the authority and under the control of the United States. The activities of such third country forces shall be subject to the same limitations and restrictions applicable to the authority of the United States under the terms of the Compact.
<br>
<br>(3) The Government of the United States considers "Exclusive use" areas established for the United States pursuant to Title Three of the Compact to be "within the jurisdiction of Palau," as that term is used in section 324 of the Compact.
<br>(i) Availability of appropriations
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds appropriated for the Compact of Free Association, Public Law 99–239 [48 U.S.C. 1901 et seq., 2001 et seq.], or this joint resolution, in the act of making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1986, shall remain available until expended.
<br>(j) Authority to contract or make payments
<br>
<br>(1), (2) Omitted
<br>
<br>(3) No authority under this subsection to enter into contracts or to make payments shall be effective except to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Any provision of this subsection which authorizes the enactment of new budget authority shall be effective only for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1985.
<br>(k) Annual report
<br>
<br>The Departments of Energy and Interior are directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate with a report by December 1 of each fiscal year detailing how funds were spent during the previous fiscal year for the special medical care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and for the agriculture and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini as referenced in Section 103(h) of Public Law 99–239 [48 U.S.C. 1903(h)]. The report shall also specify the anticipated needs during the current and following fiscal years in order to meet the radiological health care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and the planting, agricultural maintenance, and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini. It is the sense of the Congress that the special medical care and logistical support program for Rongelap and Utrik and for the agriculture and food programs for Eniwetok and Bikini described in section 103(h) of Public Law 99–239 represent special and continuing moral commitments of the United States which will be annually funded to the extent of the need of the populations of such atolls for such assistance.
