<br>(b) Consent to deduction; discharge and acquittance of claims and demands
<br>
<br>Each participant shall be deemed to consent and agree to such deductions from basic salary.

Each such member shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the other Government retirement fund on account of service rendered by such member prior to becoming a participant in the System.
<br>
<br>(2) A member of the Service whose contributions are transferred to the Fund pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be required to make additional contributions for periods of service for which required contributions were made to the other Government retirement fund; nor shall any refund be made to any such member on account of contributions made during any period to the other Government retirement fund at a higher rate than that fixed by subsection (d).

The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the participant may provide or if the Secretary determines sufficient evidence has not been so provided to adequately determine basic pay for military or naval service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the Department under paragraph (4).

<br>(a) 1 Measurements; reduction for special contributions; Foreign Service investigator/inspectors
<br>
<br>(1) The annuity of a participant shall be equal to 2 percent of his or her average basic salary for the highest 3 consecutive years of service multiplied by the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit obtained in accordance with sections 4056 and 4057 of this title, except that the highest 3 years of service shall be used in computing the annuity of any participant who serves an assignment in a position, as described in section 3942(b) of this title, to which the participant was appointed by the President and whose continuity of service in that position is interrupted prior to retirement by appointment or assignment to any other position determined by the Secretary of State to be of comparable importance. In determining the aggregate period of service upon which the annuity is to be based, the fractional part of a month, if any, shall not be counted. The annuity shall be reduced by 10 percent of any special contribution described in section 4045(d) of this title which is due for service for which no contributions were made and which remains unpaid unless the participant elects to eliminate the service involved for purposes of annuity computation.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding the percentage limitation contained in paragraph (1) of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) utilizing the definition of average pay contained in section 8331(4) of title 5, the annuity of a Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector of the Office of the Inspector General, Agency for International Development, who was appointed to a law enforcement position, as defined in section 8331(20) of title 5, prior to January 1, 1984, and would have been eligible to retire pursuant to section 8336(c) of that title, after attaining 50 years of age and completing 20 years as a law enforcement officer had the employee remained in the civil service shall be computed in the same manner as that of a law enforcement officer pursuant to section 8339(d) of that title, except as provided in paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(B) the annuity of a Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector of such office, who was appointed to a law enforcement position as defined in section 8401(17) of that title on or after January 1, 1984, and who would have been eligible to retire pursuant to section 8412(d) of that title, after attaining 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as such a law enforcement officer, had the employee remained in the civil service, shall be computed in the same manner as that of a law enforcement officer pursuant to section 8415(e) of that title.
<br>
<br>(3) The annuity of a Foreign Service investigator/inspector of the Office of the Inspector General, Agency for International Development, appointed to a law enforcement position prior to January 1, 1984, who exercised election rights under section 4071i of this title, shall be computed as follows: for the period prior to election the annuity shall be computed in accordance with section 8339(d) of title 5; for the period following election the annuity shall be computed in accordance with section 8415(e) of that title.
<br>
<br>(4) All service in a law enforcement position, as defined in section 8331(20) or 8401(17) of that title, as applicable, in any agency or combination of agencies shall be included in the computation of time for purposes of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(5) The annuity of a Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector of the Office of the Inspector General of the Agency for International Development who has not completed 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer, as defined in section 8331(20) or 8401(17) of that title, shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The annuity of a special agent under this part shall be computed under paragraph (1) except that, in the case of a special agent described in subparagraph (B), paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting for "2 percent"—
<br>
<br>(i) the percentage under subparagraph (A) of section 8339(d)(1) of title 5 for so much of the participant's total service as is specified thereunder; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the percentage under subparagraph (B) of section 8339(d)(1) of title 5 for so much of the participant's total service as is specified thereunder.
<br>
<br>(B) A special agent described in this subparagraph is any such agent or former agent who—
<br>
<br>(i)(I) retires voluntarily or involuntarily under section 4007, 4008, 4010a, 4051, 4052, or 4053 of this title, under conditions authorizing an immediate annuity, other than for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency, or retires for disability under section 4048 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(II) at the time of retirement—
<br>
<br>(aa) if voluntary, is at least 50 years of age and has completed at least 20 years of service as a special agent; or
<br>
<br>(bb) if involuntary or disability, has completed at least 20 years of service as a special agent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) dies in service after completing at least 20 years of service as a special agent, when an annuity is payable under section 4049 of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), included with the years of service performed by an individual as a special agent shall be any service performed by such individual as a law enforcement officer (within the meaning of section 8331(20) or section 8401(17) of title 5), or a member of the Capitol Police.
<br>
<br>(7) In the case of a special agent who becomes or became subject to part II—
<br>
<br>(A) for purposes of paragraph (6)(B), any service performed by the individual as a special agent (whether under this part or under part II), as a law enforcement officer (within the meaning of section 8331(20) or section 8401(17) of title 5), or as a member of the Capitol Police shall be creditable; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the individual satisfies paragraph (6)(B), the portion of such individual's annuity which is attributable to service under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System or the Civil Service Retirement System shall be computed in conformance with paragraph (6).
<br>
<br>(8) For purposes of paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this subsection, the term "basic pay" includes pay as provided in accordance with section 3972 of this title or section 5545(c)(2) of title 5.
<br>
<br>(9) For purposes of any annuity computation under this subsection, the basic salary or basic pay of any member of the Service whose official duty station is outside the continental United States shall be considered to be the salary or pay that would have been paid to the member had the member's official duty station been Washington, D.C., including locality-based comparability payments under section 5304 of title 5 that would have been payable to the member if the member's official duty station had been Washington, D.C.
<br>(b) Married participants
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 60), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for his or her spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 4054(b) of this title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(B) At the time of retirement, a married participant or former participant and his or her spouse may jointly elect in writing to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section (or under section 4054(b) of this title if the spouse later qualifies as a former spouse under section 4044(6) of this title), or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section (or section 4054(b) of this title) by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor benefit. In the event the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 4054(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(C) If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, the participant and such former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 4060(b)(1) of this title to waive a survivor annuity under section 4054(b) of this title for that former spouse if the election is made (i) before the end of the 24-month period after the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final or (ii) at the time of retirement, whichever occurs first.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary of State may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.
<br>
<br>(2) The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor benefit under this section (or section 4054(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 2½ percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 4054(a)(5) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If a former participant entitled to receive a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a), or 55 percent of any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor benefit under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor benefits which remains available under section 4054(b)(4)(B) of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.
<br>(c) Surviving children
<br>
<br>(1) If an annuitant who was a participant dies and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant and by a child or children, in addition to the annuity payable to the surviving spouse, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each child an annuity equal to the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(A) $900, or
<br>
<br>(B) $2,700 divided by the number of children.
<br>
<br>(2) If an annuitant who was a participant dies and is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(A) $1,080, or
<br>
<br>(B) $3,240 divided by the number of children.
<br>
<br>(3) The amounts specified in this subsection are subject to—
<br>
<br>(A) cost-of-living adjustments as specified under section 4066(c)(3) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) the minimum specified in subsection (l)(2) of this section.
<br>(d) Recomputation for remaining children
<br>
<br>On the death of the surviving spouse or former spouse or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the spouse, former spouse, or child had not survived the participant. If the annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed, the annuities of any other children shall be recomputed and paid from that date as though the annuities to all currently eligible children in the family were then being initiated.
<br>(e) Payment period for child
<br>
<br>The annuity payable to a child under subsection (c) or (d) shall begin on the day after the participant dies, or if the child is not then qualified, on the first day of the month in which the child becomes eligible. The annuity of a child shall terminate on the last day of the month which precedes the month in which eligibility ceases.
<br>(f) Unmarried participants
<br>
<br>At the time of retirement an unmarried participant who does not have a former spouse for whose benefit a reduction is made under subsection (b) may elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide for an annuity equal to 55 percent of the reduced annuity payable after his or her death to a beneficiary whose name is designated in writing to the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a participant making such election shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under subsection (a) and by 5 percent of an annuity so computed for each full 5 years the designated beneficiary is younger than the retiring participant, but such total reduction shall not exceed 40 percent. No such election of a reduced annuity payable to a beneficiary shall be valid until the participant has satisfactorily passed a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a beneficiary under this subsection shall begin on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month preceding the death of the beneficiary. An annuity which is reduced under this subsection (or any similar prior provision of law) shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the beneficiary named under this subsection, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced.
<br>(g) Marriage after retirement
<br>
<br>A participant or former participant who was unmarried at retirement and who later marries may, within one year after such marriage, irrevocably elect in writing to receive a reduced annuity and to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse (if such spouse qualifies as a surviving spouse under section 4044(13) of this title). Receipt by the Secretary of State of notice of an election under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made under subsection (f). The reduction in annuity required by an election under this subsection shall be computed and the amount of the survivor annuity shall be determined in accordance with subsections (b)(2) and (3). The annuity reduction or recomputation shall be effective the first day of the month beginning one year after the date of marriage.
<br>(h) Election of benefits
<br>
<br>A surviving spouse or surviving former spouse of any participant or former participant shall not become entitled to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the Fund under this part unless the survivor elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which he or she may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than that participant.
<br>(i) Reversion to retired status
<br>
<br>(1) Any married annuitant who reverts to retired status with entitlement to a supplemental annuity under section 4063 of this title shall, unless the annuitant and his or her spouse jointly elect in writing to the contrary at that time, have the supplemental annuity reduced by 10 percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for his or her spouse. Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant and shall be payable to a surviving spouse to whom the annuitant was married at the time of reversion to retired status or whom the annuitant subsequently married.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of State shall issue regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of section 4063 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under this part.
<br>(j) Recomputation upon dissolution of marriage; election after remarriage
<br>
<br>An annuity which is reduced under this section or any similar prior provision of law to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which an annuitant is not married (or is remarried if there is no election in effect under the following sentence) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor benefit under section 4054(b) or (c) of this title. Upon remarriage the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Secretary within one year after such remarriage, to receive during such marriage a reduction in annuity for the purpose of allowing an annuity for the new spouse of the annuitant in the event such spouse survives the annuitant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 4054(b)(5) of this title), and shall be effective the first day of the first month beginning one year after the date of remarriage. A survivor annuity elected under this subsection shall be treated in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b).
<br>(k) Informing of rights by Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State shall, on an annual basis—
<br>
<br>(1) inform each participant of his or her right of election under subsections (g) and (j); and
<br>
<br>(2) to the maximum extent practicable, inform spouses or former spouses of participants or former participants of their rights under this section and section 4054 of this title.
<br>(l) Repealed. Pub. L. 100–238, title II, §217(c)(1), Jan. 8, 1988, 101 Stat. 1775
<br>(m) Offset of Social Security benefits
<br>
<br>The retirement, disability, or survivor annuity payable to any person based on the service of an individual subject to section 4045(h) of this title beginning with the first day of the month for which such person first becomes—
<br>
<br>(1) eligible for an annuity under this part based on the service of such individual, and
<br>
<br>(2) entitled, or would, upon proper application, be entitled to old age, disability, or survivor benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], based on the service of such individual under this part,
<br>
<br>shall be computed as if section 8349 of title 5 were applicable.
<br>(n) 18-month period to elect survivor annuity
<br>
<br>(1)(A) A participant—
<br>
<br>(i) who, at the time of retirement, is married; and
<br>
<br>(ii) who elects at such time (in accordance with subsection (b)) to waive a survivor annuity,
<br>
<br>may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a reduction under subsection (b) made in the annuity of the participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse of such participant.
<br>
<br>(B) A participant—
<br>
<br>(i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and
<br>
<br>(ii) who at such time designates (in accordance with subsection (b)) that a limited portion of the annuity of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity,
<br>
<br>may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such participant so used.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) An election under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be considered effective unless the amount specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the applicable 18-month period under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(B) The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the additional cost to the System which is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section and results from such election taking into account (I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such former participant under this part and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity, and (II) the costs associated with providing the later election; and
<br>
<br>(ii) interest on the additional cost determined under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph computed using the interest rate specified or determined under section 4045(d)(3) of this title for the calendar year in which the amount to be deposited is determined.
<br>
<br>(3) An election by a participant under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such participant under subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(4) An annuity which is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the participant whose annuity is so reduced.
<br>
<br>(5) Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retiring.

<br>§4047. Payment of annuity
<br>(a) Commencement of annuity
<br>
<br>(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), the annuity of a participant who has met the eligibility requirements for an annuity shall commence on the first day of the month after—
<br>
<br>(A) separation from the Service occurs; or
<br>
<br>(B) pay ceases and the service and age requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.
<br>
<br>(2) The annuity of—
<br>
<br>(A) a participant who is retired and is eligible for benefits under section 4009(a) of this title or a participant who is retired under section 4053 of this title or is otherwise involuntarily separated from the Service, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency,
<br>
<br>(B) a participant retiring under section 4048 of this title due to a disability, and
<br>
<br>(C) a participant who serves 3 days or less in the month of retirement—
<br>
<br>shall commence on the day after separation from the Service or the day after pay ceases and the requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.
<br>(b) Survivor's annuity; application; proof of eligibility; payment to estate
<br>
<br>The annuity to a survivor shall become effective as otherwise specified but shall not be paid until the survivor submits an application for such annuity, supported by such proof of eligibility as the Secretary of State may require. If such application or proof of eligibility is not submitted during the lifetime of an otherwise eligible individual, no annuity shall be due or payable to his or her estate.
<br>(c) Waiver
<br>
<br>An individual entitled to annuity from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by submitting a signed waiver to the Secretary of State. The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time. Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the period during which the waiver was in effect.
<br>(d) Recovery of overpayment
<br>
<br>Recovery of overpayments under this part may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Secretary of State, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience or administratively infeasible.
<br>(e) Alternate forms of annuities
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary of State shall prescribe regulations under which any participant who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this part (other than under section 4048 of this title), elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this part (including survivor benefits) based on the service of the participant.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary of State shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Secretary considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) an alternative which provides for—
<br>
<br>(i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and
<br>
<br>(ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life; and
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a participant who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for—
<br>
<br>(i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and
<br>
<br>(ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.
<br>
<br>(3) Each alternative provided for under paragraph (2) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the total value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the participant under this part, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(4) A participant who, at the time of retiring under this part—
<br>
<br>(A) is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 4046(b)(1)(B) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under this part (based on the service of the participant) unless a waiver has been made under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) A participant who is married at the time of retiring under this part and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 4046(n) of this title, subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.
<br>
<br>(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lump-sum credit provided pursuant to an election under this subsection shall not preclude an individual from receiving any other benefits under this subsection.

<br>(a) Causes; service credit
<br>
<br>Any participant who has at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service) and who becomes totally disabled or incapacitated for useful and efficient service by reason of disease, illness, or injury (not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful conduct of the participant) shall, upon his or her own application or upon order of the Secretary, be retired on an annuity computed as prescribed in section 4046 of this title. If the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System at the time of retirement, his or her annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this sentence shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age at the time of retirement and age 60.
<br>
<br>However, if a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of title 5) or Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under this part excluding extra credit authorized by this subsection and excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532 1 of title 5 or the Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired pay or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this part in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity computed under this part.
<br>(b) Physical examination; reinstatement or reappointment upon recovery; fees and expenses; duration and suspension of annuity
<br>
<br>Before being retired under this section, the participant shall be given a physical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Secretary of State to conduct examinations. Disability or incapacity shall be determined by the Secretary of State on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons. Unless the disability or incapacity is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant has attained age 60. If the Secretary of State determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that he or she can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Service within 1 year from the date recovery is determined. Upon application, the Secretary shall reinstate such recovered annuitant in the class in which the annuitant was serving at time of retirement, or the Secretary may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present class of his or her contemporaries in the Service, appoint or recommend that the President appoint the annuitant to a higher class. Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date 6 months after the date of the examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Service, whichever is earlier. Fees for examinations under this section, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, shall be paid out of the Fund. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this subsection, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability or incapacity is satisfactorily established.
<br>(c) Benefits upon discontinuance of annuity
<br>
<br>If a recovered annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Service, he or she shall be considered to have been separated within the meaning of section 4050 of this title as of the date of retirement for disability or incapacity and shall, after the discontinuance of the annuity, be entitled to the benefits of that section or of section 4055 of this title, except that he or she may elect voluntary retirement if eligible under section 4051 of this title.
<br>(d) Election of benefits; concurrent benefits allowed
<br>
<br>No participant shall be entitled to receive an annuity under this part and compensation for injury or disability to himself or herself under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, covering the same period of time, except that a participant may simultaneously receive both an annuity under this section and scheduled disability payments under section 8107 of title 5. This subsection shall not bar the right of any claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this part or subchapter I of such chapter 8 2 for any part of the same period of time. Neither this subsection nor any provision of subchapter I of such chapter 8 2 shall be construed to deny the right of any participant to receive an annuity under this part and to receive concurrently any payment under subchapter I of such chapter 8 2 by reason of the death of any other individual.
<br>(e) Lump sum disability payments
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other law, the right of any individual entitled to an annuity under this part shall not be affected because such person has received an award of compensation in a lump sum under section 8135 of title 5, except that where such annuity is payable on account of the same disability for which compensation under such section has been paid, so much of such compensation as has been paid for any period extended beyond the date such annuity becomes effective, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department of Labor, to be paid into the Federal Employees' Compensation Fund. Before such individual receives such annuity, he or she shall—
<br>
<br>(1) refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing such commuted payments for such extended period, or
<br>
<br>(2) authorize the deduction of such amount from the annuity payable under this part, which amount shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to such Fund.
<br>
<br>Deductions from such annuity may be made from accrued and accruing payments, or may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary of Labor shall determine, whenever the Secretary of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of the annuitant warrant deferred refunding.
<br>(f) Time of filing application; waiver
<br>
<br>A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Secretary of State before the participant is separated from the Service or within one year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Secretary of State for a participant who at the date of separation from the Service or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Secretary of State within one year from the date of restoration of the participant to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.

<br>§4049. Death in service
<br>(a) Lump-sum credit
<br>
<br>If a participant dies and no claim for annuity is payable under this part, the lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with section 4055 of this title.
<br>(b) Surviving spouse
<br>
<br>If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or former spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title, such surviving spouse shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with subsections (e) and (g) of this section and section 4046(a) of this title and any surviving former spouse shall be entitled to an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title as if the participant died after being entitled to an annuity under this part.

<br>(c) Surviving spouse or former spouse, and children
<br>
<br>If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, and a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(1) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.
<br>(d) Surviving children
<br>
<br>If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is not survived by a spouse, or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(2) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.
<br>(e) Service credit; presumption of qualification
<br>
<br>If, at the time of his or her death, the participant had less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System, the annuity payable in accordance with subsection (b) shall be computed in accordance with section 4046 of this title on the assumption he or she has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a deceased participant under this subsection shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age on the date of death and age 60. In all cases arising under this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (d), or (g), it shall be assumed that the deceased participant was qualified for retirement on the date of death.
<br>(f) Recall service
<br>
<br>If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity dies in service after being recalled under section 3948 of this title and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with section 4063 of this title. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under section 4046(i) of this title as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his or her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under this subchapter, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under subsection (b) on the basis of the total service of the annuitant.
<br>(g) Limitation on surviving spouse's annuity
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b), if the participant or former participant had a former spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title, the annuity of the spouse under this section shall be subject to the limitation of section 4046(b)(3)(B) of this title.
<br>(h) Commencement, termination, and resumption of annuities
<br>

The Secretary shall withhold consent for retirement under this section by any participant who has not been a member of the Service for 5 years. Any participant who voluntarily separates from the Service before completing 5 years in the System and who, on the date of separation, would be eligible for an annuity, based on a voluntary separation, under section 8336 or 8338 of title 5, if the participant had been covered under the Civil Service Retirement System rather than subject to this subchapter while a member of the Service, may receive an annuity under section 8336 or 8338, notwithstanding section 8333(b) of title 5, if all contributions transferred to the Fund under section 4045(c)(1) of this title, as well as all contributions withheld from the participant's pay or contributed by the employer, and deposited into the Fund during the period he or she was subject to this subchapter, including interest on these amounts, are transferred to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund effective on the date the participant separates from the Service.

<br>shall be separated from the Service on the last day of the month in which such individual under subparagraph (A) or such Foreign Service criminal investigator/inspector under subparagraph (B) attains 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age.

The employing office shall notify the employee in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before that date. Action to separate the employee is not effective without the consent of the employee, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Any participant who is otherwise required to retire under subsection (a) while occupying a position to which he or she was appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, may continue to serve until that appointment is terminated.

<br>§4054. Former spouses
<br>(a) Living Service members
<br>
<br>(1) Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, a former spouse of a participant or former participant is entitled to an annuity if such former spouse was married to the participant for at least 10 years during service of the participant which is creditable under this subchapter with at least 5 of such years occurring while the participant was a member of the Foreign Service and—
<br>
<br>(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or
<br>
<br>(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent of such annuity.
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "creditable service" means service which is creditable under part I or II.
<br>
<br>(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.
<br>
<br>(3) The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the later of the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this part or the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final. The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on—
<br>
<br>(A) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or
<br>
<br>(B) the date the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).
<br>
<br>(4) No spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title involving any participant may provide for an annuity or any combination of annuities under this subsection which exceeds the annuity of the participant, nor may any such court order relating to an annuity under this subsection be given effect if it is issued more than 24 months after the date the divorce or annulment involved becomes final.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and in calculating any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) or section 4046(b)(3) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) If any annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 3948 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed in the Service in the case of a recovered disability annuitant or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under section 4064 of this title, the salary of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.
<br>
<br>(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant—
<br>
<br>(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify on the basis of his or her creditable service for an annuity under this part (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.
<br>
<br>(7) An annuity under this subsection shall be treated the same as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) for purposes of section 4046(h) of this title or any comparable provision of law.
<br>(b) Deceased Service members
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to any election under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, if a former participant who is entitled to receive an annuity is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled to a survivor annuity—
<br>
<br>(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse's pro rata share of 55 percent of the full amount of such annuity.
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "creditable service" means service which is creditable under part I or II.
<br>
<br>(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.
<br>
<br>(3) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this section (and section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to any participant or former participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as calculated under section 4046(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Once a survivor annuity has been provided for under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity may thereafter be provided for under this subsection (or section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to a participant or former participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.
<br>
<br>(C) After the death of a participant or former participant, a court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of any former spouse under this section.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) For each full month after a former spouse of a participant or former participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60, the annuity of the participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(B) Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 4046(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.
<br>(c) Additional survivor annuity
<br>
<br>(1) In the case of any participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity benefit under subsection (b) for a former spouse—
<br>
<br>(A) such participant may elect, or
<br>
<br>(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may provide for,
<br>
<br>an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State.
<br>
<br>(2) Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant or former participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section and section 4046 of this title, shall exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) In accordance with regulations which the Secretary of State shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the salary of the participant,
<br>
<br>(ii) by a lump sum payment or installment payments to the Fund, or
<br>
<br>(iii) by any combination thereof.
<br>
<br>(B) The present value of the total amount to accrue to the Fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary of State.
<br>
<br>(C) If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 60 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)—
