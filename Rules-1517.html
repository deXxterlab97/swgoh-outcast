<br>(B) Partner contributions
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (D), for local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the covered portions of funding for a fiscal year shall be provided to the Governor from the programs described in subsection (b)(1), to assist in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in those local areas of the State not adequately funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).
<br>(C) Determination of Governor
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clause (ii) and subparagraph (D), the Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, local boards, and the State board, shall determine the portion of funds to be provided under subparagraph (B) by each one-stop partner from each program described in subparagraph (B). In making such determination for the purpose of determining funding contributions, for funding pursuant to clause (i)(II) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) by each partner, the Governor shall calculate amounts for the proportionate use of the one-stop centers in the State, consistent with chapter II of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), taking into account the costs of administration of the one-stop delivery system for purposes not related to one-stop centers, for each partner. The Governor shall exclude from such determination of funds the amounts for proportionate use of one-stop centers attributable to the programs of one-stop partners for those local areas of the State where the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers are funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The Governor shall also take into account the statutory requirements for each partner program and the partner program's ability to fulfill such requirements.
<br>(ii) Special rule

Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), or vocational rehabilitation services offered under a provision covered by section 3102(13)(D) of this title, the determination described in clause (i) with respect to the programs authorized under that subchapter, Act, or provision shall be made by the chief officer of the entity, or the official, with such authority in consultation with the Governor.
<br>(D) Limitations
<br>(i) Provision from administrative funds
<br>(I) In general

<br>Subject to subclause (II), the funds provided under this paragraph by each one-stop partner shall be provided only from funds available for the costs of administration under the program administered by such partner, and shall be subject to the program's limitations with respect to the portion of funds under such program that may be used for administration.
<br>(II) Exceptions

<br>(II) Other one-stop partners
<br>
<br>The portion of funds required to be contributed under this paragraph from a program described in subsection (b)(1) other than the programs described in subclause (I) shall not exceed 1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year.

<br>
<br>(bb) 1.0 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for the third full program year that begins after such date;

<br>
<br>For local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), an entity administering a program funded with direct spending as defined in section 900(c)(8) of title 2, as in effect on February 15, 2014 3 shall not be required to provide, for purposes of this paragraph, an amount in excess of the amount determined under subparagraph (C)(i) to be equivalent to the cost of the proportionate use of the one-stop centers for the one-stop partner for such program in the State.

Such a determination may be appealed under the process on the basis that such determination is inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph. Such process shall ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of section 3242(e) of this title.

<br>The State board shall develop a formula to be used by the Governor to allocate the funds provided under paragraph (1) to local areas not funding costs of infrastructure under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The formula shall be based on factors including the number of one-stop centers in a local area, the population served by such centers, the services provided by such centers, and other factors relating to the performance of such centers that the State board determines are appropriate.
