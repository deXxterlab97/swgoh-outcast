<br>
<br>The Global Fragility Strategy established pursuant to section 9803 of this title—
<br>
<br>(1) may, after consultation with the appropriate congressional committees, be supported with funds other than funds authorized to be appropriated pursuant to section 9808 of this title; and

<br>
<br>Pursuant to sections 2357 and 2392 of this title, and consistent with subsection (b), and after consultation with the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of State is authorized to establish funding mechanisms, to include the establishment of a Global Fragility Fund, to leverage, receive, coordinate, and program funds provided by other donors and private sector partners to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(2) Purposes
<br>
<br>A funding mechanism established pursuant to paragraph (1) should—
<br>
<br>(A) include input from and participation by key bilateral and multilateral donors, representatives of civil society, relevant nongovernmental organizations and private sector entities, and developing countries where fragility threatens to exacerbate violent extremism and undermine development;
<br>
<br>(B) enhance donor coordination and cooperation;
<br>
<br>(C) advance clearly defined goals, objectives, and metrics for monitoring, evaluating, and measuring progress; and

<br>Sec.
<br>9901.
<br>Findings.

<br>Report from each mission on matters of commercial relations.
<br>9903.
<br>Consolidated report on unified investment climate statement and country commercial guide.

<br>Improving awareness of United States Government tools and services to support United States businesses overseas.
<br>
<br>        
<br>§9901. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) According to the 2017 National Security Strategy of the United States of America, "Retaining our position as the world's preeminent economic actor strengthens our ability to use the tools of economic diplomacy for the good of Americans and others.".
<br>
<br>(2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo to all diplomatic and consular posts—"Boosting Commercial Diplomacy Around the World"—stated that "helping American companies is a foreign policy priority. . .Promoting broad-based, responsible, and sustainable economic growth helps to stabilize regions and creates new and growing markets for U.S. companies. A transparent and level playing field for U.S. investment in these countries counters real and growing challenges such as China's Belt and Road initiative.".
<br>
<br>(3) In the January–February 2019 issue of The Foreign Service Journal, Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, the President of the American Foreign Service Association, wrote, "Foreign Service support for American business. . .is a major reason why the U.S. Foreign Service was created.".

<br>(d) Reporting requirement
<br>
<br>Not later than 3 months after January 1, 2021, and not less frequently than once every 6 months thereafter during the transitional period, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the extent to which the transitional government of Sudan has taken demonstrable steps to strengthen governance and improve fiscal transparency, including—
<br>
<br>(1) establishing civilian control over the finances and assets of the Sudanese security and intelligence services;
<br>
<br>(2) developing a transparent budget that accounts for all expenditures related to the security and intelligence services;
<br>
