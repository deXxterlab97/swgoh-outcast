<br>§8340. Cost-of-living adjustment of annuities
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "base quarter", as used with respect to a year, means the calendar quarter ending on September 30, of such year; and
<br>
<br>(2) the price index for a base quarter is the arithmetical mean of such index for the 3 months comprising such quarter.
<br>
<br>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, effective December 1 of each year, each annuity payable from the Fund having a commencing date not later than such December 1 shall be increased by the percent change in the price index for the base quarter of such year over the price index for the base quarter of the preceding year in which an adjustment under this subsection was made, adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent.
<br>
<br>(c) Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section is governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The first increase (if any) made under subsection (b) of this section to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to an employee or Member who retires, to the widow, widower, or former spouse,1 of a deceased employee or Member, or to the widow, widower, former spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been increased under this subsection or subsection (b) of this section, shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent) of—
<br>
<br>(A) 1/12 of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (b) of this section, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month)—
<br>
<br>(i) for which the annuity was payable from the Fund before the effective date of the increase, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a widow, widower, former spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been so increased, since the annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.
<br>
<br>(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the Fund to an annuitant's survivor (except a child entitled under section 8341(e) of this title), which annuity commences the day after the death of the annuitant and after the effective date of the first increase under this section, shall be increased by the total percent increase the annuitant was receiving under this section at death. However, the increase in a survivor annuity authorized by section 8 of the Act of May 29, 1930, as amended to July 6, 1950, shall be computed as if the annuity commencing date had been the effective date of the first increase under this section.
<br>
<br>(3) For the purpose of computing the annuity of a child under section 8341(e) of this title that commences after October 31, 1969, the items $900, $1,080, $2,700, and $3,240 appearing in section 8341(e) of this title shall be increased by the total percent increases allowed and in force under this section on or after such day and, in case of a deceased annuitant, the items 60 percent and 75 percent appearing in section 8341(e) of this title shall be increased by the total percent allowed and in force to the annuitant under this section on or after such day.
<br>
<br>(d) This section does not authorize an increase in an additional annuity purchased at retirement by voluntary contributions.
<br>
<br>(e) The monthly installment of annuity after adjustment under this section shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar. However, the monthly installment shall after adjustment reflect an increase of at least $1.
<br>
<br>(f) Effective September 1, 1966, or on the commencing date of annuity, whichever is later, the annuity of each surviving spouse whose entitlement to annuity payable from the Fund resulted from the death of—
<br>
<br>(1) an employee or Member before October 11, 1962; or
<br>
<br>(2) a retired employee or Member whose retirement was based on a separation from service before October 11, 1962;
<br>
<br>is increased by 10 percent.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) the maximum pay payable for GS–15 30 days before the effective date of the adjustment under this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the employee or Member with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in rates of pay of the General Schedule under subchapter I of chapter 53 of this title during the period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on the date the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired employee or Member, the date the employee's or Member's annuity commenced), and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, "pay" means the rate of salary or basic pay as payable under any provision of law, including any provision of law limiting the expenditure of appropriated funds.

<br>§8341. Survivor annuities
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "widow" means the surviving wife of an employee or Member who—
<br>
<br>(A) was married to him for at least 9 months immediately before his death; or
<br>
<br>(B) is the mother of issue by that marriage;
<br>
<br>(2) "widower" means the surviving husband of an employee or Member who—
<br>
<br>(A) was married to her for at least 9 months immediately before her death; or
<br>
<br>(B) is the father of issue by that marriage;
<br>
<br>(3) "dependent", in the case of any child, means that the employee or Member involved was, at the time of the employee or Member's death, either living with or contributing to the support of such child, as determined in accordance with such regulations as the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe; and
<br>
<br>(4) "child" means—
<br>
<br>(A) an unmarried dependent child under 18 years of age, including (i) an adopted child, and (ii) a stepchild but only if the stepchild lived with the employee or Member in a regular parent-child relationship, and (iii) a recognized natural child, and (iv) a child who lived with and for whom a petition of adoption was filed by an employee or Member, and who is adopted by the surviving spouse of the employee or Member after his death;
<br>
<br>(B) such unmarried dependent child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18; or
<br>
<br>(C) such unmarried dependent child between 18 and 22 years of age who is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study or training in residence in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution.
<br>
<br>For the purpose of this paragraph and subsection (e) of this section, a child whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1 or after August 31 of a calendar year, and while he is regularly pursuing such a course of study or training, is deemed to have become 22 years of age on the first day of July after that birthday. A child who is a student is deemed not to have ceased to be a student during an interim between school years if the interim is not more than 5 months and if he shows to the satisfaction of the Office of Personnel Management that he has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training in the same or different school during the school semester (or other period into which the school year is divided) immediately after the interim.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if an employee or Member dies after having retired under this subchapter and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent (or 50 percent if retired before October 11, 1962) of an annuity computed under section 8339(a)–(i), (n), (p), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply with respect to the annuitant, or of such portion thereof as may have been designated for this purpose under section 8339(j)(1) of this title, unless the right to a survivor annuity was waived under such section 8339(j)(1) or, in the case of remarriage, the employee or Member did not file an election under section 8339(j)(5)(C) or section 8339(k)(2) of this title, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(2) If an annuitant—
<br>
<br>(A) who retired before April 1, 1948; or
<br>
<br>(B) who elected a reduced annuity provided in paragraph (2) of section 8339(k) of this title;
<br>
<br>dies and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity in an amount which would have been paid had the annuitant been married to the widow or widower at the time of retirement.
<br>
<br>(3) A spouse acquired after retirement is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection only upon electing this annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which he may be entitled under this subchapter or another retirement system for Government employees. The annuity of the widow or widower under this subsection commences on the day after the annuitant dies. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower—
<br>
<br>(A) dies; or
<br>
<br>(B) except as provided in subsection (k), remarries before becoming 55 years of age.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the annuity payable under this subsection to the widow or widower of a retired employee or Member may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this subsection (determined without regard to any waiver or designation under section 8339(j)(1) of this title or a prior similar provision of law), and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of the survivor annuity payable to any former spouse of such employee or Member under subsection (h) of this section.
<br>
<br>(c) The annuity of a survivor named under section 8339(k)(1) of this title is 55 percent of the reduced annuity of the retired employee or Member. The annuity of the survivor commences on the day after the retired employee or Member dies. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the survivor dies.
<br>
<br>(d) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, his widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of an annuity computed under section 8339(a)–(f), (i), (n), (p), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply with respect to the employee or Member, except that, in the computation of the annuity under such section, the annuity of the employee or Member shall be at least the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(1) 40 percent of his average pay; or
<br>
<br>(2) the sum obtained under such section after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 60 years of age.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the annuity payable under this subsection to the widow or widower of an employee or Member may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this subsection, and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of the survivor annuity payable to any former spouse of such employee or Member under subsection (h) of this section.
<br>
<br>The annuity of the widow or widower commences on the day after the employee or Member dies. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower—
<br>
<br>(i) dies; or
<br>
<br>(ii) except as provided in subsection (k), remarries before becoming 55 years of age.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) For the purposes of this subsection, "former spouse" includes a former spouse who was married to an employee or Member for less than 9 months and a former spouse of an employee or Member who completed less than 18 months of service covered by this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, or an employee or Member dies after retiring under this subchapter, and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of—
<br>
<br>(A) 60 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;
<br>
<br>(B) $900; or
<br>
<br>(C) $2,700 divided by the number of children;
<br>
<br>subject to section 8340 of this title. If the employee or Member is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of—
<br>
<br>(i) 75 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;
<br>
<br>(ii) $1,080; or
<br>
<br>(iii) $3,240 divided by the number of children;
<br>
<br>subject to section 8340 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The annuity of a child under this subchapter or under the Act of May 29, 1930, as amended from and after February 28, 1948, commences on the day after the employee or Member dies, or commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by subsection (a)(3) of this section, if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child—
<br>
<br>(A) becomes 18 years of age unless he is then a student as described or incapable of self-support;
<br>
<br>(B) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then such a student;
<br>
<br>(C) becomes 22 years of age if he is then such a student and capable of self-support;
<br>
<br>(D) ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then incapable of self-support; or
<br>
<br>(E) dies or marries;
<br>
<br>whichever first occurs. On the death of the surviving spouse or former spouse or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the spouse, former spouse, or child had not survived the employee or Member.
<br>
<br>(4) If the annuity of a child under this subchapter terminates under paragraph (3)(E) because of marriage, then, if such marriage ends, such annuity shall resume on the first day of the month in which it ends, but only if—
<br>
<br>(A) any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; and
<br>
<br>(B) that individual is not otherwise ineligible for such annuity.
<br>
<br>(f) If a Member heretofore or hereafter separated from the service with title to deferred annuity from the Fund hereafter dies before having established a valid claim for annuity and is survived by a spouse to whom married at the date of separation, the surviving spouse—
<br>
<br>(1) is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the deferred annuity of the Member commencing on the day after the Member dies and terminating on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse dies or remarries; or
<br>
<br>(2) may elect to receive the lump-sum credit instead of annuity if the spouse is the individual who would be entitled to the lump-sum credit and files application therefor with the Office before the award of the annuity.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an annuity payable under this subsection to the surviving spouse of a Member may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such surviving spouse under this subsection, and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of the survivor annuity payable to any former spouse of such Member under subsection (h) of this section.
<br>
<br>(g) In the case of a surviving spouse whose annuity under this section is terminated because of remarriage before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the surviving spouse elects to receive this annuity instead of a survivor benefit to which he may be entitled, under this subchapter or another retirement system for Government employees, by reason of the remarriage; and
<br>
<br>(2) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection, a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, annuitant, or former Member who was separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8338(b) of this title is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this subsection may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount applicable in the case of such former spouse, as determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of any annuity payable under this subsection to any other former spouse of the employee, Member, or annuitant, based on an election previously made under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or a court order previously issued.
<br>
<br>(B) The applicable amount, for purposes of subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph in the case of a former spouse, is the amount which would be applicable—
<br>
<br>(i) under subsection (b)(4)(A) of this section in the case of a widow or widower, if the deceased was an employee or Member who died after retirement;
<br>
<br>(ii) under subparagraph (A) of subsection (d) of this section in the case of a widow or widower, if the deceased was an employee or Member described in the first sentence of such subsection; or
<br>
<br>(iii) under subparagraph (A) of subsection (f) of this section in the case of a surviving spouse, if the deceased was a Member described in the first sentence of such subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this subsection shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not commence before—
<br>
<br>(i) the day after the employee, Member, or annuitant dies, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Office receives written notice of the order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, together with such additional information or documentation as the Office may prescribe,
<br>
<br>whichever is later, and
<br>
<br>(B) shall terminate—
<br>
<br>(i) except as provided in subsection (k), in the case of an annuity computed by reference to clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of an annuity computed by reference to clause (iii) of such paragraph, no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries or dies.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective—
<br>
<br>(A) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and
<br>
<br>(B) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) For purposes of this subchapter, a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that it is inconsistent with any joint designation or waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under section 8339(j)(1) of this title or a similar prior provision of law.
<br>
<br>(6) Any payment under this subsection to a person bars recovery by any other person.
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) the death of the employee or Member was accidental; or
<br>
<br>(2) the surviving spouse of such individual had been previously married to the individual and subsequently divorced, and the aggregate time married is at least 9 months.
<br>
<br>(k)(1) 1 Subsections (b)(3)(B), (d)(ii), and (h)(3)(B)(i) (to the extent that they provide for termination of a survivor annuity because of a remarriage before age 55) shall not apply if the widow, widower, or former spouse was married for at least 30 years to the individual on whose service the survivor annuity is based.

<br>"(A) the retired employee or Member elects, in writing, within eighteen months after the date of enactment of this Act, according to procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have the annuity of such employee or Member reduced under section 8339(j) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, and, except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, to deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which such employee or Member's annuity would have been reduced had the reduction been in effect since such employee or Member's annuity commenced, plus interest computed at the annual rate of six percent for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the date the annuity commenced; or
<br>
<br>"(B) where the employee or Member dies or died on or before the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act or does not make the election described in subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>"(i) the former spouse's marriage to the employee or Member was dissolved after September 14, 1978, and before May 8, 1987;
<br>
<br>"(ii) the former spouse was married to the employee or Member for at least ten years during periods of creditable service under section 8332 of title 5, United States Code;
<br>
<br>"(iii) the former spouse has not remarried before age fifty-five after September 14, 1978;
<br>
<br>"(iv) the former spouse files an application for the survivor annuity with the Office on or before May 7, 1989; and
<br>
<br>"(v) the former spouse is at least fifty years of age on May 7, 1987.
<br>
<br>A survivor annuity under subparagraph (B) shall commence on the day after the employee or Member dies or the first day of the second month after the former spouse's application is received by the Office, whichever occurs later.
<br>
<br>"(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a retired employee or Member who makes an election under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) does not make the deposit required by such subparagraph, the Office shall collect the amount of the deposit by offset against the employee or Member's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 per centum of the net annuity otherwise payable to the employee or Member, and the employee or Member is deemed to consent to such offset.
<br>
<br>"(3) An election made by an individual under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide a survivor annuity for any person prospectively voids any election previously made by such individual with respect to such person under section 8339(k)(1) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, or any similar prior provision of law. Notwithstanding the provisions of such subparagraph (A), an individual who made such an election under such section 8339(k)(1) (or prior provision) shall not be required to make the deposit described in such subparagraph.
<br>
<br>"(4)(A) A former spouse of an employee or Member referred to in the matter before subparagraph (A) in paragraph (1) of this section shall be entitled to a survivor annuity under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph if—
<br>
<br>"(i) the former spouse satisfies the requirements of clauses (ii) through (v) of such subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>"(ii) there is no surviving spouse of the employee or Member and no other former spouse of such employee or Member who is entitled to receive a survivor annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, based on the service of such employee or Member which is creditable under such subchapter and there is no other person who has been designated to receive a survivor annuity under such subchapter by reason of an insurable interest in such employee or Member.
<br>
<br>"(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term 'surviving spouse' means a widow or a widower as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively, of section 8341(a) of title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(5) A survivor annuity provided under this subsection shall be 55 per centum of the annuity of the retired employee or Member (or of that portion of the annuity which such employee or Member may have designated for this purpose under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection), as determined under section 8339(a)–(i) and (n) of title 5, United States Code, increased by—
<br>
<br>"(A) the total percent increase the retired employee or Member was receiving under section 8340 of such title at death, or
<br>
<br>"(B) in the case of a retired employee or Member whose date of death precedes the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 8, 1984], the total percent increase the retired employee or Member would have received under such section 8340 had such individual died on the one hundred and eightieth day after such date of enactment,
<br>
<br>and shall not be subject to reduction under section 8341(h)(2) of such title, as amended by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, an employee or Member who retired before the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 8, 1984] and who is married to a spouse acquired after retirement for whom such employee or Member was unable to provide a survivor annuity because—
<br>
<br>"(1) the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and elected not to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member's spouse at the time of retirement, or
<br>
<br>"(2) the employee or Member failed to notify the Office of the employee or Member's post-retirement marriage within one year after the marriage,
<br>
<br>may elect in writing, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Office, to provide for a survivor annuity for such spouse under section 8341(b) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act, to have the retired employee or Member's annuity reduced under section 8339(j) of such title, as so amended, and to deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which such employee or Member's annuity would have been reduced had the election been continuously in effect since the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. If the retired employee or Member does not make such deposit, the Office shall collect such amount by offset against such employee or Member's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to such employee or Member, and such employee or Member is deemed to consent to such offset. The Office shall provide for general public notice of the right to make an election under this subsection. In cases to which paragraph (2) of this subsection applies, the retired employee or Member shall provide the Office with such documentation as the Office shall decide is appropriate, that such employee or Member attempted to elect a reduced annuity with survivor benefit for such employee or Member's current spouse and that such employee or Member's election was rejected by the Office because it was untimely filed.
<br>
<br>"(d) A deposit required by subsection (b)(1)(A) or (c) of this section may be made by the surviving former spouse or spouse, as applicable, of the retired employee or Member.
<br>
<br>"(e) The Office shall determine at the end of each fiscal year—
<br>
<br>"(1) the cost of survivor annuities provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, less an amount determined appropriate by the Office to reflect the value of any deposits made under subsection (b)(1)(A), (c), or (d), and
<br>
<br>"(2) the cost of administering subsections (b) and (c).
<br>
<br>The Office shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts so determined. The Secretary of the Treasury, before closing the account for the fiscal year in question, shall credit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts, which shall be available in the same manner as provided under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 8348(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(f) Any individual—
<br>
<br>"(1) who is entitled to a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section or pursuant to an election authorized by reason of the application of subsection (a)(5) of this section,
<br>
<br>"(2) as to whom a court order or decree referred to in section 8345(j) of title 5, United States Code (or similar provision of law under a retirement system for Government employees other than the Civil Service Retirement System) has been issued before May 7, 1985, or
<br>
<br>"(3) who is entitled (other than as described in paragraph (2)) to an annuity or any portion of an annuity as a former spouse under a retirement system for Government employees as of May 7, 1985,
<br>
<br>shall be considered to have satisfied section 8901(10)(C) of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, any such individual who otherwise meets the definition of a former spouse under section 8901 of title 5, United States Code, as so amended, may, within 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 [Feb. 27, 1986], enroll in an approved health benefits plan described by section 8903 of such title, under the conditions set forth in section 8905(c) of such title, as so amended (other than the conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of such section 8905(c)).
<br>
<br>"(g)(1) For purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b), (c), (d), and (e), 'employee', 'Member', and 'former spouse' each has the meaning given that term under section 8331 of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), 'employee' and 'annuitant' each has the meaning given that term under section 8901 of title 5, United States Code.

<br>
<br>1 So in original. No subsec. (j) has been enacted.
<br>§8342. Lump-sum benefits; designation of beneficiary; order of precedence
<br>
<br>(a) Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an employee or Member who—
<br>
<br>(1)(A) is separated from the service for at least thirty-one consecutive days; or
<br>
<br>(B) is transferred to a position in which he is not subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, and remains in such a position for at least thirty-one consecutive days;
<br>
<br>(2) files an application with the Office of Personnel Management for payment of the lump-sum credit;
<br>
<br>(3) is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, at the time he files the application; and
<br>
<br>(4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application,
<br>
<br>is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Except as provided in section 8343a or 8334(d)(2) of this title, the receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the employee or Member voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the employee or Member is reemployed in the service subject to this subchapter. In applying this subsection to an employee or Member who becomes subject to chapter 84 (other than by an election under title III of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986) and who, while subject to such chapter, files an application with the Office for a payment under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) entitlement to payment of the lump-sum credit shall be determined without regard to paragraph (1) or (3) if, or to the extent that, such lump-sum credit relates to service of a type described in clauses (i) through (iii) of section 302(a)(1)(C) of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if, or to the extent that, the lump-sum credit so relates to service of a type referred to in clause (i), it shall (notwithstanding section 8331(8)) consist of—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount by which any unrefunded amount described in section 8331(8)(A) or (B) relating to such service, exceeds 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service; and
<br>
<br>(II) interest on the amount payable under subclause (I), computed in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of section 8331(8).
<br>
<br>(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Office, a present or former employee or Member may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries for the purpose of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(c) Lump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (d)–(f) of this section shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the employee or Member and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
<br>
<br>First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or Member in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before his death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.
<br>
<br>Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee or Member.
<br>
<br>Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee or Member and descendants of deceased children by representation.
<br>
<br>Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of the employee or Member or the survivor of them.
<br>
<br>Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee or Member.
<br>
<br>Sixth, if none of the above, to such other next of kin of the employee or Member as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee or Member at the date of his death.
<br>
<br>For the purpose of this subsection, "child" includes a natural child and an adopted child, but does not include a stepchild.
<br>
<br>(d) If an employee or Member dies—
<br>
<br>(1) without a survivor; or
<br>
<br>(2) with a survivor or survivors and the right of all survivors terminates before a claim for survivor annuity is filed;
<br>
<br>or if a former employee or Member not retired dies, the lump-sum credit shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(e) If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(f) If an annuitant dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(g) Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of an annuitant or survivor annuitant shall be paid to that individual. Annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
<br>
<br>First, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor annuitant.
<br>
<br>Second, if there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made, after 30 days from the date of death of the survivor annuitant, to such next of kin of the survivor annuitant as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the survivor annuitant at the date of his death.
<br>
<br>(h) Amounts deducted and withheld from the basic pay of an employee or Member from the first day of the first month which begins after he has performed sufficient service (excluding service which the employee or Member elects to eliminate for the purpose of annuity computation under section 8339 of this title) to entitle him to the maximum annuity provided by section 8339 of this title, together with interest on the amounts at the rate of 3 percent a year compounded annually from the date of the deductions to the date of retirement or death, shall be applied toward any deposit due under section 8334 of this title, and any balance not so required is deemed a voluntary contribution for the purpose of section 8343 of this title.
<br>
<br>(i) An employee who—
<br>
<br>(1) is separated from the service before July 12, 1960; and
<br>
<br>(2) continues in the service after July 12, 1960, without break in service of 1 workday or more;
<br>
