<br>Accessibility of Information on Prescription Drug Container Labels by Visually Impaired and Blind Consumers
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–144, title IX, §904, July 9, 2012, 126 Stat. 1090, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Establishment of Working Group.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (referred to in this section as the 'Access Board') shall convene a stakeholder working group (referred to in this section as the 'working group') to develop best practices on access to information on prescription drug container labels for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.
<br>
<br>"(2) Members.—The working group shall be comprised of representatives of national organizations representing blind and visually impaired individuals, national organizations representing the elderly, and industry groups representing stakeholders, including retail, mail-order, and independent community pharmacies, who would be impacted by such best practices. Representation within the working group shall be divided equally between consumer and industry advocates.
<br>
<br>"(3) Best practices.—
<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—The working group shall develop, not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [July 9, 2012], best practices for pharmacies to ensure that blind and visually impaired individuals have safe, consistent, reliable, and independent access to the information on prescription drug container labels.
<br>
<br>"(B) Public availability.—The best practices developed under subparagraph (A) may be made publicly available, including through the Internet Web sites of the working group participant organizations, and through other means, in a manner that provides access to interested individuals, including individuals with disabilities.
<br>
<br>"(C) Limitations.—The best practices developed under subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as accessibility guidelines or standards of the Access Board, and shall not confer any rights or impose any obligations on working group participants or other persons. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or condition any right, obligation, or remedy available under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) or any other Federal or State law requiring effective communication, barrier removal, or nondiscrimination on the basis of disability.
<br>
<br>"(4) Considerations.—In developing and issuing the best practices under paragraph (3)(A), the working group shall consider—
<br>
<br>"(A) the use of—
<br>
<br>"(i) Braille;
<br>
<br>"(ii) auditory means, such as—
<br>
<br>     "(I) 'talking bottles' that provide audible container label information;
<br>
<br>     "(II) digital voice recorders attached to the prescription drug container; and
<br>
<br>     "(III) radio frequency identification tags;
<br>
<br>"(iii) enhanced visual means, such as—
<br>
<br>     "(I) large font labels or large font 'duplicate' labels that are affixed or matched to a prescription drug container;
<br>
<br>     "(II) high-contrast printing; and
<br>
<br>     "(III) sans-serif font; and
<br>
<br>"(iv) other relevant alternatives as determined by the working group;
<br>
<br>"(B) whether there are technical, financial, manpower, or other factors unique to pharmacies with 20 or fewer retail locations which may pose significant challenges to the adoption of the best practices; and
<br>
<br>"(C) such other factors as the working group determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(5) Information campaign.—Upon completion of development of the best practices under subsection (a)(3), the National Council on Disability, in consultation with the working group, shall conduct an informational and educational campaign designed to inform individuals with disabilities, pharmacists, and the public about such best practices.
<br>
<br>"(6) FACA waiver.—The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the working group.
<br>
<br>"(b) GAO Study.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Beginning 18 months after the completion of the development of best practices under subsection (a)(3)(A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a review of the extent to which pharmacies are utilizing such best practices, and the extent to which barriers to accessible information on prescription drug container labels for blind and visually impaired individuals continue.
<br>
<br>"(2) Report.—Not later than September 30, 2016, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the review conducted under paragraph (1). Such report shall include recommendations about how best to reduce the barriers experienced by blind and visually impaired individuals to independently accessing information on prescription drug container labels.
<br>
<br>"(c) Definitions.—In this section—
<br>
<br>"(1) the term 'pharmacy' includes a pharmacy that receives prescriptions and dispenses prescription drugs through an Internet Web site or by mail;
<br>
<br>"(2) the term 'prescription drug' means a drug subject to section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)); and
<br>
<br>"(3) the term 'prescription drug container label' means the label with the directions for use that is affixed to the prescription drug container by the pharmacist and dispensed to the consumer."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "Access Board".
<br>
<br>2 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized.
<br>§793. Employment under Federal contracts
<br>(a) Amount of contracts or subcontracts; provision for employment and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities; regulations
<br>
<br>Any contract in excess of $10,000 entered into by any Federal department or agency for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States shall contain a provision requiring that the party contracting with the United States shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. The provisions of this section shall apply to any subcontract in excess of $10,000 entered into by a prime contractor in carrying out any contract for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States. The President shall implement the provisions of this section by promulgating regulations within ninety days after September 26, 1973.
<br>(b) Administrative enforcement; complaints; investigations; departmental action
<br>
<br>If any individual with a disability believes any contractor has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of a contract with the United States, relating to employment of individuals with disabilities, such individual may file a complaint with the Department of Labor. The Department shall promptly investigate such complaint and shall take such action thereon as the facts and circumstances warrant, consistent with the terms of such contract and the laws and regulations applicable thereto.
<br>(c) Waiver by President; national interest special circumstances for waiver of particular agreements; waiver by Secretary of Labor of affirmative action requirements
<br>
<br>(1) The requirements of this section may be waived, in whole or in part, by the President with respect to a particular contract or subcontract, in accordance with guidelines set forth in regulations which the President shall prescribe, when the President determines that special circumstances in the national interest so require and states in writing the reasons for such determination.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary of Labor may waive the requirements of the affirmative action clause required by regulations promulgated under subsection (a) with respect to any of a prime contractor's or subcontractor's facilities that are found to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the prime contractor or subcontractor related to the performance of the contract or subcontract, if the Secretary of Labor also finds that such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(B) Such waivers shall be considered only upon the request of the contractor or subcontractor. The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate regulations that set forth the standards used for granting such a waiver.
<br>(d) Standards used in determining violation of section
<br>
<br>The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) and the provisions of sections 501 through 504, and 510,1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12201–12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.
<br>(e) Avoidance of duplicative efforts and inconsistencies
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall develop procedures to ensure that administrative complaints filed under this section and under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.] are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for the same requirements under this section and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

<br>§794e. Protection and advocacy of individual rights
<br>(a) Purpose and construction
<br>(1) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to support a system in each State to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with disabilities who—
<br>
<br>(A) need services that are beyond the scope of services authorized to be provided by the client assistance program under section 732 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B)(i) are ineligible for protection and advocacy programs under subtitle C of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.] because the individuals do not have a developmental disability, as defined in section 102 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 15002]; and
<br>
<br>(ii) are ineligible for services under the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 1 (42 U.S.C. 10801 et seq.) because the individuals are not individuals with mental illness, as defined in section 102 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 10802).
<br>(2) Construction
<br>
<br>This section shall not be construed to require the provision of protection and advocacy services that can be provided under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].
<br>(b) Appropriations less than $5,500,000
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section is less than $5,500,000, the Commissioner may make grants from such amount to eligible systems within States to plan for, develop outreach strategies for, and carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized under this section for individuals with disabilities who meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1).
<br>(c) Appropriations of $5,500,000 or more
<br>(1) Reservations
<br>(A) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section equals or exceeds $5,500,000, the Commissioner shall set aside not less than 1.8 percent and not more than 2.2 percent of the amount to provide a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement for training and technical assistance to the systems established under this section.
<br>(B) Grant for the eligible system serving the American Indian consortium
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section equals or exceeds $10,500,000, the Commissioner shall reserve a portion, and use the portion to make a grant for the eligible system serving the American Indian consortium. The Commission shall make the grant in an amount of not less than $50,000 for the fiscal year.
<br>(2) Allotments
<br>
<br>For any such fiscal year, after the reservations required by paragraph (1) have been made, the Commissioner shall make allotments from the remainder of such amount in accordance with paragraph (3) to eligible systems within States to enable such systems to carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized under this section for individuals referred to in subsection (b).
<br>(3) Systems within States
<br>(A) Population basis
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from such remainder for each such fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to the eligible system within a State of an amount bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.
<br>(B) Minimums
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section, and except as provided in paragraph (4), the allotment to any system under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $100,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of the remainder for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment to any system under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $100,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of such remainder shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.
<br>(4) Systems within other jurisdictions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (3)(B), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be considered to be States.
<br>(B) Allotment
<br>
<br>The eligible system within a jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (3)(A) not less than $50,000 for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made.
<br>(5) Adjustment for inflation
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1999, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this section exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this section for the preceding fiscal year, the Commissioner shall increase each of the minimum grants or allotments under paragraphs (1)(B), (3)(B), and (4)(B) by a percentage that shall not exceed the percentage increase in the total amount appropriated to carry out this section between the preceding fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.
<br>(d) Proportional reduction
<br>
<br>To provide minimum allotments to systems within States (as increased under subsection (c)(5)) under subsection (c)(3)(B), or to provide minimum allotments to systems within States (as increased under subsection (c)(5)) under subsection (c)(4)(B), the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining systems within States under subsection (c)(3), with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining system within a State from being reduced to less than the minimum allotment for a system within a State (as increased under subsection (c)(5)) under subsection (c)(3)(B), or the minimum allotment for a State (as increased under subsection (c)(5)) under subsection (c)(4)(B), as appropriate.
<br>(e) Reallotment
<br>
<br>Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a system within a State for any fiscal year described in subsection (c)(1) will not be expended by such system in carrying out the provisions of this section, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this section to one or more of the systems that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a system for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the system (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.
<br>(f) Application
<br>
<br>In order to receive assistance under this section, an eligible system shall submit an application to the Commissioner, at such time, in such form and manner, and containing such information and assurances as the Commissioner determines necessary to meet the requirements of this section, including assurances that the eligible system will—
<br>
<br>(1) have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(2) have the same general authorities, including the authority to access records and program income, as are set forth in subtitle C of title I of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.];

<br>(4) provide information on and make referrals to programs and services addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities in the State or the American Indian consortium;
<br>
<br>(5) develop a statement of objectives and priorities on an annual basis, and provide to the public, including individuals with disabilities and, as appropriate, the individuals' representatives, an opportunity to comment on the objectives and priorities established by, and activities of, the system including—
<br>
<br>(A) the objectives and priorities for the activities of the system for each year and the rationale for the establishment of such objectives and priorities; and

<br>
<br>(6) establish a grievance procedure for clients or prospective clients of the system to ensure that individuals with disabilities are afforded equal opportunity to access the services of the system; and
<br>
<br>(7) provide assurances to the Commissioner that funds made available under this section will be used to supplement and not supplant the non-Federal funds that would otherwise be made available for the purpose for which Federal funds are provided.
<br>(g) Carryover and direct payment

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commissioner shall pay directly to any system that complies with the provisions of this section, the amount of the allotment of the State or the grant for the eligible system that serves the American Indian consortium involved under this section, unless the State or American Indian consortium provides otherwise.
<br>(2) Carryover
<br>
<br>Any amount paid to an eligible system that serves a State or American Indian consortium for a fiscal year that remains unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such system that serves the State or American Indian consortium for obligation during the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such amount was paid.
<br>(h) Limitation on disclosure requirements
