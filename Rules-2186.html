<br>(b) Computation of disability annuity
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), an annuity payable under subsection (a) shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title. However, if the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the system at the time of retirement, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the participant's age at the time of retirement and age 60.
<br>(2) Coordination with military retired pay and veterans' compensation and pension
<br>
<br>If a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 2082(e)(3) of this title) or Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title, excluding credit for such military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532 1 of title 5, or the Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this section in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under section 2031(a) of this title.
<br>(c) Medical examinations
<br>(1) Medical examination required for determination of disability
<br>
<br>In each case, the participant shall be given a medical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Director to conduct examinations, and disability shall be determined by the Director on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons.
<br>(2) Annual reexaminations until age 60
<br>
<br>Unless the disability is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant becomes age 60. If the Director determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that the annuitant can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency within one year from the date the annuitant's recovery is determined.
<br>(3) Reinstatement
<br>
<br>Upon application, the Director may reinstate any such recovered disability annuitant in the grade held at time of retirement, or the Director may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present grade of the annuitant's contemporaries in the Agency, appoint the annuitant to a grade higher than the one held before retirement.
<br>(4) Termination of disability annuity
<br>
<br>Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date one year after the date of examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency, whichever is earlier.
<br>(5) Payment of fees
<br>
<br>Fees for examinations under this subsection, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, may be paid out of the fund.
<br>(6) Suspension of annuity pending required examination
<br>
<br>If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.
<br>(7) Termination of annuity upon restoration of earning capacity
<br>
<br>If the annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity is restored to earning capacity before becoming age 60, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity shall be considered to be restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment, or both, equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement.
<br>(d) Treatment of recovered disability annuitant who is not reinstated
<br>(1) Separation
<br>
<br>If a recovered or restored disability annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Agency, the annuitant shall be considered, except for service credit, to have been separated within the meaning of section 2054 of this title as of the date of termination of the disability annuity.
<br>(2) Retirement
<br>
<br>After such termination, the recovered or restored annuitant shall be entitled to the benefits of section 2054 or 2071(a) of this title, except that the annuitant may elect voluntary retirement under section 2053 of this title, if qualified thereunder, or may be placed by the Director in an involuntary retirement status under section 2055(a) of this title, if qualified thereunder. Retirement rights under this paragraph shall be based on the provisions of this subchapter in effect as of the date on which the disability annuity is discontinued.
<br>(3) Further disability before age 62
<br>
<br>If, based on a current medical examination, the Director determines that a recovered annuitant has, before reaching age 62, again become totally disabled due to recurrence of the disability for which the annuitant was originally retired, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the date of such medical examination. If a restored-to-earning-capacity annuitant has not medically recovered from the disability for which retired and establishes to the Director's satisfaction that the annuitant's income from wages and self-employment in any calendar year before reaching age 62 was less than 80 percent of the rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the first of the next following year. If the annuitant has been allowed an involuntary or voluntary retirement annuity in the meantime, the annuitant's reinstated disability annuity shall be substituted for it unless the annuitant elects to retain the former benefit.
<br>(e) Coordination of benefits
<br>(1) Workers' compensation
<br>
<br>A participant is not entitled to receive for the same period of time—
<br>
<br>(A) an annuity under this subchapter, and
<br>
<br>(B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such participant under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, other than compensation payable under section 8107 of such title.
<br>(2) Survivor annuities
<br>
<br>An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5 on account of the death of the same person.
<br>(3) Greater benefit
<br>
<br>Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5.
<br>(f) Offset from survivor annuity for workers' compensation payment
<br>(1) Refund to Department of Labor
<br>
<br>If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 of title 5 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department for credit to the Employees' Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall—
<br>
<br>(A) refund to the Secretary of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or
<br>
<br>(B) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.
<br>(2) Source of deduction
<br>
<br>Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Secretary for reimbursement to the Employees' Compensation Fund.
<br>(3) Prorating deduction
<br>
<br>If the Secretary finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.

<br>

<br>Part E—Lump-Sum Payments
<br>§2071. Lump-sum payments
<br>(a) Entitlement to lump-sum credit
<br>
<br>Subject to section 2082(d) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, a participant who—
<br>
<br>(1) is separated from the Agency for at least 31 consecutive days and is not transferred to employment covered by another retirement system for Government employees;
<br>
<br>(2) files an application with the Director for payment of the lump-sum credit;
<br>
<br>(3) is not reemployed in a position in which the participant is subject to this subchapter at the time the participant files the application; and
<br>
<br>(4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity under this subchapter within 31 days after filing the application,
<br>
<br>is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the former participant voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the former participant is reemployed in service subject to this subchapter.
<br>(b) Conditions for payment of lump-sum credit
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever a former participant becomes entitled to receive payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a), such lump-sum credit shall be paid to the former participant and to any former spouse or former wife or husband of the former participant in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (4). The former participant's lump-sum credit shall be reduced by the amount of the lump-sum credit payable to any former spouse or former wife or husband.
<br>(2) Pro rata share for former spouse
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse of the former participant shall be entitled to receive a share of such participant's lump-sum credit—
<br>
<br>(A) if married to the participant throughout the period of creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of such lump-sum credit; or
<br>
<br>(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to a proportion of 50 percent of such lump-sum credit which is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.
<br>(3) Share for former wife or husband
<br>
<br>Payment of the former participant's lump-sum credit shall be subject to the terms of a court order under section 2094(c) of this title concerning any former wife or husband of the former participant if—
<br>
<br>(A) the court order expressly relates to any portion of such lump-sum credit; and
<br>
<br>(B) payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of such former wife or husband to a survivor annuity under section 2036 of this title or to any portion of the participant's annuity under section 2094(c) of this title.
<br>(4) Notification
<br>
<br>A lump-sum credit may be paid to or for the benefit of a former participant—
<br>
<br>(A) only upon written notification to (i) the current spouse, if any, (ii) any former spouse, and (iii) any former wife or husband who has a court order covered by paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(B) only if the express written concurrence of the current spouse has been received by the Director.
<br>
<br>This paragraph may be waived under circumstances described in section 2031(b)(1)(D) of this title.
<br>(c) Order of precedence of payment
<br>
<br>A lump-sum payment authorized by subsection (d) or (e) of this section 2121(d) 1 of this title and a payment of any accrued and unpaid annuity authorized by subsection (f) of this section shall be paid in the following order of precedence to individuals surviving the participant and alive on the date entitlement to the payment arises, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, and such payment bars recovery by any other individual:
<br>
<br>(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by such participant in a signed and witnessed writing received by the Director before the participant's death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed with the Director shall have no force or effect.
<br>
<br>(2) If there is no designated beneficiary, to the surviving wife or husband of such participant.
<br>
<br>(3) If none of the above, to the child or children of such participant and descendent of deceased children by representation.
<br>
<br>(4) If none of the above, to the parents of such participant or the survivor of them.
<br>
<br>(5) If none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such participant.
<br>
<br>(6) If none of the above, to such other next of kin of such participant as the Director determines to be legally entitled to such payment.
<br>(d) Death of former participant before retirement
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a former participant eligible for a deferred annuity under section 2054 of this title dies before reaching age 62, such former participant's lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c).
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>In any case where there is a surviving former spouse or surviving former wife or husband of such participant who is entitled to a share of such participant's lump-sum credit under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b), the lump-sum credit payable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the lump-sum credit payable to such former spouse or former wife or husband.
<br>(e) Termination of all annuity rights
<br>
<br>If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service of a deceased participant or annuitant terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c).
<br>(f) Payment of accrued and unpaid annuity when retired participant dies
<br>
<br>If a retired participant dies, any annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c).
<br>(g) Termination of survivor annuity
<br>
<br>An annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a survivor annuitant shall be paid to that individual. An annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other individual:
<br>
<br>(1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor annuitant.
<br>
<br>(2) If there is no executor or administrator, to such next of kin of the survivor annuitant as the Director determines to be legally entitled to such payment, except that no payment shall be made under this paragraph until after the expiration of 30 days from the date of death of the survivor annuitant.

<br>§2081. Computation of length of service
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Crediting service as participant
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this subchapter, the period of service of a participant shall be computed from the date on which the participant becomes a participant under this subchapter.
<br>(2) Exclusion of certain periods
<br>
<br>In computing the period of service of a participant, all periods of separation from the Agency and so much of any leave of absence without pay as may exceed six months in the aggregate in any calendar year shall be excluded, except leaves of absence while receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5 and leaves of absence granted participants while performing active and honorable service in the Armed Forces.
<br>(3) Crediting certain periods of separation
<br>
<br>A participant or former participant who returns to Government duty after a period of separation shall have included in the participant or former participant's period of service that part of the period of separation in which the participant or former participant was receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5.

<br>
<br>Each year of duty at a post on the list established under paragraph (1), inclusive of regular leaves of absence, shall be counted as one and a half years in computing the length of service of a participant under this subchapter for the purpose of retirement. In computing such service, any fractional month shall be treated as a full month.
<br>(3) Coordination with benefits under title 5
<br>
<br>Extra credit for service at an unhealthful post may not be credited to a participant who is paid a differential under section 5925 or 5928 of title 5 for the same service.

<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the total service of any participant shall exclude—
<br>
<br>(A) any period of civilian service on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made,
<br>
<br>(B) any period of service for which a refund of contributions has been made, or
<br>
<br>(C) any period of service for which contributions were not transferred pursuant to subsection (c)(1);
<br>
<br>unless the participant makes a deposit to the fund in an amount equal to the percentages of basic pay received for such service as specified in the table contained in section 8334(c) of title 5, together with interest computed in accordance with section 8334(e) of such title.

<br>(2) Effect of retirement deductions not made
<br>
<br>If a participant has not paid a deposit for civilian service performed before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions were not made, such participant's annuity shall be reduced by 10 percent of the deposit described in paragraph (1) remaining unpaid, unless the participant elects to eliminate the service involved for the purpose of the annuity computation.
<br>(3) Effect of refund of retirement contributions
<br>
<br>A participant who received a refund of retirement contributions under this or any other retirement system for Government employees covering service for which the participant may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest computed under paragraph (1). Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made, except that a participant who—
<br>
<br>(A) separated from Government service before March 31, 1991, and received a refund of the participant's retirement contributions covering a period of service ending before March 31, 1991;
<br>
<br>(B) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which commences after December 1, 1992; and

<br>(4) Entitlement under another system
<br>
<br>Credit toward retirement under the system shall not be allowed for any period of civilian service on the basis of which the participant is receiving (or will in the future be entitled to receive) an annuity under another retirement system for Government employees, unless the right to such annuity is waived and a deposit is made under paragraph (1) covering that period of service, or a transfer is made pursuant to subsection (c).
<br>(c) Transfer from other Government retirement systems
<br>(1) In general
<br>

<br>(2) Consent of employee
<br>
<br>Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the other Government retirement fund on account of service rendered before becoming a participant in the system.
<br>(3) Additional contributions; refunds
<br>
<br>A participant whose contributions are transferred pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be required to make additional contributions for periods of service for which full contributions were made to the other Government retirement fund, nor shall any refund be made to any such participant on account of contributions made during any period to the other Government retirement fund at a higher rate than that fixed for employees by section 8334(c) of title 5 for contributions to the fund.
<br>(d) Transfer to other Government retirement systems
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a participant in the system becomes an employee under another Government retirement system by direct transfer to employment covered by such system, the Government's contributions (including interest accrued thereon computed in accordance with section 8334(e) of title 5) to the fund on the participant's behalf as well as the participant's total contributions and deposits (including interest accrued thereon), except voluntary contributions, shall be transferred to the participant's credit in the fund of such other retirement system effective as of the date on which the participant becomes eligible to participate in such other retirement system.
<br>(2) Consent of employee
<br>
<br>Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the fund on account of service rendered before the participant's becoming eligible for participation in that other system.
<br>(e) Prior military service credit
<br>(1) Application to obtain credit
<br>
<br>If a deposit required to obtain credit for prior military service described in subsection (a)(2) was not made to another Government retirement fund and transferred under subsection (c)(1), the participant may obtain credit for such military service, subject to the provisions of this subsection and subsections (f) through (h), by applying for it to the Director before retirement or separation from the Agency.
<br>(2) Employment starting before, on, or after October 1, 1982
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3)—
<br>
<br>(A) the service of a participant who first became a Federal employee before October 1, 1982, shall include credit for each period of military service performed before the date of separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based, subject to subsection (f); and
<br>
<br>(B) the service of a participant who first becomes a Federal employee on or after October 1, 1982, shall include credit for—
<br>
<br>(i) each period of military service performed before January 1, 1957, and
<br>
<br>(ii) each period of military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based, only if a deposit (with interest, if any) is made with respect to that period, as provided in subsection (h).
<br>(3) Effect of receipt of military retired pay
<br>
<br>In the case of a participant who is entitled to retired pay based on a period of military service, the participant's service may not include credit for such period of military service unless the retired pay is paid—
<br>
<br>(A) on account of a service-connected disability—
<br>
<br>(i) incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States; or
<br>
<br>(ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (as defined in section 1101 of title 38); or
<br>
<br>(B) under chapter 67 2 of title 10.
<br>(4) Survivor annuity
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the survivor annuity of a survivor of a participant—
<br>
<br>(A) who was awarded retired pay based on any period of military service, and
<br>
<br>(B) whose death occurs before separation from the Agency,
<br>
<br>shall be computed in accordance with section 8332(c)(3) of title 5.
<br>(f) Effect of entitlement to social security benefits
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except paragraph (3) of this subsection) or section 2083 of this title, any military service (other than military service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by a participant after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining the aggregate period of service on which an annuity payable under this subchapter to such participant or to the participant's spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is based, if such participant, spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled), at the time of such determination, to monthly old-age or survivors' insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42, based on such participant's wages and self-employment income. If the military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining age 62, the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the aggregate period of service on which the annuity is based shall be redetermined, effective as of the first day of the month in which the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse attains age 62, so as to exclude such service.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>The provisions of paragraph (1) relating to credit for military service do not apply to—
<br>
<br>(A) any period of military service of a participant with respect to which the participant has made a deposit with interest, if any, under subsection (h); or
<br>
<br>(B) the military service of any participant described in subsection (e)(2)(B).
<br>(3) Effect of entitlement before September 8, 1982
<br>
<br>(A) The annuity recomputation required by paragraph (1) shall not apply to any participant who was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter on or before September 8, 1982, or who is entitled to a deferred annuity based on separation from the Agency occurring on or before such date. Instead of an annuity recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant's old-age or survivors' insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42. The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the participant's monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's total military wages and deemed additional wages (within the meaning of section 429 of title 42) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the denominator of which is the total of all the participant's wages, including military wages, and all self-employment income that were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar year in which the determination month occurs.
<br>
<br>(B) The reduction determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) shall not be greater than the reduction that would be required under paragraph (1) if such paragraph applied to the participant. The new formula shall be applicable to any annuity payment payable after October 1, 1982, including annuity payments to participants who had previously reached age 62 and whose annuities had already been recomputed.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "determination month" means—
<br>
<br>(i) the first month for which the participant is entitled to old-age or survivors' insurance benefits (or would be entitled to such benefits upon application therefor); or
<br>
<br>(ii) October 1982, in the case of any participant entitled to such benefits for that month.
<br>(g) Deposits paid by survivors
<br>
<br>For the purpose of survivor annuities, deposits authorized by subsections (b) and (h) may also be made by the survivor of a participant.
<br>(h) Deposits for periods of military service
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Each participant who has performed military service before the date of separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based may pay to the Agency an amount equal to 7 percent of the amount of basic pay paid under section 204 of title 37 to the participant for each period of military service after December 1956; except, the amount to be paid for military service performed beginning on January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2000, shall be as follows:
<br>
<br>   	 	 
<br>  	7.25 percent of basic pay 	January 1, 1999, to December 31, 1999.
<br>  	7.4 percent of basic pay 	January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2000.
<br>
<br>(B) The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the participant may provide or, if the Director determines sufficient evidence has not been provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the Director under paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(2) Any deposit made under paragraph (1) more than two years after the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) October 1, 1983, or
<br>
<br>(B) the date on which the participant making the deposit first becomes an employee of the Federal Government,
<br>
<br>shall include interest on such amount computed and compounded annually beginning on the date of expiration of the two-year period. The interest rate that is applicable in computing interest in any year under this paragraph shall be equal to the interest rate that is applicable for such year under section 8334(e) of title 5.
<br>
<br>(3) Any payment received by the Director under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.
<br>
<br>(4) The provisions of section 2031(l) of this title shall apply with respect to such information as the Director determines to be necessary for the administration of this subsection in the same manner that such section applies concerning information described in that section.

Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Director, but in no event later than on the first day of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Director.
<br>(4) General provisions
<br>
<br>This subsection does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements of the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this subsection. The Director may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from an annuity and paid to a State by the Director shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director.
