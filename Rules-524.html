<br>
<br>The Commission shall grant registration under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied; and

<br>(b) Update of registration
<br>(1) Update
<br>
<br>Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall promptly amend its application for registration under this section if any information or document provided therein becomes materially inaccurate, except that a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is not required to amend—

<br>
<br>(B) listing any material change that occurred to such information or documents during the previous calendar year.
<br>(c) Accountability for ratings procedures
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>The Commission shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of this section in accordance with this chapter with respect to any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if such nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues credit ratings in material contravention of those procedures relating to such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, including procedures relating to the prevention of misuse of nonpublic information and conflicts of interest, that such nationally recognized statistical rating organization—
<br>
<br>(A) includes in its application for registration under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii); or
<br>
<br>(B) makes and disseminates in reports pursuant to section 78q(a) of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>The rules and regulations that the Commission may prescribe pursuant to this chapter, as they apply to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, shall be narrowly tailored to meet the requirements of this chapter applicable to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any other provision of law, neither the Commission nor any State (or political subdivision thereof) may regulate the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nationally recognized statistical rating organization determines credit ratings. Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to afford a defense against any action or proceeding brought by the Commission to enforce the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.
<br>(3) Internal controls over processes for determining credit ratings
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings, taking into consideration such factors as the Commission may prescribe, by rule.
<br>(B) Attestation requirement
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring each nationally recognized statistical rating organization to submit to the Commission an annual internal controls report, which shall contain—

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or revoke the registration of any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or with respect to any person who is associated with, who is seeking to become associated with, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was associated or was seeking to become associated with a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, the Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities or functions of such person, suspend for a period not exceeding 1 year, or bar such person from being associated with a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, bar or revocation is necessary for the protection of investors and in the public interest and that such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such an organization, whether prior to or subsequent to becoming so associated—
<br>
<br>(A) has committed or omitted any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of section 78o(b)(4) of this title, has been convicted of any offense specified in section 78o(b)(4)(B) of this title, or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of section 78o(b)(4) of this title, during the 10-year period preceding the date of commencement of the proceedings under this subsection, or at any time thereafter;
<br>
<br>(B) has been convicted during the 10-year period preceding the date on which an application for registration is filed with the Commission under this section, or at any time thereafter, of—
<br>
<br>(i) any crime that is punishable by imprisonment for 1 or more years, and that is not described in section 78o(b)(4)(B) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a substantially equivalent crime by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction;
<br>
<br>(C) is subject to any order of the Commission barring or suspending the right of the person to be associated with a nationally recognized statistical rating organization;
<br>
<br>(D) fails to file the certifications required under subsection (b)(2);
<br>
<br>(E) fails to maintain adequate financial and managerial resources to consistently produce credit ratings with integrity; 1
<br>
<br>(F) has failed reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing a violation of the securities laws, an individual who commits such a violation, if the individual is subject to the supervision of that person.
<br>(2) Suspension or revocation for particular class of securities
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization with respect to a particular class or subclass of securities, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization does not have adequate financial and managerial resources to consistently produce credit ratings with integrity.
<br>(B) Considerations
<br>
<br>In making any determination under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall consider—
<br>
<br>(i) whether the nationally recognized statistical rating organization has failed over a sustained period of time, as determined by the Commission, to produce ratings that are accurate for that class or subclass of securities; and
<br>
<br>(ii) such other factors as the Commission may determine.
<br>(e) Termination of registration

<br>
<br>In addition to any other authority of the Commission under this chapter, if the Commission finds that a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a credit rating agency, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration under this section of such nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
<br>(f) Representations
<br>(1) Ban on representations of sponsorship by United States or agency thereof

<br>(2) Ban on representation as NRSRO of unregistered credit rating agencies
<br>
<br>It shall be unlawful for any credit rating agency that is not registered under this section as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization to state that such credit rating agency is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered under this chapter.
<br>(3) Statement of registration under Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provisions
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) the provision of consulting, advisory, or other services by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the obligor, or any affiliate of the obligor;
<br>
<br>(C) business relationships, ownership interests, or any other financial or personal interests between a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and the obligor, or any affiliate of the obligor;

<br>
<br>(II) the violation of a rule issued under this subsection affected a rating.
<br>(4) Look-back requirement
<br>(A) Review by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization
<br>
<br>Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, in any case in which an employee of a person subject to a credit rating of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market instrument subject to a credit rating of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization was employed by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization and participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for the person or the securities or money market instruments during the 1-year period preceding the date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating, the nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall—
<br>
<br>(i) conduct a review to determine whether any conflicts of interest of the employee influenced the credit rating; and

<br>
<br>The Commission shall issue final rules in accordance with subsection (n) to prohibit any act or practice relating to the issuance of credit ratings by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization that the Commission determines to be unfair, coercive, or abusive, including any act or practice relating to—
<br>
<br>(A) conditioning or threatening to condition the issuance of a credit rating on the purchase by the obligor or an affiliate thereof of other services or products, including pre-credit rating assessment products, of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization;

<br>
<br>The Commission shall adopt rules requiring a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, at the time at which the nationally recognized statistical rating organization produces a rating, to disclose the certification described in subparagraph (B) to the public in a manner that allows the public to determine the adequacy and level of due diligence services provided by a third party.
<br>(t) Corporate governance, organization, and management of conflicts of interest
<br>(1) Board of directors
<br>
<br>Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall have a board of directors.

<br>At least ½ of the board of directors, but not fewer than 2 of the members thereof, shall be independent of the nationally recognized statistical rating agency. A portion of the independent directors shall include users of ratings from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
<br>(B) Independence determination
<br>
<br>In order to be considered independent for purposes of this subsection, a member of the board of directors of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization—
<br>
<br>(i) may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors or any committee thereof—
<br>
<br>(I) accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the nationally recognized statistical rating organization; or

<br>(C) Compensation and term
<br>
<br>The compensation of the independent members of the board of directors of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall not be linked to the business performance of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and shall be arranged so as to ensure the independence of their judgment. The term of office of the independent directors shall be for a pre-agreed fixed period, not to exceed 5 years, and shall not be renewable.
<br>(3) Duties of board of directors
<br>
<br>In addition to the overall responsibilities of the board of directors, the board shall oversee—

<br>
<br>(B) at least 1 member of the committee is a user of ratings from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

<br>
<br>If the Commission finds that compliance with the provisions of this subsection present an unreasonable burden on a small nationally recognized statistical rating organization, the Commission may permit the nationally recognized statistical rating organization to delegate such responsibilities to a committee that includes at least one individual who is a user of ratings of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
<br>(u) Duty to report tips alleging material violations of law
<br>(1) Duty to report
<br>

<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in paragraph (1) may be construed to require a nationally recognized statistical rating organization to verify the accuracy of the information described in paragraph (1).
<br>(v) Information from sources other than the issuer
<br>
<br>In producing a credit rating, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall consider information about an issuer that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization has, or receives from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization finds credible and potentially significant to a rating decision.

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–203, title IX, §931, July 21, 2010, 124 Stat. 1872, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities and performances of credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, are matters of national public interest, as credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy.
<br>
<br>"(2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, play a critical 'gatekeeper' role in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public oversight and accountability.
<br>
<br>"(3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other financial 'gatekeepers' do, the activities of credit rating agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers.
<br>
<br>"(4) In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers of structured financial products on potential ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give clearer authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<br>
<br>"(5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the economy in the United States and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part of credit rating agencies."

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–291, §2, Sept. 29, 2006, 120 Stat. 1327, provided that: "Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the record and report of the Securities and Exchange Commission made pursuant to section 702 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [Pub. L. 107–204] (116 Stat. 797), hearings before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives during the 108th and 109th Congresses, comment letters to the concept releases and proposed rules of the Commission, and facts otherwise disclosed and ascertained, Congress finds that credit rating agencies are of national importance, in that, among other things—
<br>
<br>"(1) their ratings, publications, writings, analyses, and reports are furnished and distributed, and their contracts, subscription agreements, and other arrangements with clients are negotiated and performed, by the use of the mails and other means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce;
<br>
<br>"(2) their ratings, publications, writings, analyses, and reports customarily relate to the purchase and sale of securities traded on securities exchanges and in interstate over-the-counter markets, securities issued by companies engaged in business in interstate commerce, and securities issued by national banks and member banks of the Federal Reserve System;
<br>
<br>"(3) the foregoing transactions occur in such volume as substantially to affect interstate commerce, the securities markets, the national banking system, and the national economy;
<br>
<br>"(4) the oversight of such credit rating agencies serves the compelling interest of investor protection;
<br>
<br>"(5) the 2 largest credit rating agencies serve the vast majority of the market, and additional competition is in the public interest; and
<br>
<br>"(6) the Commission has indicated that it needs statutory authority to oversee the credit rating industry."
<br>Securities and Exchange Commission Annual Report

<br>§78o–9. Study and rulemaking on assigned credit ratings
<br>(a) Definition
<br>
<br>In this section, the term "structured finance product" means an asset-backed security, as defined in section 3(a)(77) 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(79)], as added by section 941,1 and any structured product based on an asset-backed security, as determined by the Commission, by rule.
<br>(b) Study
<br>
<br>The Commission shall carry out a study of—
<br>
<br>(1) the credit rating process for structured finance products and the conflicts of interest associated with the issuer-pay and the subscriber-pay models;
<br>
<br>(2) the feasibility of establishing a system in which a public or private utility or a self-regulatory organization assigns nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to determine the credit ratings of structured finance products, including—
<br>
<br>(A) an assessment of potential mechanisms for determining fees for the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations;
<br>
<br>(B) appropriate methods for paying fees to the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations;
<br>
<br>(C) the extent to which the creation of such a system would be viewed as the creation of moral hazard by the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>(D) any constitutional or other issues concerning the establishment of such a system;
<br>
<br>(3) the range of metrics that could be used to determine the accuracy of credit ratings; and
<br>
<br>(4) alternative means for compensating nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that would create incentives for accurate credit ratings.
<br>(c) Report and recommendation
<br>
<br>Not later than 24 months after July 21, 2010, the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report that contains—

<br>(d) Rulemaking
<br>(1) Rulemaking
<br>
<br>After submission of the report under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by rule, as the Commission determines is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, establish a system for the assignment of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to determine the initial credit ratings of structured finance products, in a manner that prevents the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured finance product from selecting the nationally recognized statistical rating organization that will determine the initial credit ratings and monitor such credit ratings. In issuing any rule under this paragraph, the Commission shall give thorough consideration to the provisions of section 15E(w) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as that provision would have been added by section 939D of H.R. 4173 (111th Congress), as passed by the Senate on May 20, 2010, and shall implement the system described in such section 939D unless the Commission determines that an alternative system would better serve the public interest and the protection of investors.
