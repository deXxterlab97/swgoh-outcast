<br>
<br>"(1) agency use of administrative leave, and leave that is referred to incorrectly as administrative leave in agency recording practices, has exceeded reasonable amounts—
<br>
<br>"(A) in contravention of—
<br>
<br>"(i) established precedent of the Comptroller General of the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) guidance provided by the Office of Personnel Management; and
<br>
<br>"(B) resulting in significant cost to the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>"(2) administrative leave should be used sparingly;
<br>
<br>"(3) prior to the use of paid leave to address personnel issues, an agency should consider other actions, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) temporary reassignment; and

<br>"(B) transfer;

<br>"(4) an agency should prioritize and expeditiously conclude an investigation in which an employee is placed in administrative leave so that, not later than the conclusion of the leave period—

<br>
<br>"(A) return to duty status; or
<br>
<br>"(B) challenge the decision of the agency;
<br>
<br>"(6) an agency should ensure accurate and consistent recording of the use of administrative leave so that administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; and
<br>
<br>"(7) other forms of excused absence authorized by law should be recorded separately from administrative leave, as defined by the amendments made by this section [see section 1138a of Pub. L. 114–328 set out as a Short Title of 2016 Amendment note under section 101 of this title]."
