<br>"SEC. 202. RULES OF ORIGIN.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—
<br>
<br>"(1) For purposes of implementing the tariff treatment contemplated under the Agreement, goods originate in the territory of a Party if—
<br>
<br>"(A) they are wholly obtained or produced in the territory of either Party or both Parties; or
<br>
<br>"(B) they—
<br>
<br>"(i) have been transformed in the territory of either Party or both Parties so as to be subject to a change in tariff classification as described in the Annex rules or to such other requirements as the Annex rules may provide when no change in tariff classifications occurs, and
<br>
<br>"(ii) meet the other conditions set out in the Annex.
<br>
<br>"(2) A good shall not be considered to originate in the territory of a party [Party] under paragraph (1)(B) merely by virtue of having undergone—
<br>
<br>"(A) simple packaging or, except as expressly provided by the Annex rules, combining operations;
<br>
<br>"(B) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good; or
<br>
<br>"(C) any process or work in respect of which it is established, or in respect of which the facts as ascertained clearly justify the presumption, that the sole object was to circumvent the provisions of chapter 3 of the Agreement.
<br>
<br>"(3) Accessories, spare parts, or tools delivered with any piece of equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle that form part of its standard equipment shall be treated as having the same origin as that equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle if the quantities and values of such accessories, spare parts, or tools are customary for the equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle.
<br>
<br>"(b) Transshipment.—Goods exported from the territory of one Party originate in the territory of that Party only if—
<br>
<br>"(1) the goods meet the applicable requirements of subsection (a) and are shipped to the territory of the other Party without having entered the commerce of any third country;
<br>
<br>"(2) the goods, if shipped through the territory of a third country, do not undergo any operation other than unloading, reloading, or any operation necessary to transport them to the territory of the other Party or to preserve them in good condition; and
<br>
<br>"(3) the documents related to the exportation and shipment of the goods from the territory of a Party show the territory of the other Party as their final destination.
<br>
<br>"(c) Interpretation.—In interpreting this section, the following apply:
<br>
<br>"(1) Whenever the processing or assembly of goods in the territory of either Party or both Parties results in one of the changes in tariff classification described in the Annex rules, such goods shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of that Party and shall be treated as goods originating in the territory of that Party if—
<br>
<br>"(A) such processing or assembly occurs entirely within the territory of either Party or both Parties; and
<br>
<br>"(B) such goods have not subsequently undergone any processing or assembly outside the territories of the Parties that improves the goods in condition or advances them in value.
<br>
<br>"(2) Whenever the assembly of goods in the territory of a Party fails to result in a change of tariff classification because either—
<br>
<br>"(A) the goods were imported into the territory of the Party in an unassembled or a disassembled form and were classified as unassembled or disassembled goods pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the Harmonized System; or
<br>
<br>"(B) the tariff subheading for the goods provides for both the goods themselves and their parts;
<br>
<br>such goods shall not be treated as goods originating in the territory of a Party.
<br>
<br>"(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), goods described in that paragraph shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of a Party and be treated as goods originating in the territory of the Party if—
<br>
<br>"(A) the value of materials originating in the territory of either Party or both Parties used or consumed in the production of the goods plus the direct cost of assembling the goods in the territory of either Party or both Parties constitute not less than 50 percent of the value of the goods when exported to the territory of the other Party; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the goods have not subsequent to assembly undergone processing or further assembly in a third country and they meet the requirements of subsection (b).
<br>
<br>"(4) The provisions of paragraph (3) shall not apply to goods of chapters 61–63 of the Harmonized System.
<br>
<br>"(5) In making the determination required by paragraph (3)(A) and in making the same or a similar determination when required by the Annex rules, where materials originating in the territory of either Party or both Parties and materials obtained or produced in a third country are used or consumed together in the production of goods in the territory of a Party, the value of materials originating in the territory of either Party or both Parties may be treated as such only to the extent that it is directly attributable to the goods under consideration.
<br>
<br>"(6) In applying the Annex rules, a specific rule shall take precedence over a more general rule.

<br>
<br>"(a) Special Tariff Provisions for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.—
<br>
<br>"(1) The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter in this section referred to as the 'Secretary') may recommend to the President the imposition of a temporary duty on any Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable entered into the United States if the Secretary determines that both of the following conditions exist at the time that imposition of the duty is recommended:
<br>
<br>"(A) For each of 5 consecutive working days the import price of the Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable is below 90 percent of the corresponding 5-year average monthly import price for such fruit or vegetable.
<br>
<br>"(B) The planted acreage in the United States for the like fresh fruit or vegetable is no higher than the average planted acreage over the preceding 5 years, excluding the years with the highest and lowest acreage. For the purposes of applying this subparagraph, any acreage increase attributed directly to a reduction in the acreage that was planted to wine grapes as of October 4, 1987, shall be excluded.
<br>
<br>Whenever the Secretary makes a determination that the conditions referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) regarding any Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable exist, the Secretary shall immediately submit for publication in the Federal Register notice of the determination.
<br>
<br>"(2) No later than 6 days after publication in the Federal Register of the notice described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall decide whether to recommend the imposition of a temporary duty to the President, and if the Secretary decides to make such a recommendation, the recommendation shall be forwarded immediately to the President.
<br>
<br>"(3) In determining whether to recommend the imposition of a temporary duty to the President under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider whether the conditions in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph have led to a distortion in trade between the United States and Canada of the fresh fruit or vegetable and, if so, whether the imposition of the duty is appropriate, including consideration of whether it would significantly correct this distortion.
<br>
<br>"(4) Not later than 7 days after receipt of a recommendation of the Secretary under paragraph (1), the President, after taking into account the national economic interests of the United States, shall determine whether to impose a temporary duty on the Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable concerned. If the determination is affirmative, the President shall proclaim the imposition and the rate of the temporary duty, but such duty shall not apply to the entry of articles that were in transit to the United States on the first day on which the temporary duty is in effect.
<br>
<br>"(5) A temporary duty imposed under paragraph (4) shall cease to apply with respect to articles that are entered on or after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>"(A) the day following the last of 5 consecutive working days with respect to which the Secretary determines that the point of shipment price in Canada for the Canadian fruit or vegetable concerned exceeds 90 percent of the corresponding 5-year average monthly import price; or
<br>
<br>"(B) the 180th day after the date on which the temporary duty first took effect.
<br>
<br>"(6) No temporary duty may be imposed under this subsection on a Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable during such time as import relief is provided with respect to such fresh fruit or vegetable under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.].

<br>
<br>"(2)(A) Upon the filing of a petition under paragraph (1), the Commission shall promptly initiate an investigation to determine whether, as a result of a reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, an article originating in Canada is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms, and under such conditions, so that imports of such Canadian article, alone, constitute a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like, or directly competitive with, the imported article.

<br>"(b) Relief From Imports From All Countries.—
<br>
<br>"(1)(A) If, in any investigation initiated under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.], the Commission makes an affirmative determination (or a determination which is treated as an affirmative determination under such chapter by reason of section 330(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1330(d)]) that an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry, the Commission shall also find (and report to the President at the time such injury determination is submitted to the President), whether imports from Canada of the article that is the subject of such investigation are substantial and are contributing importantly to such injury or threat thereof.
<br>
<br>"(B)(i) In determining under subparagraph (A) whether imports of an article from Canada are substantial, the Commission shall not normally consider imports from Canada in the range of 5 to 10 percent or less of total imports of such article to be substantial.
<br>
<br>"(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'contributing importantly' means an important cause, but not necessarily the most important cause, of the serious injury or threat thereof caused by imports.
<br>
<br>"(2)(A) In determining whether to take action under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to imports from Canada, the President shall determine whether imports from Canada of such article are substantial and contributing importantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury found by the Commission.
<br>
<br>"(B) In determining the nature and extent of action to be taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, the President shall exclude from such action imports from Canada if the President has made a negative determination under subparagraph (A) regarding imports from Canada.
<br>
<br>"(3)(A) If, under paragraph (2)(B), the President excludes imports from Canada from action taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, the President may, if the President thereafter determines that a surge in imports from Canada of the article that is the subject of the action is undermining the effectiveness of the action, take appropriate action under such chapter with respect to such imports from Canada to include such imports in such action.
<br>
<br>"(B)(i) If, under paragraph (2)(B), the President excludes imports from Canada from action taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, any entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, that is representative of an industry for which such action is being taken under such chapter may request the Commission to conduct an investigation of imports from Canada of the article that is the subject of such action.
<br>
<br>"(ii) Upon receiving a request under clause (i), the Commission shall conduct an investigation to determine whether a surge in imports from Canada of the article that is the subject of action being taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 undermines the effectiveness of such action. The Commission shall submit the findings of such investigation to the President by no later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which such request is received by the Commission.
<br>
<br>"(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'surge' means a significant increase in imports over the trend for a reasonable, recent base period for which data are available.
<br>
<br>"(c) Any entity that is representative of an industry may submit a petition for relief under subsection (a), under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, or under both subsection (a) and such chapter at the same time. If petitions are submitted by such an entity under subsection (a) and such chapter at the same time, the Commission shall consider such petitions jointly.

Such request shall contain such information and be in such form, manner, and style as the administering authority shall prescribe by regulations. The request for such panel review shall not preclude the United States, Canada, or any other person from challenging before a binational panel the basis for a particular request for review.
<br>

<br>"SEC. 409. SUBSIDIES.
<br>
<br>"(a) Negotiating Authority.—
<br>
<br>"(1) The President is authorized to enter into an agreement with Canada, including an agreement to amend the Agreement, on rules applicable to trade between the United States and Canada that—
<br>
<br>"(A) deal with unfair pricing and government subsidization, and
<br>
<br>"(B) provide for increased discipline on subsidies.
<br>
<br>"(2)(A) The objectives of the United States in negotiating an agreement under paragraph (1) include (but are not limited to)—
<br>
<br>"(i) achievement, on an expedited basis, of increased discipline on government production and export subsidies that have a significant impact, directly or indirectly, on bilateral trade between the United States and Canada; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) attainment of increased and more effective discipline on those Canadian Government (including provincial) subsidies having the most significant adverse impact on United States producers that compete with subsidized products of Canada in the markets of the United States and Canada.
<br>
<br>"(B) Special emphasis should be given in negotiating an agreement under paragraph (1) to obtain discipline on Canadian subsidy programs that adversely affect United States industries which directly compete with subsidized imports.
<br>
<br>"(3) The United States members of the working group established under article 1907 of the Agreement shall consult regularly with the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2155] regarding—
<br>
<br>"(A) the issues being considered by the working group; and
<br>
<br>"(B) as appropriate, the objectives and strategy of the United States in the negotiations.
<br>
<br>"(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or of any other law, the provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191) shall not apply to any bill or joint resolution that implements an agreement entered into under paragraph (1), unless the President determines and notifies the Congress that such agreement—
<br>
<br>"(A) will provide greater discipline over government subsidies and no less discipline over unfair pricing practices by producers than that provided by the agreements described in paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 2[(c)] of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [19 U.S.C. 2503(c)(5), (6)] (the Subsidies Code and Antidumping Code), respectively, taking into account the effects of the Agreement, and
<br>
<br>"(B) will neither undermine such multilateral discipline nor detract from United States efforts to increase such discipline on a multilateral basis in, or subsequent to, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
<br>
<br>"(b) Identification of Industries Facing Subsidized Imports.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Any entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, that is representative of a United States industry and has reason to believe that—
<br>
<br>"(A)(i) as a result of implementation of provisions of the Agreement, the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized Canadian imports with which it directly competes; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized imports with which it directly competes from any other country designated by the President, following consultations with the Congress, as benefitting from a reduction of tariffs or other trade barriers under a trade agreement that enters into force after January 1, 1989; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the industry is likely to experience a deterioration of its competitive position before rules and disciplines relating to the use of government subsidies have been developed with respect to such country;
<br>
<br>may file a petition with the United States Trade Representative (hereafter referred to in this section as the 'Trade Representative') to be identified under this section.
<br>
<br>"(2) Within 90 days of receipt of a petition under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall decide whether to identify the industry on the basis that there is a reasonable likelihood that the industry may face both the subsidization described in paragraph (1)(A) and the deterioration described in paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>"(3) At the request of an entity that is representative of an industry identified under paragraph (2), the Trade Representative shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) compile and make available to the industry information under section 308 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2418],
<br>
<br>"(B) recommend to the President that an investigation by the United States International Trade Commission be requested under section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332], or
<br>
<br>"(C) take actions described in both subparagraphs (A) and (B).
<br>
<br>The industry may request the Trade Representative to take appropriate action to update (as often as annually) any information obtained under subparagraph (A) or (B), or both, as the case may be, until an agreement on adequate rules and disciplines relating to government subsidies is reached.
<br>
<br>"(4)(A) The Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce shall review information obtained under paragraph (3) and consult with the industry identified under paragraph (2) with a view to deciding whether any action is appropriate under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411], including the initiation of an investigation under section 302(c) of that Act [19 U.S.C. 2412(c)] (in the case of the Trade Representative), or under subtitle A of title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], including the initiation of an investigation under section 702(a) of that Act [19 U.S.C. 1671a(a)] (in the case of the Secretary of Commerce).
<br>
<br>"(B) In determining whether to initiate any investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411] or any other trade law, other than title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], the Trade Representative, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce—
<br>
<br>"(i) shall seek the advice of the advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2155];
<br>
<br>"(ii) shall consult with the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives;
<br>
<br>"(iii) shall coordinate with the interagency committee established under section 242 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1872]; and
<br>
<br>"(iv) may ask the President to request advice from the United States International Trade Commission.
<br>
<br>"(C) In the event an investigation is initiated under section 302(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2412(c)] as a result of a review under this paragraph and the President, following such investigation (including any applicable dispute settlement proceedings under the Agreement or any other trade agreement), determines to take action under section 301(a) of such Act [19 U.S.C. 2411(a)], the President shall give preference to actions that most directly affect the products that benefit from governmental subsidies and were the subject of the investigation, unless there are no significant imports of such products or the President otherwise determines that application of the action to other products would be more effective.
<br>
<br>"(5) Any decision, whether positive or negative, or any action by the Trade Representative or the Secretary of Commerce under this section shall not in any way—
<br>
<br>"(A) prejudice the right of any industry to file a petition under any trade law,
<br>
<br>"(B) prejudice, affect, or substitute for, any proceeding, investigation, determination, or action by the Secretary of Commerce, the United States International Trade Commission, or the Trade Representative pursuant to such a petition,
<br>
<br>"(C) prejudice, affect, substitute for, or obviate any proceeding, investigation, or determination under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411], title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], or any other trade law.
<br>
<br>"(6) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to alter in any manner the requirements in effect before the enactment of this Act [Sept. 28, 1988] for standing under any law of the United States or to add any additional requirements for standing under any law of the United States.
<br>"SEC. 410. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.

<br>
<br>"(1) no agreement is entered into between the United States and Canada on a substitute system of rules for antidumping and countervailing duties before the date that is 7 years after the date on which the Agreement enters into force [Jan. 1, 1989], and
<br>
<br>"(2) the President decides not to exercise the rights of the United States under article 1906 of the Agreement to terminate the Agreement,
