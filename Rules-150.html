<br>
<br>Pub. L. 95–454, §3, Oct. 13, 1978, 92 Stat. 1112, provided that: "It is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>"(1) in order to provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and productive Federal work force reflective of the Nation's diversity, and to improve the quality of public service, Federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with merit system principles and free from prohibited personnel practices;
<br>
<br>"(2) the merit system principles which shall govern in the competitive service and in the executive branch of the Federal Government should be expressly stated to furnish guidance to Federal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities in administering the public business, and prohibited personnel practices should be statutorily defined to enable Federal employees to avoid conduct which undermines the merit system principles and the integrity of the merit system;
<br>
<br>"(3) Federal employees should receive appropriate protection through increasing the authority and powers of the Merit Systems Protection Board in processing hearings and appeals affecting Federal employees;
<br>
<br>"(4) the authority and power of the Special Counsel should be increased so that the Special Counsel may investigate allegations involving prohibited personnel practices and reprisals against Federal employees for the lawful disclosure of certain information and may file complaints against agency officials and employees who engage in such conduct;
<br>
<br>"(5) the function of filling positions and other personnel functions in the competitive service and in the executive branch should be delegated in appropriate cases to the agencies to expedite processing appointments and other personnel actions, with the control and oversight of this delegation being maintained by the Office of Personnel Management to protect against prohibited personnel practices and the use of unsound management practices by the agencies;
<br>
<br>"(6) a Senior Executive Service should be established to provide the flexibility needed by agencies to recruit and retain the highly competent and qualified executives needed to provide more effective management of agencies and their functions, and the more expeditious administration of the public business;
<br>
<br>"(7) in appropriate instances, pay increases should be based on quality of performance rather than length of service;
<br>
<br>"(8) research programs and demonstration projects should be authorized to permit Federal agencies to experiment, subject to congressional oversight, with new and different personnel management concepts in controlled situations to achieve more efficient management of the Government's human resources and greater productivity in the delivery of service to the public;
<br>
<br>"(9) the training program of the Government should include retraining of employees for positions in other agencies to avoid separations during reductions in force and the loss to the Government of the knowledge and experience that these employees possess; and
<br>
<br>"(10) the right of Federal employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations in decisions which affect them, with full regard for the public interest and the effective conduct of public business, should be specifically recognized in statute."

<br>
<br>[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. No. 12107, Dec. 28, 1978, 44 F.R. 1055, this Reorg. Plan is generally effective Jan. 1, 1979.]
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>On March 2nd I sent to Congress a Civil Service Reform proposal to enable the Federal government to improve its service to the American people.
<br>
<br>Today I am submitting another part of my comprehensive proposal to reform the Federal personnel management system through Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978. The plan will reorganize the Civil Service Commission and thereby create new institutions to increase the effectiveness of management and strengthen the protection of employee rights.
<br>
<br>The Civil Service Commission has acquired inherently conflicting responsibilities: to help manage the Federal Government and to protect the rights of Federal employees. It has done neither job well. The Plan would separate the two functions.
<br>office of personnel management
<br>
<br>The positive personnel management tasks of the government—such as training, productivity programs, examinations, and pay and benefits administration—would be the responsibility of an Office of Personnel Management. Its Director, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would be responsible for administering Federal personnel matters except for Presidential appointments. The Director would be the government's principal representative in Federal labor relations matters.
<br>merit systems protection board
<br>
<br>The adjudication and prosecution responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission will be performed by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board will be headed by a bipartisan panel of three members appointed to six-year, staggered terms. This Board would be the first independent and institutionally impartial Federal agency solely for the protection of Federal employees.
<br>
<br>The Plan will create, within the Board, a Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute political abuses and merit system violations. Under the civil service reform legislation now being considered by the Congress, the Counsel would have power to investigate and prevent reprisals against employees who report illegal acts—the so-called "whistleblowers." The Council would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
<br>federal labor relations authority
<br>
<br>An Executive Order now vests existing labor-management relations in a part-time Federal Labor-Relations Council, comprised of three top government managers; other important functions are assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations. This arrangement is defective because the Council members are part-time, they come exclusively from the ranks of management and their jurisdiction is fragmented.
<br>
<br>The Plan I submit today would consolidate the central policymaking functions in labor-management relations now divided between the Council and the Assistant Secretary into one Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority would be composed of three full-time members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Its General Counsel, also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would present unfair labor practice complaints. The Plan also provides for the continuance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel within the Authority to resolve negotiating impasses between Federal employee unions and agencies.
<br>
<br>The cost of replacing the Civil Service Commission can be paid by our present resources. The reorganization itself would neither increase nor decrease the costs of personnel management throughout the government. But taken together with the substantive reforms I have proposed, this Plan will greatly improve the government's ability to manage programs, speed the delivery of Federal services to the public, and aid in executing other reorganizations I will propose to the Congress, by improving Federal personnel management.
<br>
<br>Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in 5 U.S.C. 901(a). No functions are abolished by the Plan, but the offices referred to in 5 U.S.C. 5109(b) and 5 U.S.C. 1103(d) are abolished. The portions of the Plan providing for the appointment and pay for the head and one or more officers of the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Federal Service Impasses Panel, are necessary to carry out the reorganization. The rates of compensation are comparable to those for similar positions within the Executive Branch.
<br>
<br>I am confident that this Plan and the companion civil service reform legislation will both lead to more effective protection of Federal employees' legitimate rights and a more rewarding workplace. At the same time the American people will benefit from a better managed, more productive and more efficient Federal Government.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12353. Charitable Fund-Raising
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12353, Mar. 23, 1982, 47 F.R. 12785, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 12404, §1, Feb. 10, 1983, 48 F.R. 6685; Ex. Ord. No. 13743, §1, Oct. 13, 2016, 81 F.R. 71571, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States of America, and in order to support and facilitate fund-raising on behalf of voluntary health and welfare organizations through on-the-job solicitations of Federal employees and members of the uniformed services, and to ensure that the recipient organizations are responsible in the uses of the monies so raised, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1.
<br>
<br>(a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall make arrangements for voluntary health and welfare organizations to solicit contributions from Federal employees and members of the uniformed services at their places of employment or duty. Federal employees and members of the uniformed services can also be solicited to make pledges of volunteer time. These arrangements shall take the form of an annual Combined Federal Campaign in which eligible voluntary health and welfare organizations are authorized to take part.
<br>
<br>(b) The Director shall consider permitting annuitants to make contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign through allotments or assignments of amounts from their Federal annuities. The Director may prescribe rules and regulations to govern the solicitation of such contributions and make arrangements to inform annuitants of their ability to make contributions in this manner.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. (a) The Director shall establish criteria for determining the eligibility of voluntary health and welfare organizations that may participate in each of the annual Combined Federal Campaigns.
<br>
<br>(b) In establishing those criteria, the Director shall be guided by the following principles and policies:
<br>
<br>(1) The objectives of the Combined Federal Campaign are to lessen the burdens of government in meeting needs of human health and welfare; to provide a convenient channel through which Federal public servants may contribute to these efforts; to minimize or eliminate disruption of the Federal workplace and costs to Federal taxpayers that such fund-raising may entail; and to avoid the reality and appearance of the use of Federal resources in aid of fund-raising for political activity or advocacy of public policy, lobbying, or philanthropy of any kind that does not directly serve needs of human health and welfare.
<br>
<br>(2) To meet these objectives, eligibility for participation in the Combined Federal Campaign shall be limited to voluntary, charitable, health and welfare organizations that provide or support direct health and welfare services to individuals or their families. Such direct health and welfare services must be available to Federal employees in the local campaign solicitation area, unless they are rendered to needy persons overseas. Such services must directly benefit human beings, whether children, youth, adults, the aged, the ill and infirm, or the mentally or physically handicapped. Such services must consist of care, research or education in the fields of human health or social adjustment and rehabilitation; relief of victims of natural disasters and other emergencies; or assistance to those who are impoverished and therefore in need of food, shelter, clothing, education, and basic human welfare services.
<br>
<br>(3) Organizations that seek to influence the outcomes of elections or the determination of public policy through political activity or advocacy, lobbying, or litigation on behalf of parties other than themselves shall not be deemed charitable health and welfare organizations and shall not be eligible to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign.
<br>
<br>(4) International organizations that provide health and welfare services overseas, and that meet the eligibility criteria except for the local services criterion, shall be eligible to participate in each local solicitation area of the Combined Federal Campaign.
<br>
<br>(5) Local voluntary, charitable, health and welfare organizations that are not affiliated with a national organization or federation but that satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in this order and by the Director shall be permitted to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. In making arrangements for the Combined Federal Campaign, the Director is authorized, in his discretion, to consult with the Departments and agencies concerned, representatives of the employees and members to be solicited, and, to the extent practicable, representatives of voluntary health and welfare organizations seeking to participate in a Combined Federal Campaign.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The arrangements made by the Director shall (a) ensure that all contributions are voluntary, that there is no coercion, and that individuals have the option of disclosing their contribution or keeping it confidential, (b) designate the specific period during which the annual solicitation may be conducted, and (c) permit only one annual solicitation except in cases of emergency or disaster appeals for which specific provision shall be made by the Director.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Subject to such rules and regulations as the Director may prescribe, the Director may authorize:
<br>
<br>(a) outreach coordinators to conduct campaign promotion in a local Combined Federal Campaign; and
<br>
<br>(b) central campaign administrators to administer application and pledging systems and to collect and disburse pledged funds.
<br>
<br>Such authorizations shall, if made, ensure at a minimum that outreach coordinators and central campaign administrators operate subject to the direction and control of the Director and such local Federal coordinating entities as may be established; and manage the Combined Federal Campaign fairly and equitably. The Director may consult with and consider advice from interested parties and organizations, and shall publish reports on the management and results of the Combined Federal Campaign.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. The methods for the solicitation of funds shall clearly specify the eligible organizations and provide a direct means to designate funds to such organizations. Where allocation of undesignated funds by the central campaign administrator is authorized by the Director, prominent notice of the authorization for such allocation shall be provided.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. This Order shall not apply to solicitations conducted by organizations composed of civilian employees or members of the uniformed services among their own members for organizational support or for the benefit of welfare funds for their members. Such solicitations shall be conducted under policies and procedures approved by the head of the Department or agency concerned.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. The Director shall prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 9. Executive Order No. 10927 [Mar. 18, 1961, 26 F.R. 2383], as amended, is revoked. Notwithstanding that revocation, directives issued under that Order shall continue in effect until revoked or modified under the provisions of this Order.
<br>
<br>[Section 2(d) of Ex. Ord. No. 13743 provided that all rules, regulations, and directives continued or issued under Ex. Ord. No. 12353, set out above, would continue in effect until revoked or modified under the provisions of Ex. Ord. No. 13743.]
<br>
<br>[Section 2 of Ex. Ord. No. 12404 provided that all rules, regulations, and directives continued or issued under Ex. Ord. No. 12353, set out above, would continue in full force and effect until revoked or modified under the provisions of Ex. Ord. No. 12404.]
<br>
<br>1 As amended July 11, 1978.
<br>§1102. Director; Deputy Director; Associate Directors
<br>
<br>(a) There is at the head of the Office of Personnel Management a Director of the Office of Personnel Management appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The term of office of any individual appointed as Director shall be 4 years.
<br>
<br>(b) There is in the Office a Deputy Director of the Office of Personnel Management appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

<br>
<br>(c) No individual shall, while serving as Director or Deputy Director, serve in any other office or position in the Government of the United States except as otherwise provided by law or at the direction of the President. The Director and Deputy Director shall not recommend any individual for appointment to any position (other than Deputy Director of the Office) which requires the advice and consent of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(d) There may be within the Office of Personnel Management not more than 5 Associate Directors, as determined from time to time by the Director. Each Associate Director shall be appointed by the Director.

<br>"(3) in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Pub. L. 95–454, see Tables for classification], Congress established the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistleblowers (those individuals who make disclosures described in such section 2302(b)(8)) from reprisal.

<br>
<br>"(1) mandating that employees should not suffer adverse consequences as a result of prohibited personnel practices; and

<br>(c) In the case of contumacy or failure to obey a subpoena issued under subsection (b)(2)(A) or section 1214(b), upon application by the Board, the United States district court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena is addressed resides or is served may issue an order requiring such person to appear at any designated place to testify or to produce documentary or other evidence. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.
<br>
<br>(d) A subpoena referred to in subsection (b)(2)(A) may, in the case of any individual outside the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States, be served in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service of a subpoena in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over such individual, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance under this subsection by such individual that such court would have if such individual were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.
<br>

<br>(B)(i) The Merit Systems Protection Board may, during an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel or during the pendency of any proceeding before the Board, issue any order which may be necessary to protect a witness or other individual from harassment, except that an agency (other than the Office of Special Counsel) may not request any such order with regard to an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel from the Board during such investigation.
<br>
<br>(ii) An order issued under this subparagraph may be enforced in the same manner as provided for under paragraph (2) with respect to any order under subsection (a)(2).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In enforcing compliance with any order under subsection (a)(2), the Board may order that any employee charged with complying with such order, other than an employee appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall not be entitled to receive payment for service as an employee during any period that the order has not been complied with. The Board shall certify to the Comptroller General of the United States that such an order has been issued and no payment shall be made out of the Treasury of the United States for any service specified in such order.
<br>
<br>(B) The Board shall prescribe regulations under which any employee who is aggrieved by the failure of any other employee to comply with an order of the Board may petition the Board to exercise its authority under subparagraph (A).
<br>

<br>
<br>(f)(1) At any time after the effective date of any rule or regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in carrying out functions under section 1103, the Board shall review any provision of such rule or regulation—
<br>
<br>(A) on its own motion;
<br>
<br>(B) on the granting by the Board, in its sole discretion, of any petition for such review filed with the Board by any interested person, after consideration of the petition by the Board; or
<br>
<br>(C) on the filing of a written complaint by the Special Counsel requesting such review.
<br>
<br>(2) In reviewing any provision of any rule or regulation pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall declare such provision—
<br>
<br>(A) invalid on its face, if the Board determines that such provision would, if implemented by any agency, on its face, require any employee to violate section 2302(b); or
<br>
<br>(B) invalidly implemented by any agency, if the Board determines that such provision, as it has been implemented by the agency through any personnel action taken by the agency or through any policy adopted by the agency in conformity with such provision, has required any employee to violate section 2302(b).
<br>
<br>(3) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the head of any agency implementing any provision of any rule or regulation under review pursuant to this subsection, shall have the right to participate in such review.
<br>
<br>(4) The Board shall require any agency—
<br>
<br>(A) to cease compliance with any provisions of any rule or regulation which the Board declares under this subsection to be invalid on its face; and
<br>
<br>(B) to correct any invalid implementation by the agency of any provision of any rule or regulation which the Board declares under this subsection to have been invalidly implemented by the agency.
<br>
<br>(g) The Board may delegate the performance of any of its administrative functions under this title to any employee of the Board.
<br>
<br>(h) The Board shall have the authority to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions. The Board shall not issue advisory opinions. All regulations of the Board shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>(i) Except as provided in section 518 of title 28, relating to litigation before the Supreme Court, attorneys designated by the Chairman of the Board may appear for the Board, and represent the Board, in any civil action brought in connection with any function carried out by the Board pursuant to this title or as otherwise authorized by law.
<br>
<br>(j) The Chairman of the Board may appoint such personnel as may be necessary to perform the functions of the Board. Any appointment made under this subsection shall comply with the provisions of this title, except that such appointment shall not be subject to the approval or supervision of the Office of Personnel Management or the Executive Office of the President (other than approval required under section 3324 or subchapter VIII of chapter 33).
<br>
<br>(k) The Board shall prepare and submit to the President, and, at the same time, to the appropriate committees of Congress, an annual budget of the expenses and other items relating to the Board which shall, as revised, be included as a separate item in the budget required to be transmitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31.
<br>
<br>(l) The Board shall submit to the President, and, at the same time, to each House of the Congress, any legislative recommendations of the Board relating to any of its functions under this title.
<br>
<br>(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the agency where the prevailing party was employed or had applied for employment at the time of the events giving rise to the case of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.
<br>
<br>(2) If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party of a case arising under section 1215 and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) of this title, the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e–5(k)).
<br>
<br>(n) The Board may accept and use gifts and donations of property and services to carry out the duties of the Board.
