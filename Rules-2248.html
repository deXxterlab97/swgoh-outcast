<br>(2) require the appropriate State election official to send notice to each applicant of the disposition of the application;

<br>
<br>(A) has not either notified the applicable registrar (in person or in writing) or responded during the period described in subparagraph (B) to the notice sent by the applicable registrar; and then
<br>
<br>(B) has not voted or appeared to vote in 2 or more consecutive general elections for Federal office.
<br>(c) Voter removal programs
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) the registrant has moved to a different residence address not in the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar uses the notice procedure described in subsection (d)(2) to confirm the change of address.

<br>(i) the removal of names from official lists of voters on a basis described in paragraph (3)(A) or (B) or (4)(A) of subsection (a); or
<br>
<br>(ii) correction of registration records pursuant to this chapter.
<br>(d) Removal of names from voting rolls
<br>
<br>(1) A State shall not remove the name of a registrant from the official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office on the ground that the registrant has changed residence unless the registrant—
<br>
<br>(A) confirms in writing that the registrant has changed residence to a place outside the registrar's jurisdiction in which the registrant is registered; or
<br>
<br>(B)(i) has failed to respond to a notice described in paragraph (2); and

<br>
<br>(2) A notice is described in this paragraph if it is a postage prepaid and pre-addressed return card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the registrant may state his or her current address, together with a notice to the following effect:
<br>
<br>(A) If the registrant did not change his or her residence, or changed residence but remained in the registrar's jurisdiction, the registrant should return the card not later than the time provided for mail registration under subsection (a)(1)(B). If the card is not returned, affirmation or confirmation of the registrant's address may be required before the registrant is permitted to vote in a Federal election during the period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for Federal office that occurs after the date of the notice, and if the registrant does not vote in an election during that period the registrant's name will be removed from the list of eligible voters.

<br>
<br>(2)(A) A registrant who has moved from an address in the area covered by one polling place to an address in an area covered by a second polling place within the same registrar's jurisdiction and the same congressional district and who has failed to notify the registrar of the change of address prior to the date of an election, at the option of the registrant—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be permitted to correct the voting records and vote at the registrant's former polling place, upon oral or written affirmation by the registrant of the new address before an election official at that polling place; or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) shall be permitted to correct the voting records and vote at a central location within the same registrar's jurisdiction designated by the registrar where a list of eligible voters is maintained, upon written affirmation by the registrant of the new address on a standard form provided by the registrar at the central location; or

<br>(II) shall be permitted to correct the voting records for purposes of voting in future elections at the appropriate polling place for the current address and, if permitted by State law, shall be permitted to vote in the present election, upon confirmation by the registrant of the new address by such means as are required by law.
<br>
<br>(B) If State law permits the registrant to vote in the current election upon oral or written affirmation by the registrant of the new address at a polling place described in subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii)(II), voting at the other locations described in subparagraph (A) need not be provided as options.
<br>

<br>(f) Change of voting address within a jurisdiction
<br>
<br>In the case of a change of address, for voting purposes, of a registrant to another address within the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar shall correct the voting registration list accordingly, and the registrant's name may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters by reason of such a change of address except as provided in subsection (d).

<br>
<br>Not later than 45 days after October 29, 2002, the Administrator of General Services (in this subchapter referred to as the "Administrator") shall establish a program under which the Administrator shall make a payment to each State in which the chief executive officer of the State, or designee, in consultation and coordination with the chief State election official, notifies the Administrator not later than 6 months after October 29, 2002, that the State intends to use the payment in accordance with this section.

<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>A State may not use the funds provided under a payment made under this section—
<br>
<br>(A) to pay costs associated with any litigation, except to the extent that such costs otherwise constitute permitted uses of a payment under this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) for the payment of any judgment.
<br>(c) Use of funds to be consistent with other laws and requirements
<br>
<br>In order to receive a payment under the program under this section, the State shall provide the Administrator with certifications that—
<br>
<br>(1) the State will use the funds provided under the payment in a manner that is consistent with each of the laws described in section 21145 of this title, as such laws relate to the provisions of this chapter; and

<br>
<br>(A) the aggregate amount made available for payments under this section minus the total of all of the minimum payment amounts determined under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(B) the voting age population proportion for the State (as defined in paragraph (4)).
<br>(4) Voting age population proportion defined
<br>
<br>The term "voting age population proportion" means, with respect to a State, the amount equal to the quotient of—

<br>§20902. Replacement of punch card or lever voting machines
<br>(a) Establishment of program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 45 days after October 29, 2002, the Administrator shall establish a program under which the Administrator shall make a payment to each State eligible under subsection (b) in which a precinct within that State used a punch card voting system or a lever voting system to administer the regularly scheduled general election for Federal office held in November 2000 (in this section referred to as a "qualifying precinct").
<br>(2) Use of funds
<br>
<br>A State shall use the funds provided under a payment under this section (either directly or as reimbursement, including as reimbursement for costs incurred on or after January 1, 2001, under multiyear contracts) to replace punch card voting systems or lever voting systems (as the case may be) in qualifying precincts within that State with a voting system (by purchase, lease, or such other arrangement as may be appropriate) that—
<br>
<br>(A) does not use punch cards or levers;
<br>
<br>(B) is not inconsistent with the requirements of the laws described in section 21145 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(C) meets the requirements of section 21081 of this title.
<br>(3) Deadline
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a State receiving a payment under the program under this section shall ensure that all of the punch card voting systems or lever voting systems in the qualifying precincts within that State have been replaced in time for the regularly scheduled general election for Federal office to be held in November 2004.
<br>(B) Waiver
<br>
<br>If a State certifies to the Administrator not later than January 1, 2004, that the State will not meet the deadline described in subparagraph (A) for good cause and includes in the certification the reasons for the failure to meet such deadline, the State shall ensure that all of the punch card voting systems or lever voting systems in the qualifying precincts within that State will be replaced in time for the first election for Federal office held after November 1, 2010.
<br>(b) Eligibility
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A State is eligible to receive a payment under the program under this section if it submits to the Administrator a notice not later than the date that is 6 months after October 29, 2002 (in such form as the Administrator may require) that contains—
<br>
<br>(A) certifications that the State will use the payment (either directly or as reimbursement, including as reimbursement for costs incurred on or after January 1, 2001, under multiyear contracts) to replace punch card voting systems or lever voting systems (as the case may be) in the qualifying precincts within the State by the deadline described in subsection (a)(3);
<br>
<br>(B) certifications that the State will continue to comply with the laws described in section 21145 of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) certifications that the replacement voting systems will meet the requirements of section 21081 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(D) such other information and certifications as the Administrator may require which are necessary for the administration of the program.
<br>(2) Compliance of States that require changes to State law
<br>
<br>In the case of a State that requires State legislation to carry out an activity covered by any certification submitted under this subsection, the State shall be permitted to make the certification notwithstanding that the legislation has not been enacted at the time the certification is submitted and such State shall submit an additional certification once such legislation is enacted.
<br>(c) Amount of payment
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2) and section 20903(b) of this title, the amount of payment made to a State under the program under this section shall be equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(A) the number of the qualifying precincts within the State; and
<br>
<br>(B) $4,000.
<br>(2) Reduction
<br>
<br>If the amount of funds appropriated pursuant to the authority of section 20904(a)(2) of this title is insufficient to ensure that each State receives the amount of payment calculated under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall reduce the amount specified in paragraph (1)(B) to ensure that the entire amount appropriated under such section is distributed to the States.
<br>(d) Repayment of funds for failure to meet deadlines
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a State receiving funds under the program under this section fails to meet the deadline applicable to the State under subsection (a)(3), the State shall pay to the Administrator an amount equal to the noncompliant precinct percentage of the amount of the funds provided to the State under the program.
<br>(2) Noncompliant precinct percentage defined
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "noncompliant precinct percentage" means, with respect to a State, the amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to the quotient of—
<br>
