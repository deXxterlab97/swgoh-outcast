<br>
<br>liquidation shall be suspended at the cash deposit rate in effect on the date described in subparagraph (A) or (B) (whichever is applicable).

<br>(C) Special rule to permit administrative flexibility
<br>
<br>In the case of requests for investigations received under this section within 1 year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, the Commission may, after consulting with the administering authority, initiate its investigations in a manner that results in determinations being made in all such investigations during the 4-year period beginning on such date.
<br>(2) Net countervailable subsidy; nature of subsidy
<br>(A) Net countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order which is the subject of the investigation is revoked. The administering authority normally shall choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title. If the Commission considers the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy in making its determination under this section, the Commission shall use the net countervailable subsidy provided by the administering authority.
<br>(B) Nature of subsidy
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall inform the Commission of, and the Commission, in making its determination under this section, shall consider, the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or Article 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.

<br>
<br>Upon being notified by the Commission that it has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1)—

<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Upon being notified by the Commission that it has made a negative determination under subsection (a)(1), the administering authority shall revoke the countervailing duty order, and shall refund, with interest, any estimated countervailing duties collected during the period liquidation was suspended pursuant to subsection (a)(4).
<br>(ii) Limitation on negative determination
<br>
<br>A determination by the Commission that revocation of the order is not likely to result in material injury to an industry by reason of imports of the subject merchandise shall not be based, in whole or in part, on any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States that were specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.
<br>(4) Countervailing duty orders with respect to which no request for injury investigation is made
<br>
<br>If, with respect to a countervailing duty order described in subsection (a), a request for an investigation is not made within the time required by subsection (a)(3), the Commission shall notify the administering authority that a negative determination has been made under subsection (a) and the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) shall apply with respect to the order.
<br>(c) Pending and suspended countervailing duty investigations

<br>
<br>(1) in the case of an investigation in progress, make a final determination under section 1671d(b) of this title within 75 days after the date of an affirmative final determination, if any, by the administering authority,
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a suspended investigation to which section 1671c(i)(1)(B) of this title applies, make a final determination under section 1671d(b) of this title within 120 days after receiving notice from the administering authority of the resumption of the investigation pursuant to section 1671c(i) of this title, or within 45 days after the date of an affirmative final determination, if any, by the administering authority, whichever is later, or
<br>
<br>(3) in the case of a suspended investigation to which section 1671c(i)(1)(C) of this title applies, treat the countervailing duty order issued pursuant to such section as if it were—
<br>
<br>(A) an order issued under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) for purposes of subsection (a)(3); and
<br>
<br>(B) an order issued under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i) for purposes of subsection (a)(4).

<br>(e) Request for simultaneous expedited review under section 1675(c)
<br>(1) General rule
<br>(A) Requests for reviews
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1675(c)(6)(A) of this title and except as provided in subparagraph (B), an interested party may request a review of an order under section 1675(c) of this title at the same time the party requests an investigation under subsection (a), if the order involves the same or comparable subject merchandise. Upon receipt of such request, the administering authority, after consulting with the Commission, shall initiate a review of the order under section 1675(c) of this title. The Commission shall combine such review with the investigation under this section.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines that the interested party who requested an investigation under this section is a related party or an importer within the meaning of section 1677(4)(B) of this title, the administering authority may decline a request by such party to initiate a review of an order under section 1675(c) of this title which involves the same or comparable subject merchandise.
<br>(2) Cumulation
<br>
<br>If a review under section 1675(c) of this title is initiated under paragraph (1), such review shall be treated as having been initiated on the same day as the investigation under this section, and the Commission may, in accordance with section 1677(7)(G) of this title, cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which such investigations are treated as initiated on the same day.
<br>(3) Time and procedure for Commission determination
<br>
<br>The Commission shall render its determination in the investigation conducted under this section at the same time as the Commission's determination is made in the review under section 1675(c) of this title that is initiated pursuant to this subsection. The Commission shall in all other respects apply the procedures and standards set forth in section 1675(c) of this title to such section 1675(c) of this title reviews.

<br>Part IV—General Provisions
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>The designation "Part IV" was in the original "Subtitle D" and was editorially changed in order to conform the numbering format of this subtitle to the usages employed in the codification of the remainder of the Tariff Act of 1930 as originally enacted.
<br>§1677. Definitions; special rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subtitle—
<br>(1) Administering authority
<br>
<br>The term "administering authority" means the Secretary of Commerce, or any other officer of the United States to whom the responsibility for carrying out the duties of the administering authority under this subtitle are transferred by law.
<br>(2) Commission
<br>
<br>The term "Commission" means the United States International Trade Commission.
<br>(3) Country
<br>
<br>The term "country" means a foreign country, a political subdivision, dependent territory, or possession of a foreign country, and, except for the purpose of antidumping proceedings, may include an association of 2 or more foreign countries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessions of countries into a customs union outside the United States.
<br>(4) Industry
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "industry" means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.
<br>(B) Related parties
<br>
<br>(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if—
<br>
<br>(I) the producer directly or indirectly controls the exporter or importer,
<br>
<br>(II) the exporter or importer directly or indirectly controls the producer,
<br>
<br>(III) a third party directly or indirectly controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or
<br>
<br>(IV) the producer and the exporter or importer directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the producer to act differently than a nonrelated producer.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, a party shall be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.
<br>(C) Regional industries
<br>
<br>In appropriate circumstances, the United States, for a particular product market, may be divided into 2 or more markets and the producers within each market may be treated as if they were a separate industry if—
<br>
<br>(i) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the domestic like product in question in that market, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the demand in that market is not supplied, to any substantial degree, by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the United States.
<br>
<br>In such appropriate circumstances, material injury, the threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry may be found to exist with respect to an industry even if the domestic industry as a whole, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of that product, is not injured, if there is a concentration of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy into such an isolated market and if the producers of all, or almost all, of the production within that market are being materially injured or threatened by material injury, or if the establishment of an industry is being materially retarded, by reason of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy. The term "regional industry" means the domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry under this subparagraph.
<br>(D) Product lines
<br>
<br>The effect of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed in relation to the United States production of a domestic like product if available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as the production process or the producer's profits. If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.
<br>(E) Industry producing processed agricultural products
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clause (v), in an investigation involving a processed agricultural product produced from any raw agricultural product, the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product may be considered part of the industry producing the processed product if—
<br>
<br>(I) the processed agricultural product is produced from the raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production; and
<br>
<br>(II) there is a substantial coincidence of economic interest between the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product and the processors of the processed agricultural product based upon relevant economic factors, which may, in the discretion of the Commission, include price, added market value, or other economic interrelationships (regardless of whether such coincidence of economic interest is based upon any legal relationship).
<br>(ii) Processing
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the processed agricultural product shall be considered to be processed from a raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production if—
<br>
<br>(I) the raw agricultural product is substantially or completely devoted to the production of the processed agricultural product; and
<br>
<br>(II) the processed agricultural product is produced substantially or completely from the raw product.
<br>(iii) Relevant economic factors
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (i)(II), in addition to such other factors it considers relevant to the question of coincidence of economic interest, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(I) if price is taken into account, consider the degree of correlation between the price of the raw agricultural product and the price of the processed agricultural product; and
<br>
<br>(II) if added market value is taken into account, consider whether the value of the raw agricultural product constitutes a significant percentage of the value of the processed agricultural product.
<br>(iv) Raw agricultural product
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "raw agricultural product" means any farm or fishery product.
<br>(v) Termination of this subparagraph
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall cease to have effect if the United States Trade Representative notifies the administering authority and the Commission that the application of this subparagraph is inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States.
<br>(5) Countervailable subsidy
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).
<br>(B) Subsidy described
<br>
<br>A subsidy is described in this paragraph in the case in which an authority—
<br>
<br>(i) provides a financial contribution,
<br>
<br>(ii) provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or
<br>
<br>(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,
<br>
<br>to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term "authority" means a government of a country or any public entity within the territory of the country.
<br>(C) Other factors
<br>
<br>The determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a subsidy exists under this paragraph.
<br>(D) Financial contribution
<br>
<br>The term "financial contribution" means—
<br>
<br>(i) the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,
<br>
<br>(ii) foregoing or not collecting revenue that is otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions from taxable income,
<br>
<br>(iii) providing goods or services, other than general infrastructure, or
<br>
<br>(iv) purchasing goods.
<br>(E) Benefit conferred
<br>
<br>A benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, including—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of an equity infusion, if the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors, including the practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the country in which the equity infusion is made,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,
<br>
<br>(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and
<br>
<br>(iv) in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (iv), the adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for the good or service being provided or the goods being purchased in the country which is subject to the investigation or review. Prevailing market conditions include price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other conditions of purchase or sale.
<br>(F) Change in ownership
<br>
<br>A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm's length transaction.
<br>(5A) Specificity
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).
<br>(B) Export subsidy
<br>
<br>An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.
<br>(C) Import substitution subsidy
<br>
<br>An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.
<br>(D) Domestic subsidy
<br>
<br>In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:
<br>
<br>(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.
<br>
<br>(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if—
<br>
<br>(I) eligibility is automatic,
<br>
<br>(II) the criteria or conditions for eligibility are strictly followed, and
<br>
<br>(III) the criteria or conditions are clearly set forth in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.
<br>
<br> For purposes of this clause, the term "objective criteria or conditions" means criteria or conditions that are neutral and that do not favor one enterprise or industry over another.
<br>
<br>(iii) Where there are reasons to believe that a subsidy may be specific as a matter of fact, the subsidy is specific if one or more of the following factors exist:
<br>
<br>(I) The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are limited in number.
<br>
<br>(II) An enterprise or industry is a predominant user of the subsidy.
<br>
<br>(III) An enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.
<br>
<br>(IV) The manner in which the authority providing the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or industry is favored over others.
<br>
<br> In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall take into account the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which the subsidy program has been in operation.
<br>
<br>(iv) Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or industry located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or industries.
<br>(5B) Categories of noncountervailable subsidies
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines in an investigation under part I of this subtitle or a review under part III of this subtitle that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.
<br>(B) Research subsidy
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Except for a subsidy provided on the manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to—
<br>
<br>(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,
<br>
<br>(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the research activity,
<br>
<br>(III) the costs of consultancy and equivalent services used exclusively for the research activity, including costs for bought-in research, technical knowledge, and patents,
<br>
<br>(IV) additional overhead costs incurred directly as a result of the research activity, and
<br>
<br>(V) other operating costs (such as materials and supplies) incurred directly as a result of the research activity.
<br>(ii) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph—
<br>(I) Industrial research
<br>
<br>The term "industrial research" means planned search or critical investigation aimed at the discovery of new knowledge, with the objective that such knowledge may be useful in developing new products, processes, or services, or in bringing about a significant improvement to existing products, processes, or services.
<br>(II) Precompetitive development activity
<br>
<br>The term "precompetitive development activity" means the translation of industrial research findings into a plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or improved products, processes, or services, whether intended for sale or use, including the creation of a first prototype that would not be capable of commercial use. The term also may include the conceptual formulation and design of products, processes, or services alternatives and initial demonstration or pilot projects, if these same projects cannot be converted or used for industrial application or commercial exploitation. The term does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or other ongoing operations even if those alterations may represent improvements.
<br>(iii) Calculation rules
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a research activity that spans both industrial research and precompetitive development activity, the allowable level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i).
<br>(II) Total eligible costs
<br>
<br>The allowable level of a noncountervailable subsidy described in clause (i) shall be based on the total eligible costs incurred over the duration of a particular project.
<br>(C) Subsidy to disadvantaged regions
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:
<br>
<br>(I) Each region identified as disadvantaged within the territory of a country is a clearly designated, contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity.
<br>
<br>(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.
<br>
<br>(III) The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.
<br>
<br>(IV) Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).
<br>(ii) Measurement of economic development
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:
<br>
<br>(I) Per capita income, household per capita income, or per capita gross domestic product that does not exceed 85 percent of the average for the country subject to investigation or review.
<br>
<br>(II) An unemployment rate that is at least 110 percent of the average unemployment rate for the country subject to investigation or review.
<br>
<br> The measurement of economic development shall cover a 3-year period, but may be a composite measurement and may include factors other than those set forth in this clause.
<br>(iii) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph—
<br>(I) General framework of regional development
<br>
<br>The term "general framework of regional development" means that the regional subsidy programs are part of an internally consistent and generally applicable regional development policy, and that regional development subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical points having no, or virtually no, influence on the development of a region.
<br>(II) Neutral and objective criteria
<br>
<br>The term "neutral and objective criteria" means criteria that do not favor certain regions beyond what is appropriate for the elimination or reduction of regional disparities within the framework of the regional development policy.
<br>(D) Subsidy for adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy—
<br>
<br>(I) is a one-time nonrecurring measure,
<br>
<br>(II) is limited to 20 percent of the cost of adaptation,
<br>
<br>(III) does not cover the cost of replacing and operating the subsidized investment, a cost that must be fully borne by the recipient,
<br>
<br>(IV) is directly linked and proportionate to the recipient's planned reduction of nuisances and pollution, and does not cover any manufacturing cost savings that may be achieved, and
<br>
<br>(V) is available to all persons that can adopt the new equipment or production processes.
<br>(ii) Existing facilities
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "existing facilities" means facilities that have been in operation for at least 2 years before the date on which the new environmental requirements are imposed.
<br>(E) Notified subsidy program
<br>(i) General rule
<br>
<br>If a subsidy is provided pursuant to a program that has been notified in accordance with Article 8.3 of the Subsidies Agreement, the subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable and shall not be subject to investigation or review under this subtitle.
<br>(ii) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (i), a subsidy shall be treated as countervailable if—
<br>
<br>(I) the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that a determination has been made pursuant to Article 8.4 or 8.5 of the Subsidies Agreement that the subsidy, or the program pursuant to which the subsidy was provided, does not satisfy the conditions and criteria of Article 8.2 of the Subsidies Agreement; and
<br>
<br>(II) the subsidy is specific within the meaning of paragraph (5A).
<br>(F) Certain subsidies on agricultural products
<br>
<br>Domestic support measures that are provided with respect to products listed in Annex 1 to the Agreement on Agriculture, and that the administering authority determines conform fully to the provisions of Annex 2 to that Agreement, shall be treated as noncountervailable. Upon request by the administering authority, the Trade Representative shall provide advice regarding the interpretation and application of Annex 2.
<br>(G) Provisional application
<br>
<br>(i) Subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) shall not apply on or after the first day of the month that is 66 months after the WTO Agreement enters into force, unless the provisions of such subparagraphs are extended pursuant to section 3572(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>(ii) Subparagraph (F) shall not apply to imports from a WTO member country at the end of the 9-year period beginning on January 1, 1995. The Trade Representative shall determine the precise termination date for each WTO member country in accordance with paragraph (i) of Article 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and such date shall be notified to the administering authority.
<br>(6) Net countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>For the purpose of determining the net countervailable subsidy, the administering authority may subtract from the gross countervailable subsidy the amount of—
<br>
<br>(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the countervailable subsidy,
<br>
<br>(B) any loss in the value of the countervailable subsidy resulting from its deferred receipt, if the deferral is mandated by Government order, and
<br>
<br>(C) export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.
<br>(7) Material injury
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "material injury" means harm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.
<br>(B) Volume and consequent impact
<br>
<br>In making determinations under sections 1671b(a), 1671d(b), 1673b(a), and 1673d(b) of this title, the Commission, in each case—
<br>
<br>(i) shall consider—
<br>
<br>(I) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise,
<br>
<br>(II) the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United States for domestic like products, and
<br>
<br>(III) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of domestic like products, but only in the context of production operations within the United States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.
<br>
<br>In the notification required under section 1671d(d) or 1673d(d) of this title, as the case may be, the Commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause (i), and identify each factor considered under clause (ii) and explain in full its relevance to the determination.
<br>(C) Evaluation of relevant factors
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (B)—
<br>(i) Volume
<br>
<br>In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.
<br>(ii) Price
<br>
<br>In evaluating the effect of imports of such merchandise on prices, the Commission shall consider whether—
<br>
<br>(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and
<br>
<br>(II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.
<br>(iii) Impact on affected domestic industry
<br>
<br>In examining the impact required to be considered under subparagraph (B)(i)(III), the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—
<br>
<br>(I) actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, gross profits, operating profits, net profits, ability to service debt, productivity, return on investments, return on assets, and utilization of capacity,
<br>
<br>(II) factors affecting domestic prices,
<br>
<br>(III) actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment,
<br>
<br>(IV) actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and
<br>
<br>(V) in a proceeding under part II of this subtitle, the magnitude of the margin of dumping.
<br>
<br> The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this clause within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.
<br>(iv) Captive production
<br>
<br>If domestic producers internally transfer significant production of the domestic like product for the production of a downstream article and sell significant production of the domestic like product in the merchant market, and the Commission finds that—
<br>
<br>(I) the domestic like product produced that is internally transferred for processing into that downstream article does not enter the merchant market for the domestic like product, and
<br>
<br>(II) the domestic like product is the predominant material input in the production of that downstream article,
<br>
<br> then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.
<br>(D) Special rules for agricultural products
<br>
<br>(i) The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.
<br>
<br>(ii) In the case of agricultural products, the Commission shall consider any increased burden on government income or price support programs.
<br>(E) Special rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>(i) Nature of countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>In determining whether there is a threat of material injury, the Commission shall consider information provided to it by the administering authority regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy granted by a foreign country (particularly whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and the effects likely to be caused by the countervailable subsidy.
<br>(ii) Standard for determination
<br>
<br>The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subparagraph (C) or (D) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination by the Commission of material injury.
<br>(F) Threat of material injury
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors—
<br>
<br>(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase,
<br>
<br>(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,
<br>
<br>(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,
<br>
<br>(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,
<br>
<br>(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,
<br>
<br>(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,
<br>
<br>(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),
<br>
<br>(VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and
<br>
<br>(IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).
<br>(ii) Basis for determination
<br>
<br>The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.
<br>(iii) Effect of dumping in third-country markets
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.
<br>(II) WTO member market
<br>
<br>For purposes of this clause, the term "WTO member market" means the market of any country which is a WTO member.
<br>(III) European Communities
<br>
<br>For purposes of this clause, the European Communities shall be treated as a foreign country.
<br>(G) Cumulation for determining material injury
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (C), and subject to clause (ii), the Commission shall cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which—
<br>
<br>(I) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title on the same day,
<br>
<br>(II) investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day, or
<br>
<br>(III) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title and investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day,
<br>
<br> if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.
<br>(ii) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports under clause (i)—
<br>
<br>(I) with respect to which the administering authority has made a preliminary negative determination, unless the administering authority subsequently made a final affirmative determination with respect to those imports before the Commission's final determination is made;
<br>
<br>(II) from any country with respect to which the investigation has been terminated;
<br>
<br>(III) from any country designated as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) for purposes of making a determination with respect to that country, except that the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from such country may be cumulatively assessed with imports of the subject merchandise from any other country designated as such a beneficiary country to the extent permitted by clause (i); or
<br>
<br>(IV) from any country that is a party to an agreement with the United States establishing a free trade area, which entered into force and effect before January 1, 1987, unless the Commission determines that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from that country.
<br>(iii) Records in final investigations
<br>
<br>In each final determination in which it cumulatively assesses the volume and effect of imports under clause (i), the Commission shall make its determinations based on the record compiled in the first investigation in which it makes a final determination, except that when the administering authority issues its final determination in a subsequently completed investigation, the Commission shall permit the parties in the subsequent investigation to submit comments concerning the significance of the administering authority's final determination, and shall include such comments and the administering authority's final determination in the record for the subsequent investigation.
<br>(iv) Regional industry determinations
<br>
<br>In an investigation which involves a regional industry, and in which the Commission decides that the volume and effect of imports should be cumulatively assessed under this subparagraph, such assessment shall be based upon the volume and effect of imports into the region or regions determined by the Commission. The provisions of clause (iii) shall apply to such investigations.
<br>(H) Cumulation for determining threat of material injury
<br>
<br>To the extent practicable and subject to subparagraph (G)(ii), for purposes of clause (i)(III) and (IV) of subparagraph (F), the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and price effects of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which—
<br>
<br>(i) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title on the same day,
<br>
<br>(ii) investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day, or
<br>
<br>(iii) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title and investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day,
<br>
<br>if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.
<br>(I) Consideration of post-petition information
<br>
<br>The Commission shall consider whether any change in the volume, price effects, or impact of imports of the subject merchandise since the filing of the petition in an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle is related to the pendency of the investigation and, if so, the Commission may reduce the weight accorded to the data for the period after the filing of the petition in making its determination of material injury, threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States.
<br>(J) Effect of profitability
<br>
<br>The Commission may not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to an industry in the United States merely because that industry is profitable or because the performance of that industry has recently improved.
<br>(8) Subsidies Agreement; Agreement on Agriculture
<br>(A) Subsidies Agreement
<br>
<br>The term "Subsidies Agreement" means the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures referred to in section 3511(d)(12) of this title.
<br>(B) Agreement on Agriculture
<br>
<br>The term "Agreement on Agriculture" means the Agreement on Agriculture referred to in section 3511(d)(2) of this title.
<br>(9) Interested party
<br>
<br>The term "interested party" means—
<br>
<br>(A) a foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or the United States importer, of subject merchandise or a trade or business association a majority of the members of which are producers, exporters, or importers of such merchandise,
<br>
<br>(B) the government of a country in which such merchandise is produced or manufactured or from which such merchandise is exported,
<br>
<br>(C) a manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a domestic like product,
<br>
<br>(D) a certified union or recognized union or group of workers which is representative of an industry engaged in the manufacture, production, or wholesale in the United States of a domestic like product,
<br>
<br>(E) a trade or business association a majority of whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale a domestic like product in the United States,
<br>
<br>(F) an association, a majority of whose members is composed of interested parties described in subparagraph (C), (D), or (E) with respect to a domestic like product, and
<br>
<br>(G) in any investigation under this subtitle involving an industry engaged in producing a processed agricultural product, as defined in paragraph (4)(E), a coalition or trade association which is representative of either—
<br>
<br>(i) processors,
<br>
<br>(ii) processors and producers, or
<br>
<br>(iii) processors and growers,
<br>
<br>but this subparagraph shall cease to have effect if the United States Trade Representative notifies the administering authority and the Commission that the application of this subparagraph is inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States.
<br>(10) Domestic like product
<br>
<br>The term "domestic like product" means a product which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation under this subtitle.

<br>"(I) the volume and market share of the imports are negligible,
<br>
<br>"(II) sales transactions involving the imports are isolated and sporadic, and
<br>
<br>"(III) the domestic market for the like product is price sensitive by reason of the nature of the product, so that a small quantity of imports can result in price suppression or depression.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this clause, the Commission may treat as negligible and having no discernable adverse impact on the domestic industry imports that are the product of any country that is a party to a free trade area agreement with the United States which entered into force and effect before January 1, 1987, if the Commission determines that the domestic industry is not being materially injured by reason of such imports."

<br>
<br>"(I) compete with each other, and with like products of the domestic industry, in the United States market, and
<br>
<br>"(II) are subject to any investigation under section 1303, 1671, or 1673 of this title."
