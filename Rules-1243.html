<br>Section was enacted as part of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2005, and also as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, and not as part of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 which comprises this chapter.
<br>SUBCHAPTER II—SUPPORT FOR MULTILATERAL FUNDS, PROGRAMS, AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
<br>§7621. Sense of Congress on public-private partnerships
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Innovative partnerships between governments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corporations, faith-based and community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) have proliferated in recent years, particularly in the area of health.
<br>
<br>(2) Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are essential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries.
<br>
<br>(3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone.
<br>
<br>(4) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases around the globe.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private partnerships should be a priority element of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and
<br>
<br>(2) the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sector to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.

<br>§7622. Participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
<br>(a) Findings; sense of Congress
<br>(1) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(B) The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which—
<br>
<br>(i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and
<br>
<br>(ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.
<br>
<br>(C) The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs—
<br>
<br>(i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and
<br>
<br>(ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.
<br>
<br>(D) The United States Government—
<br>
<br>(i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;
<br>
<br>(ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and
<br>
<br>(iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.
<br>(2) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;
<br>
<br>(B) the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by—
<br>
<br>(i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;
<br>
<br>(ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and
<br>
<br>(iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;
<br>
<br>(C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;
<br>
<br>(D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;
<br>
<br>(E) the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant's fiscal cycle; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;
<br>
<br>(F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;
<br>
<br>(G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;
<br>
<br>(H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and
<br>
<br>(I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the "Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria" or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.
<br>(b) Authority for United States participation
<br>(1) United States participation
<br>
<br>The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.
<br>(2) Privileges and immunities
<br>
<br>The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of section 288 of this title.
<br>(3) Statement of policy
<br>
<br>The United States Government regards the imposition by recipient countries of taxes or tariffs on goods or services provided by the Global Fund, which are supported through public and private donations, including the substantial contribution of the American people, as inappropriate and inconsistent with standards of good governance. The Global AIDS Coordinator or other representatives of the United States Government shall work with the Global Fund to dissuade governments from imposing such duties, tariffs, or taxes.
<br>(c) Reports to Congress
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after May 27, 2003, and annually thereafter for the duration of the Global Fund, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions (including donations from the private sector) received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and the mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process.
<br>(d) United States financial participation
<br>(1) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>In addition to any other funds authorized to be appropriated for bilateral or multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria programs, of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President up to $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2009,,1 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2013, for contributions to the Global Fund.

<br>

<br>
<br>(v) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the President determines that the salary of any individual employed by the Global Fund exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States (as determined under section 104 of title 3) for that fiscal year, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which the salary of each such individual exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Any amount made available that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be contributed to the Global Fund as soon as practicable, subject to subparagraph (A)(i), after additional contributions to the Global Fund are made from other sources.
<br>
<br>(ii) Any amount made available that is withheld by reason of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) is authorized to be made available to carry out section 2151b–2 of this title or section 2151b–3 or 2151b–4 of this title.

<br>

In recognition of the impact of malnutrition as a clinical health issue for many persons living with HIV/AIDS that is often associated with health and economic impacts on these individuals and their families, the Global AIDS Coordinator and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall—
<br>
<br>(A) follow World Health Organization guidelines for HIV/AIDS food and nutrition services;
<br>
<br>(B) integrate nutrition programs with HIV/AIDS activities through effective linkages among the health, agricultural, and livelihood sectors and establish additional services in circumstances in which referrals are inadequate or impossible;
<br>
<br>(C) provide, as a component of care and treatment programs for persons with HIV/AIDS, food and nutritional support to individuals infected with, and affected by, HIV/AIDS who meet established criteria for nutritional support (including clinically malnourished children and adults, and pregnant and lactating women in programs in need of supplemental support), including—
<br>
<br>(i) anthropometric and dietary assessment;
<br>
<br>(ii) counseling; and
<br>
<br>(iii) therapeutic and supplementary feeding;
<br>
<br>(D) provide food and nutritional support for children affected by HIV/AIDS and to communities and households caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS; and
<br>
<br>(E) in communities where HIV/AIDS and food insecurity are highly prevalent, support programs to address these often intersecting health problems through community-based assistance programs, with an emphasis on sustainable approaches.
<br>(2) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out this subsection.
<br>(d) Eligibility for assistance
<br>
<br>An organization, including a faith-based organization, that is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151b–2], under this chapter, or under any amendment made by this chapter or by the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, or care—
<br>
<br>(1) shall not be required, as a condition of receiving such assistance—
<br>
<br>(A) to endorse or utilize a multisectoral or comprehensive approach to combating HIV/AIDS; or
<br>
<br>(B) to endorse, utilize, make a referral to, become integrated with, or otherwise participate in any program or activity to which the organization has a religious or moral objection; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall not be discriminated against in the solicitation or issuance of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under such provisions of law for refusing to meet any requirement described in paragraph (1).
<br>(e) Limitation
<br>
<br>No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to preclude the provision to individuals of palliative care, treatment, or post-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis, and necessary pharmaceuticals and commodities, including test kits, condoms, and, when proven effective, microbicides.
<br>(f) Limitation
<br>
<br>No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, except that this subsection shall not apply to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or to any United Nations agency.
<br>(g) Sense of Congress relating to food assistance for individuals living with HIV/AIDS
<br>(1) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The United States provides more than 60 percent of all food assistance worldwide.
<br>
<br>(B) According to the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations agencies, food insecurity of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS is a major problem in countries with large populations of such individuals, particularly in African countries.
<br>
<br>(C) Although the United States is willing to provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of benign genetic modifications to the foods.
<br>
<br>(D) Healthy and nutritious foods for individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS are an important complement to HIV/AIDS medicines for such individuals.
<br>
<br>(E) Individuals infected with HIV have higher nutritional requirements than individuals who are not infected with HIV, particularly with respect to the need for protein. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.
<br>(2) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food assistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals.
