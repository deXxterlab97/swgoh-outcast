<br>§1782. Bureau of Land Management Wilderness Study
<br>(a) Lands subject to review and designation as wilderness
<br>
<br>Within fifteen years after October 21, 1976, the Secretary shall review those roadless areas of five thousand acres or more and roadless islands of the public lands, identified during the inventory required by section 1711(a) of this title as having wilderness characteristics described in the Wilderness Act of September 3, 1964 (78 Stat. 890; 16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and shall from time to time report to the President his recommendation as to the suitability or nonsuitability of each such area or island for preservation as wilderness: Provided, That prior to any recommendations for the designation of an area as wilderness the Secretary shall cause mineral surveys to be conducted by the United States Geological Survey and the United States Bureau of Mines to determine the mineral values, if any, that may be present in such areas: Provided further, That the Secretary shall report to the President by July 1, 1980, his recommendations on those areas which the Secretary has prior to November 1, 1975, formally identified as natural or primitive areas. The review required by this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure specified in section 3(d) of the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1132(d)].
<br>(b) Presidential recommendation for designation as wilderness

A recommendation of the President for designation as wilderness shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress.
<br>(c) Status of lands during period of review and determination
<br>
<br>During the period of review of such areas and until Congress has determined otherwise, the Secretary shall continue to manage such lands according to his authority under this Act and other applicable law in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness, subject, however, to the continuation of existing mining and grazing uses and mineral leasing in the manner and degree in which the same was being conducted on October 21, 1976: Provided, That, in managing the public lands the Secretary shall by regulation or otherwise take any action required to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands and their resources or to afford environmental protection. Unless previously withdrawn from appropriation under the mining laws, such lands shall continue to be subject to such appropriation during the period of review unless withdrawn by the Secretary under the procedures of section 1714 of this title for reasons other than preservation of their wilderness character. Once an area has been designated for preservation as wilderness, the provisions of the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.] which apply to national forest wilderness areas shall apply with respect to the administration and use of such designated area, including mineral surveys required by section 4(d)(2) of the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(2)], and mineral development, access, exchange of lands, and ingress and egress for mining claimants and occupants.

<br>"(i) Effective on the date of closing for the Acquisition Lands identified in paragraph (2)(B), all lands retained by or conveyed to KNA pursuant to this section, and the subsurface interests of CIRI underlying such lands shall be automatically removed from the National Wildlife Refuge System and shall neither be considered as part of the Refuge nor subject to any laws pertaining solely to lands within the boundaries of the Refuge. The conveyance restrictions imposed by section 22(g) of ANCSA [43 U.S.C. 1621(g)] (i) shall then be ineffective and cease to apply to such interests of KNA and CIRI, and (ii) shall not be applicable to the interests received by KNA in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) or to the CIRI interests underlying them. The Secretary shall adjust the boundaries of the Refuge so as to exclude all interests in lands retained or received in exchange by KNA in accordance with this section, including both surface and subsurface, and shall also exclude all interests currently held by CIRI. On lands within the Swanson River Road East Tract, the boundary adjustment shall only include the surface estate where the subsurface estate is retained by the United States.
<br>
<br>"(ii)(I) The Secretary, KNA, and CIRI shall execute an agreement within 45 days of the date of enactment of this section [Nov. 12, 1996] which preserves CIRI's rights under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the Terms and Conditions, addresses CIRI's obligations under such paragraph, and adequately addresses management issues associated with the boundary adjustment set forth in this section and with the differing interests in land resulting from enactment of this section.
<br>
<br>"(II) In the event that no agreement is executed as provided for in subclause (I), solely for the purposes of administering CIRI's rights under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the Terms and Conditions, the Secretary and CIRI shall be deemed to have retained their respective rights and obligations with respect to CIRI's subsurface interests under the requirements of the Terms and Conditions in effect on June 18, 1996. Notwithstanding the boundary adjustments made pursuant to this section, conveyances to KNA shall be deemed to remain subject to the Secretary's and CIRI's rights and obligations under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the Terms and Conditions.
<br>
<br>"(iii) The Secretary is authorized to acquire by purchase or exchange, on a willing seller basis only, any lands retained by or conveyed to KNA. In the event that any lands owned by KNA are subsequently acquired by the United States, they shall be automatically included in the Refuge System. The laws and regulations applicable to Refuge lands shall then apply to these lands and the Secretary shall then adjust the boundaries accordingly.
<br>
<br>"(iv) Nothing in this section is intended to enlarge or diminish the authorities, rights, duties, obligations, or the property rights held by CIRI under the Terms and Conditions, or otherwise except as set forth in this section. In the event of the purchase by the United States of any lands from KNA in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the United States shall reassume from KNA the rights it previously held under the Terms and Conditions and the provisions in any patent implementing section 22(g) of ANCSA [43 U.S.C. 1621(g)] will again apply.
<br>
<br>"(v) By virtue of implementation of this section, CIRI is deemed entitled to 1,207 acres of in-lieu subsurface entitlement under section 12(a)(1) of ANCSA [43 U.S.C. 1611(a)(1)]. Such entitlement shall be fulfilled in accordance with paragraph 1(B)(2)(A) of the Terms and Conditions.

<br>
<br>"(C) Acceptance.—KNA may accept the offer made in this section by notifying the Secretary in writing of its decision within 180 days of receipt of the offer. In the event the offer is rejected, the Secretary shall notify the Committee on Resources [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.
<br>
<br>"(D) Final maps.—Not later than 120 days after the conclusion of the acquisition authorized by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall transmit a final report and maps accurately depicting the lands transferred and conveyed pursuant to this section and the acreage and legal descriptions of such lands to the Committee on Resources [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.
<br>

<br>§1801. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the demand for energy in the United States is increasing and will continue to increase for the foreseeable future;
<br>
<br>(2) domestic production of oil and gas has declined in recent years;
<br>
<br>(3) the United States has become increasingly dependent upon imports of oil from foreign nations to meet domestic energy demand;
<br>
<br>(4) increasing reliance on imported oil is not inevitable, but is rather subject to significant reduction by increasing the development of domestic sources of energy supply;
<br>
<br>(5) consumption of natural gas in the United States has greatly exceeded additions to domestic reserves in recent years;
<br>
<br>(6) technology is or can be made available which will allow significantly increased domestic production of oil and gas without undue harm or damage to the environment;
<br>
<br>(7) the Outer Continental Shelf contains significant quantities of oil and natural gas and is a vital national resource reserve which must be carefully managed so as to realize fair value, to preserve and maintain competition, and to reflect the public interest;
<br>
<br>(8) there presently exists a variety of technological, economic, environmental, administrative, and legal problems which tend to retard the development of the oil and natural gas reserves of the Outer Continental Shelf;
<br>
<br>(9) environmental and safety regulations relating to activities on the Outer Continental Shelf should be reviewed in light of current technology and information;
<br>
<br>(10) the development, processing, and distribution of the oil and gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, and the siting of related energy facilities, may cause adverse impacts on various States and local governments;
<br>
<br>(11) policies, plans, and programs developed by States and local governments in response to activities on the Outer Continental Shelf cannot anticipate and ameliorate such adverse impacts unless such States, working in close cooperation with affected local governments, are provided with timely access to information regarding activities on the Outer Continental Shelf and an opportunity to review and comment on decisions relating to such activities;
<br>
<br>(12) funds must be made available to pay for the prompt removal of any oil spilled or discharged as a result of activities on the Outer Continental Shelf and for any damages to public or private interests caused by such spills or discharges;
<br>
<br>(13) because of the possible conflicts between exploitation of the oil and gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf and other uses of the marine environment, including fish and shellfish growth and recovery, and recreational activity, the Federal Government must assume responsibility for the minimization or elimination of any conflict associated with such exploitation;
<br>
<br>(14) the oil and gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf are limited, nonrenewable resources which must be developed in a manner which takes into consideration the Nation's long-range energy needs and also assures adequate protection of the renewable resources of the Outer Continental Shelf which are a continuing and increasingly important source of food and protein to the Nation and the world; and
<br>
<br>(15) funds must be made available to pay for damage to commercial fishing vessels and gear resulting from activities involving oil and gas exploration, development, and production on the Outer Continental Shelf.

<br>§1802. Congressional declaration of purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are to—
<br>
<br>(1) establish policies and procedures for managing the oil and natural gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf which are intended to result in expedited exploration and development of the Outer Continental Shelf in order to achieve national economic and energy policy goals, assure national security, reduce dependence on foreign sources, and maintain a favorable balance of payments in world trade;
<br>
<br>(2) preserve, protect, and develop oil and natural gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf in a manner which is consistent with the need (A) to make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible, (B) to balance orderly energy resource development with protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments, (C) to insure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, and (D) to preserve and maintain free enterprise competition;
<br>
<br>(3) encourage development of new and improved technology for energy resource production which will eliminate or minimize risk of damage to the human, marine, and coastal environments;
<br>
<br>(4) provide States, and through States, local governments, which are impacted by Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration, development, and production with comprehensive assistance in order to anticipate and plan for such impact, and thereby to assure adequate protection of the human environment;
<br>
<br>(5) assure that States, and through States, local governments, have timely access to information regarding activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, and opportunity to review and comment on decisions relating to such activities, in order to anticipate, ameliorate, and plan for the impacts of such activities;
<br>
<br>(6) assure that States, and through States, local governments, which are directly affected by exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas are provided an opportunity to participate in policy and planning decisions relating to management of the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf;
<br>
<br>(7) minimize or eliminate conflicts between the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, and the recovery of other resources such as fish and shellfish;
<br>
<br>(8) establish an oilspill liability fund to pay for the prompt removal of any oil spilled or discharged as a result of activities on the Outer Continental Shelf and for any damages to public or private interests caused by such spills or discharges;
<br>
<br>(9) insure that the extent of oil and natural gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf is assessed at the earliest practicable time; and
<br>
<br>(10) establish a fishermen's contingency fund to pay for damages to commercial fishing vessels and gear due to Outer Continental Shelf activities.

<br>§1843. Duties and powers of Secretary
<br>(a) Prescription and amendment of regulations respecting settlement of claims; identification classification of potential hazards to commercial fishing
<br>
<br>In carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) prescribe, and from time to time amend, regulations for the filing, processing, and fair and expeditious settlement of claims pursuant to this subchapter, including a time limitation of not less than 90 days on the filing of such claims (except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, final regulations implementing the 1981 amendments to this subchapter shall be published in the Federal Register within 120 days after the date of the enactment of such amendments); and
<br>
<br>(2) identify and classify all potential hazards to commercial fishing caused by Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities, including all obstructions on the bottom, throughout the water column, and on the surface.
<br>(b) Establishment of regulations respecting color coding, stamping, or labeling of equipment, tools, etc., used on Outer Continental Shelf
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Interior shall establish regulations requiring all materials, equipment, tools, containers, and all other items used on the Outer Continental Shelf to be properly color coded, stamped, or labeled, wherever practicable, with the owner's identification prior to actual use.

The compensation payable under this section for resulting economic loss shall be an amount equal to 50 per centum of such loss. For purposes of this subsection, the term "resulting economic loss" means the gross income, as estimated by the Secretary, that a commercial fisherman who is eligible for compensation under this section will lose by reason of not being able to engage in fishing, or having to reduce his fishing effort, during the period before the damaged or lost fishing gear concerned is repaired or replaced and available for use.

<br>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, no payment may be made by the Secretary from the Fund—
<br>
<br>(A) to the extent that damages were caused by the negligence or fault of the commercial fisherman making the claim;
<br>
<br>(B) if the damage set forth in the claim was sustained prior to September 18, 1978;
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a claim for damage to, or loss of, fishing gear, in an amount in excess of the replacement value of the fishing gear with respect to which the claim is filed; and
