<br>2When pride cometh, then cometh shame;
<br>But with the lowly is wisdom.
<br>
<br>3The integrity of the upright shall guide them;
<br>But the perverseness of the faithless shall destroy them.
<br>
<br>4Riches profit not in the day of wrath;
<br>But righteousness delivereth from death.
<br>
<br>5The righteousness of the sincere shall make straight his way;
<br>But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
<br> 
<br>6The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them;
<br>But the faithless shall be trapped in their own crafty device.
<br>
<br>7When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish,
<br>And the hope of strength perisheth.
<br>
<br>8The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
<br>And the wicked cometh in his stead.
<br>
<br>9With his mouth the impious man destroyeth his neighbour;
<br>But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.
<br>
<br>10When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth;
<br>And when the wicked perish, there is joy.
<br>
<br>11By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted;
<br>But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
<br>
<br>12He that despiseth his neighbour lacketh understanding;
<br>But a man of discernment holdeth his peace.
<br>
<br>13He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets;
<br>But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.
<br> 
<br>14Where no wise direction is, a people falleth;
<br>But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
<br>
<br>15He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it;
<br>But he that hateth them that strike hands is secure.
<br>
<br>16A gracious woman obtaineth honour;
<br>And strong men obtain riches.
<br>
<br>17The merciful man doeth good to his own soul;
<br>But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
<br>
<br>18The wicked earneth deceitful wages;
<br>But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.
<br>
<br>19Stedfast righteousness tendeth to life;
<br>But he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.
<br>
<br>20They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But such as are upright in their way are His delight.
<br>
<br>21My hand upon it! the evil man shall not be unpunished;
<br>But the seed of the righteous shall escape.
<br> 
<br>22As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion.
<br>
<br>23The desire of the righteous is only good;
<br>But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
<br>
<br>24There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
<br>And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want.
<br>
<br>25The beneficent soul shall be made rich, and he that satisfieth abundantly shall be satisfied also himself.
<br>
<br>26He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him;
<br>But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
<br>
<br>27He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favour;
<br>But he that searcheth for evil, it shall come unto him.
<br>
<br>28He that trusteth in his riches shall fall;
<br>But the righteous shall flourish as foliage.
<br>
<br>29He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind;
<br>And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
<br> 
<br>
<br>30The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
<br>And he that is wise winneth souls.
<br>
<br>31Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth;
<br>How much more the wicked and the sinner!
<br>
<br>Whoso loveth knowledge loveth correction;
<br>But he that is brutish hateth reproof.
<br>
<br>2A good man shall obtain favour of the LORD;
<br>But a man of wicked devices will He condemn.
<br>
<br>3A man shall not be established by wickedness;
<br>But the root of the righteous shall never be moved.
<br>
<br>4A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband;
<br>But she that doeth shamefully is as rottenness in his bones.
<br>
<br>5The thoughts of the righteous are right;
<br>But the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
<br>
<br>6The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood;
<br>But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
<br> 
<br>7The wicked are overthrown, and are not;
<br>But the house of the righteous shall stand.
<br>
<br>8A man shall be commended according to his intelligence;
<br>But he that is of a distorted understanding shall be despised.
<br>
<br>9Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant,
<br>Than he that playeth the man of rank, and lacketh bread.
<br>
<br>10A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast;
<br>But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
<br>
<br>11He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread;
<br>But he that followeth after vain things is void of understanding.
<br>
<br>12The wicked desireth the prey of evil men;
<br>But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.
<br>
<br>13In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man;
<br>But the righteous cometh out of trouble.
<br>
<br>14A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth,
<br>And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.
<br> 
<br>
<br>15The way of a fool is straight in his own eyes;
<br>But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel.
<br>
<br>16A fool’s vexation is presently known;
<br>But a prudent man concealeth shame.
<br>
<br>17He that breatheth forth truth uttereth righteousness;
<br>But a false witness deceit.
<br>
<br>18There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword;
<br>But the tongue of the wise is health.
<br>
<br>19The lip of truth shall be established for ever;
<br>But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
<br>
<br>20Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil;
<br>But to the counsellors of peace is joy.
<br>
<br>21There shall no mischief befall the righteous;
<br>But the wicked are filled with evil.
<br>
<br>22Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But they that deal truly are His delight.
<br> 
<br>23A prudent man concealeth knowledge;
<br>But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
<br>
<br>24The hand of the diligent shall bear rule;
<br>But the slothful shall be under tribute.
<br>
<br>25Care in the heart of a man boweth it down;
<br>But a good word maketh it glad.
<br>
<br>26The righteous is guided by his friend;
<br>But the way of the wicked leadeth them astray.
<br>
<br>27The slothful man shall not hunt his prey;
<br>But the precious substance of men is to be diligent.
<br>
<br>28In the way of righteousness is life,
<br>And in the pathway thereof there is no death.
<br>
<br>A wise son is instructed of his father;
<br>But a scorner heareth not rebuke.
<br>
<br>2A man shall eat good from the fruit of his mouth;
<br>But the desire of the faithless is violence.
<br>
<br>3He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life;
<br> 
<br>But for him that openeth wide his lips there shall be ruin.
<br>
<br>4The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing;
<br>But the soul of the diligent shall be abundantly gratified.
<br>
<br>5A righteous man hateth lying;
<br>But a wicked man behaveth vilely and shamefully.
<br>
<br>6Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way;
<br>But wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
<br>
<br>7There is that pretendeth himself rich, yet hath nothing;
<br>There is that pretendeth himself poor, yet hath great wealth.
<br>
<br>8The ransom of a man’s life are his riches;
<br>But the poor heareth no threatening.
<br>
<br>9The light of the righteous rejoiceth;
<br>But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
<br>
<br>10By pride cometh only contention;
<br>But with the well-advised is wisdom.
<br>
<br>11Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished;
<br>But he that gathereth little by little shall increase.
<br> 
<br>12Hope deferred maketh the heart sick;
<br>But desire fulfilled is a tree of life.
<br>
<br>13Whoso despiseth the word shall suffer thereby;
<br>But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
<br>
<br>14The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
<br>To depart from the snares of death.
<br>
<br>15Good understanding giveth grace; But the way of the faithless is harsh.
<br>
<br>16Every prudent man dealeth with forethought;
<br>But a fool unfoldeth folly.
<br>
<br>17A wicked messenger falleth into evil;
<br>But a faithful ambassador is health.
<br>
<br>18Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction;
<br>But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.
<br>
<br>19The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul;
<br>And it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
<br>
<br>20He that walketh with wise men shall be wise;
<br>But the companion of fools shall smart for it.
<br> 
<br>21Evil pursueth sinners;
<br>But to the righteous good shall be repaid.
<br>
<br>22A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children;
<br>And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.
<br>
<br>23Much food is in the tillage of the poor;
<br>But there is that is swept away by want of righteousness.
<br>
<br>24He that spareth his rod hateth his son;
<br>But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.
<br>
<br>25The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his desire;
<br>But the belly of the wicked shall want.
<br>
<br>Every wise woman buildeth her house;
<br>But the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.
<br>
<br>2He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD;
<br>But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth Him.
<br>
<br>3In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride;
<br>But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
<br> 
<br>4Where no oxen are, the crib is clean;
<br>But much increase is by the strength of the ox.
<br>
<br>5A faithful witness will not lie;
<br>But a false witness breatheth forth lies.
<br>
<br>6A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not;
<br>But knowledge is easy unto him that hath discernment.
<br>
<br>7Go from the presence of a foolish man, for thou wilt not perceive the lips of knowledge.
<br>
<br>8The wisdom of the prudent is to look well to his way;
<br>But the folly of fools is deceit.
<br>
<br>9Amends pleadeth for fools;
<br>But among the upright there is good will.
<br>
<br>10The heart knoweth its own bitterness;
<br>And with its joy no stranger can intermeddle.
<br>
<br>11The house of the wicked shall be overthrown;
<br>But the tent of the upright shall flourish.
<br>
<br>12There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
<br> 
<br>But the end thereof are the ways of death.
<br>
<br>13Even in laughter the heart acheth; And the end of mirth is heaviness.
<br>
<br>14The dissembler in heart shall have his fill from his own ways;
<br>And a good man shall be satisfied from himself.
<br>
<br>15The thoughtless believeth every word;
<br>But the prudent man looketh well to his going.
<br>
<br>16A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil;
<br>But the fool behaveth overbearingly, and is confident.
<br>
<br>17He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly;
<br>And a man of wicked devices is hated.
<br>
<br>18The thoughtless come into possession of folly;
<br>But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
<br>
<br>19The evil bow before the good,
<br>And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
<br>
<br>20The poor is hated even of his own neighbour;
<br>But the rich hath many friends.
<br> 
<br>21He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth;
<br>But he that is gracious unto the humble, happy is he.
<br>
<br>22Shall they not go astray that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be for them that devise good.
<br>
<br>23In all labour there is profit;
<br>But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.
<br>
<br>24The crown of the wise is their riches;
<br>But the folly of fools remaineth folly.
<br>
<br>25A true witness delivereth souls;
<br>But he that breatheth forth lies is all deceit.
<br>
<br>26In the fear of the LORD a man hath strong confidence;
<br>And his children shall have a place of refuge.
<br>
<br>27The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.
<br>
<br>28In the multitude of people is the king’s glory;
<br>But in the want of people is the ruin of the prince.
<br>
<br>29He that is slow to anger is of great understanding;
<br> 
<br>But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
<br>
<br>30A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh;
<br>But envy is the rottenness of the bones.
<br>
<br>31He that oppresseth the poor blasphemeth his Maker;
<br>But he that is gracious unto the needy honoureth Him.
<br>
<br>32The wicked is thrust down in his misfortune;
<br>But the righteous, even when he is brought to death, hath hope.
<br>
<br>33In the heart of him that hath discernment wisdom resteth;
<br>But in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known.
<br>
<br>34Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.
<br>
<br>35The king’s favour is toward a servant that dealeth wisely;
<br>But his wrath striketh him that dealeth shamefully.
<br>
<br>A soft answer turneth away wrath;
<br>But a grievous word stirreth up anger.
<br>
<br>2The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright;
<br> 
<br>But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.
<br>
<br>3The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
<br>Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.
<br>
<br>4A soothing tongue is a tree of life;
<br>But perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit.
<br>
<br>5A fool despiseth his father’s correction;
<br>But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.
<br>
<br>6In the house of the righteous is much treasure;
<br>But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
<br>
<br>7The lips of the wise disperse knowledge;
<br>But the heart of the foolish is not stedfast.
<br>
<br>8The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But the prayer of the upright is His delight.
<br>
<br>9The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But He loveth him that followeth after righteousness.
<br>
<br>10There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way;
<br> 
<br>And he that hateth reproof shall die.
<br>
<br>11The nether-world and Destruction are before the LORD;
<br>How much more then the hearts of the children of men!
<br>
<br>12A scorner loveth not to be reproved;
<br>He will not go unto the wise.
<br>
<br>13A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance;
<br>But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.
<br>
<br>14The heart of him that hath discernment seeketh knowledge;
<br>But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.
<br>
<br>15All the days of the poor are evil;
<br>But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.
<br>
<br>16Better is little with the fear of the LORD,
<br>Than great treasure and turmoil therewith.
<br>
<br>17Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
<br>Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
<br>
<br>18A wrathful man stirreth up discord;
<br>But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.
<br> 
<br>
<br>19The way of the sluggard is as though hedged by thorns;
<br>But the path of the upright is even.
<br>
<br>20A wise son maketh a glad father;
<br>But a foolish man despiseth his mother.
<br>
<br>21Folly is joy to him that lacketh understanding;
<br>But a man of discernment walketh straightforwards.
<br>
<br>22For want of counsel purposes are frustrated;
<br>But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.
<br>
<br>23A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth;
<br>And a word in due season, how good is it!
<br>
<br>24The path of life goeth upward for the wise, that he may depart from the nether-world beneath.
<br>
<br>25The LORD will pluck up the house of the proud;
<br>But He will establish the border of the widow.
<br>
<br>26The thoughts of wickedness are an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But words of pleasantness are pure.
<br>
<br>27He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
<br> 
<br>But he that hateth gifts shall live.
<br>
<br>28The heart of the righteous studieth to answer;
<br>But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
<br>
<br>29The LORD is far from the wicked;
<br>But He heareth the prayer of the righteous.
<br>
<br>30The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart;
<br>And a good report maketh the bones fat.
<br>
<br>31The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
<br>
<br>32He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul;
<br>But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.
<br>
<br>33The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom;
<br>And before honour goeth humility.
<br>
<br>The preparations of the heart are man’s,
<br>But the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.
<br>
<br>2All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
<br>But the LORD weigheth the spirits.
<br>
<br>3Commit thy works unto the LORD,
<br> 
<br>And thy thoughts shall be established.
<br>
<br>4The LORD hath made every things for His own purpose,
<br>Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
<br>
<br>5Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD;
<br>My hand upon it! he shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<br>6By mercy and truth iniquity is expiated;
<br>And by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.
<br>
<br>7When a man’s ways please the LORD,
<br>He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
<br>
<br>8Better is a little with righteousness Than great revenues with injustice.
<br>
<br>9A man’s heart deviseth his way; But the LORD directeth his steps.
<br>
<br>10A divine sentence is in the lips of the king;
<br>His mouth trespasseth not in judgment.
<br>
<br>11A just balance and scales are the LORD’S;
<br>All the weights of the bag are His work.
<br> 
<br>12It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness;
<br>For the throne is established by righteousness.
<br>
<br>13Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
<br>And they love him that speaketh right.
<br>
<br>14The wrath of a king is as messengers of death;
<br>But a wise man will pacify it.
<br>
<br>15In the light of the king’s countenance is life;
<br>And his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.
<br>
<br>16How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!
<br>Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
<br>
<br>17The highway of the upright is to depart from evil;
<br>He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
<br>
<br>18Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.
<br>
<br>19Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the humble,
<br>Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
<br>
<br>20He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good;
<br> 
<br>And whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.
<br>
<br>21The wise in heart is called a man of discernment;
<br>And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
<br>
<br>22Understanding is a fountain of life unto him that hath it;
<br>But folly is the chastisement of fools.
<br>
<br>23The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth,
<br>And addeth learning to his lips.
<br>
<br>24Pleasant words are as a honeycomb,
<br>Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
<br>
<br>25There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
<br>But the end thereof are the ways of death.
<br>
<br>26The hunger of the labouring man laboureth for him;
<br>For his mouth compelleth him.
<br>
<br>27An ungodly man diggeth up evil,
<br>And in his lips there is as a burning fire.
<br>
<br>28A froward man soweth strife;
<br>And a whisperer separateth familiar friends.
<br> 
<br>29A man of violence enticeth his neighbour,
<br>And leadeth him into a way that is not good.
<br>
<br>30He shutteth his eyes, it is to devise froward things;
<br>He that biteth his lips bringeth evil to pass.
<br>
<br>31The hoary head is a crown of glory,
<br>It is found in the way of righteousness.
<br>
<br>32He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
<br>And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
<br>
<br>33The lot is cast into the lap;
<br>But the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
<br>
<br>Better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith,
<br>Than a house full of feasting with strife.
<br>
<br>2A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that dealeth shamefully,
<br>And shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
<br>
<br>3The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
<br>But the LORD trieth the hearts.
<br> 
<br>4A evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips;
<br>And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.
<br>
<br>5Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker;
<br>And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<br>6Children’s children are the crown of old men;
<br>And the glory of children are their fathers.
<br>
<br>7Overbearing speech becometh not a churl;
<br>Much less do lying lips a prince.
<br>
<br>8A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it;
<br>Whithersoever he turneth, he prospereth.
<br>
<br>9He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
<br>But he that harpeth on a matter estrangeth a familiar friend.
<br>
<br>10A rebuke entereth deeper into a man of understanding
<br>Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
<br>
<br>11A rebellious man seeketh only evil;
<br>Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
<br> 
<br>12Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
<br>Rather than a fool in his folly.
<br>
<br>13Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house.
<br>
<br>14The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water;
<br>Therefore leave off contention, before the quarrel break out.
<br>
<br>15He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
<br>Even they both are an abomination to the LORD.
<br>
<br>16Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool
<br>To buy wisdom, seeing he hath no understanding?
<br>
<br>17A friend loveth at all times,
<br>And a brother is born for adversity.
<br>
<br>18A man void of understanding is he that striketh hands,
<br>And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbour.
<br>
<br>19He loveth transgression that loveth strife;
<br>He that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
<br>
<br>20He that hath a froward heart findeth no good;
<br>And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into evil.
<br> 
<br>
<br>21He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow;
<br>And the father of a churl hath no joy.
<br>
<br>22A merry heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth the bones.
<br>
<br>23A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom,
<br>To pervert the ways of justice.
<br>
<br>24Wisdom is before him that hath understanding;
<br>But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
<br>
<br>25A foolish son is vexation to his father,
<br>And bitterness to her that bore him.
<br>
<br>26To punish also the righteous is not good,
<br>Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.
<br>
<br>27He that spareth his words hath knowledge;
<br>And he that husbandeth his spirit is a man of discernment.
<br>
<br>28Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise;
<br>And he that shutteth his lips is esteemed as a man of understanding.
<br> 
<br>He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire,
<br>And snarlest against all sound wisdom.
<br>
<br>2A fool hath no delight in understanding,
<br>But only that his heart may lay itself bare.
<br>
<br>3When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt,
<br>And with ignominy reproach.
<br>
<br>4The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters;
<br>A flowing brook, a fountain of wisdom.
<br>
<br>5It is not good to respect the person of the wicked,
<br>So as to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
<br>
<br>6A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for strokes.
<br>
<br>7A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
<br>And his lips are the snare of his soul.
<br>
<br>8The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
<br>And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
<br>
<br>9Even one that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
<br> 
<br>10The name of the LORD is a strong tower:
<br>The righteous runneth into it, and is set up on high.
<br>
<br>11The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
<br>And as a high wall in his own conceit.
<br>
<br>12Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty,
<br>And before honour goeth humility.
<br>
<br>13He that giveth answer before he heareth,
<br>It is folly and confusion unto him.
<br>
<br>14The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
<br>But a broken spirit who can bear?
<br>
<br>15The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
<br>And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
<br>
<br>16A man’s gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men.
<br>
<br>17He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just;
<br>But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out.
<br>
<br>18The lot causeth strife to cease, And parteth asunder the contentious.
<br> 
<br>19A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city;
<br>And their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
<br>
<br>20A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth;
<br>With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
<br>
<br>21Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
<br>And they that indulge it shall eat the fruit thereof.
<br>
<br>22Whoso findeth a wife findeth a great good,
<br>And obtaineth favour of the LORD.
<br>
<br>23The poor useth entreaties;
<br>But the rich answereth impudently.
<br>
<br>24There are friends that one hath to his own hurt;
<br>But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
<br>
<br>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity
<br>Than he that is perverse in his lips and a fool at the same time.
<br>
<br>2Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good;
<br>And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
<br>
<br>3The foolishness of man perverteth his way;
<br> 
<br>And his heart fretteth against the LORD.
<br>
<br>4Wealth addeth many friends;
<br>But as for the poor, his friend separateth himself from him.
<br>
<br>5A false witness shall not be unpunished;
<br>And he that breatheth forth lies shall not escape.
<br>
<br>6Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man;
<br>And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
<br>
<br>7All the brethren of the poor do hate him;
<br>How much more do his friends go far from him!
<br>He that pursueth words, they turn against him.
<br>
<br>8He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul;
<br>He that keepeth understanding shall find good.
<br>
<br>9A false witness shall not be unpunished;
<br>And he that breatheth forth lies shall perish.
<br>
<br>10Luxury is not seemly for a fool;
<br>Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
<br> 
<br>11It is the discretion of a man to be slow to anger,
<br>And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
<br>
<br>12The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
<br>But his favour is as dew upon the grass.
<br>
<br>13A foolish son is the calamity of his father;
<br>And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
<br>
<br>14House and riches are the inheritance of fathers;
<br>But a prudent wife is from the LORD.
<br>
<br>15Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
<br>And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.
<br>
<br>16He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul;
<br>But he that despiseth His ways shall die.
<br>
<br>17He that is gracious unto the poor lendeth unto the LORD;
<br>And his good deed will He repay unto him.
<br>
<br>18Chasten thy son, for there is hope;
<br>But set not thy heart on his destruction.
<br> 
<br>19A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment;
<br>For if thou interpose, thou wilt add thereto.
<br>
<br>20Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
<br>That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
<br>
<br>21There are many devices in a man’s heart;
<br>But the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
<br>
<br>22The lust of a man is his shame; And a poor man is better than a liar.
<br>
<br>23The fear of the LORD tendeth to life;
<br>And he that hath it shall abide satisfied,
<br>He shall not be visited with evil.
<br>
<br>24The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish,
<br>And will not so much as bring it back to his mouth.
<br>
<br>25When thou smitest a scorner, the simple will become prudent;
<br>And when one that hath understanding is reproved, he will understand knowledge.
<br>
<br>26A son that dealeth shamefully and reproachfully
<br>Will despoil his father, and chase away his mother.
<br> 
<br>
<br>27Cease, my son, to hear the instruction
<br>That causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
<br>
<br>28An ungodly witness mocketh at right;
<br>And the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
<br>
<br>29Judgments are prepared for scorners,
<br>And stripes for the back of fools.
<br>
<br>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous;
<br>And whosoever reeleth thereby is not wise.
<br>
<br>2The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion:
<br>He that provoketh him to anger forfeiteth his life.
<br>
<br>3It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from strife;
<br>But every fool will be snarling.
<br>
<br>4The sluggard will not plow when winter setteth in;
<br>Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
<br>
<br>5Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;
<br>But a man of understanding will draw it out.
<br> 
<br>6Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness;
<br>But a faithful man who can find?
<br>
<br>7He that walketh in his integrity as a just man,
<br>Happy are his children after him.
<br>
<br>8A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment
<br>Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
<br>
<br>9Who can say: ‘I have made my heart clean,
<br>I am pure from my sin’?
<br>
<br>10Divers weights, and divers measures,
<br>Both of them alike are abomination to the LORD.
<br>
<br>11Even a child is known by his doings,
<br>Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
<br>
<br>12The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
<br>The LORD hath made even both of them.
<br>
<br>13Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
<br>Open thine eyes, and thou shalt have bread in plenty.
<br>
<br>14’It is bad, it is bad’, saith the buyer;
<br> 
<br>But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
<br>
<br>15There is gold, and a multitude of rubies;
<br>But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
<br>
<br>16Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
<br>And hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman.
<br>
<br>17Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man;
<br>But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
<br>
<br>18Every purpose is established by counsel;
<br>And with good advice carry on war.
<br>
<br>19He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets;
<br>Therefore meddle not with him that openeth wide his lips.
<br>
<br>20Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
<br>His lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness.
<br>
<br>21An estate may be gotten hastily at the beginning;
<br>But the end thereof shall not be blessed.
<br>
<br>22Say not thou: ‘I will requite evil’;
<br> 
<br>Wait for the LORD, and He will save thee.
<br>
<br>23Divers weights are an abomination to the LORD;
<br>And a false balance is not good.
<br>
<br>24A man’s goings are of the LORD; How then can man look to his way?
<br>
<br>25It is a snare to a man rashly to say: ‘Holy’,
<br>And after vows to make inquiry.
<br>
<br>26A wise king sifteth the wicked, And turneth the wheel over them.
<br>
<br>27The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD,
<br>Searching all the inward parts.
<br>
<br>28Mercy and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upheld by mercy.
<br>
<br>29The glory of young men is their strength;
<br>And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.
<br>
<br>30Sharp wounds cleanse away evil;
<br>So do stripes that reach the inward parts.
<br>
<br>The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the watercourses:
<br>He turneth it whithersoever He will.
<br> 
<br>2Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;
<br>But the LORD weigheth the hearts.
<br>
<br>3To do righteousness and justice
<br>Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
<br>
<br>4A haughty look, and a proud heart—
<br>The tillage of the wicked is sin.
<br>
<br>5The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;
<br>But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want.
<br>
<br>6The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
<br>Is a vapour driven to and fro; they [that seek them] seek death.
<br>
<br>7The violence of the wicked shall drag them away;
<br>Because they refuse to do justly.
<br>
<br>8The way of man is froward and strange;
<br>But as for the pure, his work is right.
<br>
<br>9It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop,
<br>Than in a house in common with a contentious woman.
<br>
<br>10The soul of the wicked desireth evil;
<br>His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
<br> 
<br>
<br>11When the scorner is punished, the thoughtless is made wise;
<br>And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
<br>
<br>12The Righteous One considereth the house of the wicked;
<br>Overthrowing the wicked to their ruin.
<br>
<br>13Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
<br>He also shall cry himself, but shall not be answered.
<br>
<br>14A gift in secret pacifieth anger,
<br>And a present in the bosom strong wrath.
<br>
<br>15To do justly is joy to the righteous, But ruin to the workers of iniquity.
<br>
<br>16The man that strayeth out of the way of understanding
<br>Shall rest in the congregation of the shades.
<br>
<br>17He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man;
<br>He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
<br>
<br>18The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;
<br>And the faithless cometh in the stead of the upright.
<br> 
<br>19It is better to dwell in a desert land,
<br>Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
<br>
<br>20There is desirable treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
<br>But a foolish man swalloweth it up.
<br>
<br>21He that followeth after righteousness and mercy
<br>Findeth life, prosperity, and honour.
<br>
<br>22A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
<br>And bringeth down the stronghold wherein it trusteth.
<br>
<br>23Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
<br>Keepeth his soul from troubles.
<br>
<br>24A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name,
<br>Even he that dealeth in overbearing pride.
<br>
<br>25The desire of the slothful killeth him;
<br>For his hands refuse to labour.
<br>
<br>26There is that coveteth greedily all the day long;
<br>But the righteous giveth and spareth not.
<br>
<br>27The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
<br> 
<br>How much more, when he bringeth it with the proceeds of wickedness?
<br>
<br>28A false witness shall perish;
<br>But the man that obeyeth shall speak unchallenged.
<br>
<br>29A wicked man hardeneth his face;
<br>But as for the upright, he looketh well to his way.
<br>
<br>30There is no wisdom nor understanding
<br>Nor counsel against the LORD.
<br>
<br>31The horse is prepared against the day of battle;
<br>But victory is of the LORD.
<br>
<br>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
<br>And loving favour rather than silver and gold.
<br>
<br>2The rich and the poor meet together—
<br>The LORD is the maker of them all.
<br>
<br>3A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself;
<br>But the thoughtless pass on, and are punished.
<br>
<br>4The reward of humility is the fear of the LORD,
<br>Even riches, and honour, and life.
<br> 
<br>5Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward;
<br>He that keepeth his soul holdeth himself far from them.
<br>
<br>6Train up a child in the way he should go,
<br>And even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
<br>
<br>7The rich ruleth over the poor,
<br>And the borrower is servant to the lender.
<br>
<br>8He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity;
<br>And the rod of his wrath shall fail.
<br>
<br>9He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
<br>For he giveth of his bread to the poor.
