<br>§559. Benefits for members held as captives
<br>
<br>(a) In this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "captive status" means a missing status of a member of the uniformed services which, as determined by the President, arises because of a hostile action and is a result of membership in the uniformed services, but does not include a period of captivity of a member as a prisoner of war if Congress provides to such member, in an Act enacted after August 27, 1986, monetary payment in respect of such period of captivity.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "former captive" means a person who, as a member of the uniformed services, was held in a captive status.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a savings fund to which the Secretary concerned may allot all or any portion of the pay and allowances of any member of the uniformed services who is in a captive status to the extent that such pay and allowances are not subject to an allotment under section 553 of this title or any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter. Such interest shall be computed quarterly.
<br>
<br>(3) Amounts in the savings fund credited to a member shall be considered as pay and allowances for purposes of section 553(c) of this title and shall otherwise be subject to withdrawal under procedures which the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish.
<br>
<br>(4) Any interest accruing under this subsection on—
<br>
<br>(A) any amount for which a member is indebted to the United States under section 552(c) of this title shall be deemed to be part of the amount due under such section; and
<br>
<br>(B) any amount referred to in section 556(f) of this title shall be deemed to be part of such amount for purposes of such section.
<br>
<br>(5) An allotment under this subsection may be made without regard to section 553(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the President shall make a cash payment to any person who is a former captive. Such payment shall be made before the end of the one-year period beginning on the date on which the captive status of such person terminates.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as provided in section 802 of the Victims of Terrorism Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5569 note), the amount of such payment shall be determined by the President under the provisions of section 5569(d)(2) of title 5.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The President—
<br>
<br>(i) may defer such payment in the case of any former captive who during such one-year period is charged with an offense described in clause (ii), until final disposition of such charge; and
<br>
<br>(ii) may deny such payment in the case of any former captive who is convicted of a captivity-related offense—
<br>
<br>(I) referred to in subsection (b) or (c) of section 8312 of title 5; or
<br>
<br>(II) under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that is punishable by dishonorable discharge, dismissal, or confinement for one year or more.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a captivity-related offense is an offense that is—
<br>
<br>(i) committed by a person while the person is in a captive status; and
<br>
<br>(ii) related to the captive status of the person.
<br>
<br>(4) A payment under this subsection is in addition to any other amount provided by law.
<br>
<br>(5) Any amount due a person under this subsection shall, after the death of such person, be deemed to be pay and allowances for the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) that is later denied under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of section 3711 of title 31.
<br>
<br>(d) A determination by the President under subsection (a)(1) or (c) is final and is not subject to judicial review.
<br>

<br>§601. Applicability
<br>
<br>This chapter applies to—
<br>
<br>(1) members of a uniformed service who are on active duty (other than for training) or who are on a retired list of that service; and
<br>
<br>(2) members of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.

<br>601 	37:351. 	June 21, 1950, ch. 342, §1, 64 Stat. 249.
<br>
<br>The words "on active duty (other than for training)" are substituted for the words "on the active . . . list" to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no "active list" in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the "Regular Army" and the "Regular Air Force". The words "a retired list of that service" are substituted for the words "retired list", since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.) The words "members of the Reserve components of the respective services entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said services" are omitted as covered by clause (1), since members of the reserve components are members of the uniformed services concerned. The word "transferred" is omitted as surplusage.
<br>§602. Payments: designation of person to receive amounts due
<br>
<br>(a) Active duty pay and allowances, amounts due for accrued or accumulated leave, or retired or retainer pay, that are otherwise payable to a member to whom this chapter applies and who is mentally incapable of managing his affairs, may be paid for that member's use or benefit to—
<br>
<br>(1) a legal committee, guardian, or other representative that has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
<br>
<br>(2) an individual to whom the member has granted authority to manage such funds pursuant to a valid and legally executed durable power of attorney; or
<br>
<br>(3) any person designated by the Secretary concerned, or by any officer to whom he delegates his authority under this section, without the appointment in judicial proceedings of a committee, guardian, or other legal representative.
<br>
<br>(b) An individual may not be designated under subsection (a)(3) to receive payments unless a board consisting of at least three qualified medical officers or physicians, one of whom is specially qualified in the treatment of mental disorders, determines that the member is mentally incapable of managing the member's affairs. Any such board shall be appointed from available medical officers or physicians under his jurisdiction by the head of whichever of the following is providing medical treatment for the member, or by a person designated by that head—
<br>
<br>(1) Department of the Army;
<br>
<br>(2) Department of the Navy;
<br>
<br>(3) Department of the Air Force;
<br>
<br>(4) Department of Health and Human Services; or
<br>
<br>(5) Department of Veterans Affairs.
<br>
<br>If the hospitalization or medical care of the member is not provided by the United States, the board shall be appointed by the Secretary of the department having jurisdiction of the member.
<br>
<br>(c) A payment made to a person who is authorized to receive payments under this section discharges the obligation of the United States as to the amount paid.
<br>
<br>(d) A person serving in a legal, medical, fiduciary, or other capacity, may not demand or accept a fee, commission, or other charge for any service performed under this chapter, unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders payment of such fee, commission, or other charge.
<br>
<br>(e) A person who is designated under subsection (a)(3) to receive payments under this section shall furnish satisfactory assurance that the amounts received by him will be applied to the use and benefit of the incompetent member, and, where the payments may reasonably be expected to be more than $25,000, shall provide a suitable bond to be paid for out of amounts due the incompetent member.

<br>
<br>(b) A contract surgeon, or contract dental surgeon, of the Army, Navy, or Air Force, on duty in Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, or Puerto Rico, may transfer or assign the person's pay account, when due and payable, under the regulations prescribed under subsection (a).

<br>
<br>(d) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Space Force and a contract surgeon of the Army, Navy, or Air Force may make allotments from the pay of the member or surgeon for the purpose of supporting relatives or for any other purpose that the Secretary considers proper. Such allotments may include a maximum of six allotments considered to be discretionary under such regulations. For a member or former member entitled to retired or retainer pay, a maximum of six discretionary allotments authorized during active military service may be continued into retired status, and new discretionary allotments may be authorized so long as the total number of discretionary allotments does not exceed six.
<br>
<br>(e) If an allotment made under subsection (d) is paid to the allottee before the disbursing officer receives a notice of discontinuance from the officer required by regulation to furnish the notice, the amount of the allotment shall be credited to the disbursing officer. If an allotment is erroneously paid because the officer required by regulation to so report failed to report the death of the allotter or any other fact that makes the allotment not payable, the amount of the payment not recovered from the allottee shall, if practicable, be collected by the Secretary concerned from the officer who failed to make the report.

<br>
<br>Applicability of the source law to the Air Force is based on Transfer Order No. 25(zzz), of the Secretary of Defense, dated October 14, 1948. Its applicability, other than to the Army and the Air Force, is based upon an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG 135: DDC; dmt.; 4229, dated July 29, 1960. The words "(but not above that of pay grade O–7)" are substituted for section 235a (proviso) of existing title 37.
<br>§902. Pay of crews of wrecked or lost naval vessels
<br>
<br>(a) When the accounts of the disbursing officer of a naval vessel are lost as a result of the destruction of the vessel, his return for the last month may, unless there is official evidence to the contrary, be used in computing later credits to and settling accounts of persons, other than officers, carried on his accounts. If the return for the last month has not been made, the pay accounts may be settled on principles of equity and justice.
<br>
<br>(b) When a naval vessel is lost or has not been heard from for so long that her loss may be presumed, the Secretary of the Navy may fix the date of loss of the vessel for the purpose of settling the accounts of persons aboard other than officers.
<br>
<br>(c) When the crew of a naval vessel is separated from that vessel because of her wreck, loss, or destruction, the pay and emoluments of those officers and enlisted members that the Secretary considers (because of the sentence of a court-martial or the finding of a court of inquiry, or by other satisfactory evidence) to have done their utmost to save the vessel and, after the wreck, loss, or destruction, to have behaved themselves according to the discipline of the Navy, continue and shall be paid to them until their discharge or death, whichever is earlier.
