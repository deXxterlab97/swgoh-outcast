<br>§2531. Personnel of former Lighthouse Service
<br>
<br>(a) Any individual of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned as an officer in the Coast Guard shall be an extra number in his grade and in the grades to which he may be promoted. He shall take precedence (1) with other officers commissioned in his grade from the former Lighthouse Service as the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, and (2) with other line officers in his grade in accordance with the respective dates of their commissions in such grade. He shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, at such time as the officer in a regular number in line of promotion next above him on the seniority list becomes eligible for promotion; or if there be no such officer in his grade, he shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, when a vacancy occurs in the next higher grade. An officer so commissioned shall be assigned to duty for which he is specially qualified, and professional examinations for promotion given to such officer shall embrace only subjects which pertain to the duty to which he is assigned.
<br>
<br>(b) Each vacancy (1) hereafter occurring in the extra numbers of such officers; (2) existing on August 5, 1939, in positions in the Lighthouse Service formerly held by personnel eligible for such commissions; and (3) created by the retirement, resignation, death, or separation from the service for any other cause, of such personnel who do not possess the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or who, being qualified, do not accept a commission thereunder, shall operate to increase by one the total authorized number of line officers of the Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>(c) All individuals of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall be subject to all laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard, and nothing contained in this title shall be construed to prevent the application to any of such individuals of laws and regulations concerning the military discipline of commissioned and warrant officers and enlisted members of the Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>(d) In computing length of service, for the purpose of retirement in the Coast Guard, of any individual of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard, there shall be included all service computable for retirement under the provisions of section 763 of title 33; and after July 1, 1948, in computing longevity for the purpose of pay of such individual there shall be included all service of such individual in the Lighthouse Service.
<br>
<br>(e) No individual so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall suffer any reduction in the total of the annual compensation and allowances which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment. Upon his retirement from active duty in the Coast Guard, the retired pay of any individual so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted, shall not be less than an annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of section 763 of title 33, substituting, however, for purposes of such computation, the annual compensation which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment in the Coast Guard for the average annual pay received by him for the last five years of service.
<br>
<br>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapter 51, subchapter III of chapter 53, and sections 5542–5546 of title 5 shall not apply to civilian keepers of lighthouses and to civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) The head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating under regulations prescribed by him, may regulate the hours of duty and the pay of civilian keepers of lighthouses and civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard, but such personnel may be called upon for duty in emergency circumstances or otherwise at any time or all times. The existing system governing the pay of such employees may be continued or changed except that overtime compensation, night differential, and extra pay for duty on holidays shall not be paid to such employees. In lieu thereof additional annual compensation may be authorized, which may be prescribed either as a fixed differential or as a percentage of the basic compensation otherwise applicable to such employees. In no case shall basic compensation exceed $15,000 per annum, except that nothing contained in this subsection shall operate to decrease the basic compensation of any individual employed by the Coast Guard on the date of enactment of this subsection, and in no case shall additions thereto exceed 25 percent of such basic compensation. Provision may be made for compensatory absence from duty when conditions of employment result in confinement because of isolation or in long periods of continuous duty; and provisions may likewise be made for extra allowance for service outside of the continental limits of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be included in any computation of compensation under section 6 of the Act of June 20, 1918 (33 U.S.C. 763).

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The following statement appeared in Senate Report No. 656, 81st Congress, in explanation of Senate Judiciary Committee amendment no. 3 which added former sections 431 (now repealed), 432 (now 2531), and 433 (now repealed):
<br>
<br>There are, at present, in the Coast Guard certain personnel who were transferred from the former Life Saving Service, the Lighthouse Service, the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, and the Bureau of Customs. The number of such personnel is not large and no new personnel can be taken on in these categories. As time goes on the numbers will be reduced by death or resignation and any other method of leaving the service until, eventually, there will be no one remaining in any of these groups. Certain laws appearing in existing title 14 applicable to such personnel were not included in this bill as it passed the House. The reason for such omission was that such laws were temporary in that they would eventually apply to no one, although no definite termination date was fixed in the law. While recognizing this fact, this committee feels that since said laws apply to a class of personnel and will so apply for an indeterminate period in the future, it is desirable to include such laws in this codification, subject to being repealed at such time as there are no longer any personnel in the Coast Guard, active or retired, to whom these sections would be applicable.
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §10g (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 477, §2, 53 Stat. 1216).
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §10h (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 477, §3, 53 Stat. 1216).
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(c) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §50 (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 477, §8, 53 Stat. 1217).
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §180 (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 477, §6, 53 Stat. 1217; June 24, 1948, ch. 627, 62 Stat. 644).
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §181 (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 477, §7, 53 Stat. 1217).
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(f) is based on section 1 of Public Law 143, 81st Congress, approved June 29, 1949.
<br>
<br>Proposed section 432(g) is based on sections 2 and 3 of Public Law 143, 81st Congress, approved June 29, 1949.

<br>
<br>2018—Pub. L. 115–282 renumbered section 468 of this title as this section.
<br>
<br>1996—Pub. L. 104–324 amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "The Coast Guard may make expenditures as necessary in order to obtain recruits for the service and cadet applicants, including advertising."
<br>§2702. Training
<br>
<br>The Coast Guard may make expenditures for the training of personnel, including books, school supplies, correspondence courses, motion picture equipment, and other equipment for instructional purposes.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 531, §469; renumbered §2702, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)

<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532, §476; Pub. L. 108–293, title II, §219, Aug. 9, 2004, 118 Stat. 1039; renumbered §2703, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15k (Apr. 20, 1939, ch. 75, 53 Stat. 582).
<br>
<br>The limitation on the amount for such contingencies is increased, and the amount is made available to the Commandant rather than solely to the Superintendent of the Academy as now prescribed by law. The authorization is to cover expenditures incident to the offices of the Commandant and the Superintendent of the Academy. The intent is that the amount authorized will be administered in a manner similar to that now employed by the Superintendent of the Academy under the authority of 14 U.S.C., §15k. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>§2704. Equipment to prevent accidents
<br>
<br>The Coast Guard may make such expenditures as are deemed appropriate for promotion and maintenance of the safety and occupational health of, and the prevention of accidents affecting, personnel of the Coast Guard, including the purchase of clothing, equipment, and other materials necessary thereto.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532, §477; renumbered §2704, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)

<br>
<br>Because of the wide variety of tasks assigned to Coast Guard personnel it is deemed advisable to broaden this authority to the more general language as rewritten, insofar as Coast Guard personnel are concerned, thus giving complete authority to protect their health.
<br>
<br>Said section would in no way be affected.
<br>
<br>Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to executive departments generally, it is not scheduled for repeal by this act. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is new to the Coast Guard, although it has been the practice for retired officers to wear the uniform when they so desire. Such authority is granted to retired officers of the Navy (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §389).

<br>§2707. Protection of uniform
<br>
<br>The provisions of law relating to the protection of the uniform of the United States Army, Navy, or Marine Corps shall apply to the protection of the uniform of the Coast Guard, in the same manner, to the same extent, and under the same conditions.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533, §484; renumbered §2707, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)

<br>(a) The Coast Guard may purchase uniforms, accouterments, and related equipment for sale to officer personnel and cadets of the Coast Guard.
<br>

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §30 (Jan. 12, 1919, ch. 8, 40 Stat. 1054). Said section was changed to have application to the Coast Guard at all times, rather than when the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.
<br>
<br>Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Navy and Marine Corps as well as the Coast Guard, it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 9 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §13, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §754 (July 1, 1898, ch. 346, §1, 30 Stat. 604; July 27, 1912, ch. 255, §2, 37 Stat. 239). Said section 13 was changed to have application to all enlisted personnel rather than to "crews of vessels in service" only. The provision of said section 754 which provided for the sale of clothing to civilian employees is eliminated as becoming obsolete.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) is new. Title 37, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §110 authorizes the payment of a cash allowance in case clothing is not furnished to enlisted persons of the Coast Guard. Clearly this presumes the authority to issue clothing to enlisted persons; this section makes the authority statutory. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>1962—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 87–649 repealed subsec. (c) which permitted the Coast Guard to purchase uniform clothing for distribution to enlisted personnel or to pay such enlisted personnel a cash clothing allowance.
<br>
<br>1950—Subsec. (c). Act Aug. 3, 1950, struck out "to" after "or".

<br>§2709. Procurement and sale of stores to members and civilian employees
<br>
<br>Such stores as the Secretary may designate may be procured and sold to members of the Coast Guard, and to the surviving spouses of such members.

That part relating to the acceptance of convicted deserters in the armed forces is placed in section 575 of this title.

<br>§2744. Life-saving medals
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award a Life-saving medal of gold or silver to any individual, including personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other individual from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the water in accordance with the following provisions:
<br>
<br>(1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;
<br>
<br>(2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold, but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver.
<br>
<br>(b) In order for an individual to be eligible for the Life-saving Medals the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) No individual shall receive more than one gold medal and one silver medal; but any individual who has received or may hereafter receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded. Medals and bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this subsection, may be awarded posthumously.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).
<br>
<br>Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.
<br>
<br>The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §§192–196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed "upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel". The medal of the first class was confined to cases of "extreme and heroic daring" and the medal of the second class was to be awarded "in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class" Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class "upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning" as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should "be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station". (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193, refers to rescues "within the United States", while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196, refers to rescues "in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction". The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
