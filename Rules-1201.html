<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Certain countries are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and related technologies that could be used to attack the United States or place at risk United States interests, deployed members of the Armed Forces, and allies of the United States and other friendly foreign countries.
<br>
<br>"(2) Certain countries continue to actively transfer or sell ballistic missile technologies in contravention of standards of behavior established by the United States and allies of the United States and other friendly foreign countries.
<br>
<br>"(3) The spread of ballistic missiles and related technologies worldwide has been slowed by a combination of national and international export controls, forward-looking diplomacy, and multilateral interdiction activities to restrict the development and transfer of such missiles and technologies.
<br>
<br>"(b) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States to develop, support, and strengthen international accords and other cooperative efforts to curtail the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies which could threaten the territory of the United States, allies of the United States and other friendly foreign countries, and deployed members of the Armed Forces of the United States with weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<br>"(c) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States should vigorously pursue foreign policy initiatives aimed at eliminating, reducing, or retarding the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the United States and the international community should continue to support and strengthen established international accords and other cooperative efforts, including United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (April 28, 2004) and the Missile Technology Control Regime, that are designed to eliminate, reduce, or retard the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies."

<br>§2797a. Denial of transfer of missile equipment or technology by United States persons
<br>(a) Sanctions
<br>
<br>(1) If the President determines that a United States person knowingly—
<br>
<br>(A) exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the trade of any item on the MTCR Annex, in violation of the provisions of section 2778 of this title, section 4604 or 4605 1 of title 50 or any regulations or orders issued under any such provisions,
<br>
<br>(B) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or
<br>
<br>(C) facilitates such export, transfer, or trade by any other person,
<br>
<br>then the President shall impose the applicable sanctions described in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(2) The sanctions which apply to a United States person under paragraph (1) are the following:
<br>
<br>(A) If the item on the MTCR Annex involved in the export, transfer, or trade is missile equipment or technology within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny to such United States person for a period of 2 years—

<br>(i) United States Government contracts relating to missile equipment or technology; and
<br>

<br>(c) Presumption
<br>
<br>In determining whether to apply sanctions under subsection (a) to a United States person involved in the export, transfer, or trade of an item on the MTCR Annex, it should be a rebuttable presumption that such item is designed for use in a missile listed in the MTCR Annex if the President determines that the final destination of the item is a country the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of 2 4605(j)(1)(A) 1 of title 50, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
<br>(d) Waiver
<br>
<br>The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under subsection (a) with respect to a product or service if the President certifies to the Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the product or service is essential to the national security of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or service, the product or service is not available from any alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved manufacturing processes or technological developments.

<br>§2797b. Transfers of missile equipment or technology by foreign persons
<br>(a) Sanctions
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to subsections (c) through (g),1 if the President determines that a foreign person, after November 5, 1990, knowingly—
<br>
<br>(A) exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the trade of any MTCR equipment or technology that contributes to the acquisition, design, development, or production of missiles in a country that is not an MTCR adherent and would be, if it were United States-origin equipment or technology, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States under this chapter,
<br>
<br>(B) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or
<br>
<br>(C) facilitates such export, transfer, or trade by any other person,
<br>
<br>or if the President has made a determination with respect to a foreign person under section 4612(b)(1) of title 50, then the President shall impose on that foreign person the applicable sanctions under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(2) The sanctions which apply to a foreign person under paragraph (1) are the following:
<br>
<br>(A) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny, for a period of 2 years—
<br>
<br>(i) United States Government contracts relating to missile equipment or technology; and
<br>
<br>(ii) licenses for the transfer to such foreign person of missile equipment or technology controlled under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(B) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is within category I of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny, for a period of not less than 2 years—
<br>
<br>(i) all United States Government contracts with such foreign person; and
<br>
<br>(ii) licenses for the transfer to such foreign person of all items on the United States Munitions List.
<br>
<br>(C) If, in addition to actions taken under subparagraphs (A) and (B), the President determines that the export, transfer, or trade has substantially contributed to the design, development, or production of missiles in a country that is not an MTCR adherent, then the President shall prohibit, for a period of not less than 2 years, the importation into the United States of products produced by that foreign person.
<br>(b) Inapplicability with respect to MTCR adherents
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), subsection (a) does not apply with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) any export, transfer, or trading activity that is authorized by the laws of an MTCR adherent, if such authorization is not obtained by misrepresentation or fraud; or
<br>
<br>(B) any export, transfer, or trade of an item to an end user in a country that is an MTCR adherent.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), subsection (a) shall apply to an entity subordinate to a government that engages in exports or transfers described in section 2295a(b)(3)(A) of this title.
<br>(c) Effect of enforcement actions by MTCR adherents
<br>
<br>Sanctions set forth in subsection (a) may not be imposed under this section on a person with respect to acts described in such subsection or, if such sanctions are in effect against a person on account of such acts, such sanctions shall be terminated, if an MTCR adherent is taking judicial or other enforcement action against that person with respect to such acts, or that person has been found by the government of an MTCR adherent to be innocent of wrongdoing with respect to such acts, and if the President certifies to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives that—
<br>
<br>(1) for any judicial or other enforcement action taken by the MTCR adherent, such action has—
<br>
<br>(A) been comprehensive; and
<br>
<br>(B) been performed to the satisfaction of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) with respect to any finding of innocence of wrongdoing, the United States is satisfied with the basis for such finding.
<br>(d) Advisory opinions
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce, may, upon the request of any person, issue an advisory opinion to that person as to whether a proposed activity by that person would subject that person to sanctions under this section. Any person who relies in good faith on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity would not subject a person to such sanctions, and any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such sanctions on account of such activity.
<br>(e) Waiver and report to Congress
<br>
<br>(1) In any case other than one in which an advisory opinion has been issued under subsection (d) stating that a proposed activity would not subject a person to sanctions under this section, the President may waive the application of subsection (a) to a foreign person if the President determines that such waiver is essential to the national security of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) In the event that the President decides to apply the waiver described in paragraph (1), the President shall so notify the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives not less than 45 working days before issuing the waiver. Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led the President to apply the waiver.
<br>(f) Presumption
<br>
<br>In determining whether to apply sanctions under subsection (a) to a foreign person involved in the export, transfer, or trade of an item on the MTCR Annex, it should be a rebuttable presumption that such item is designed for use in a missile listed in the MTCR Annex if the President determines that the final destination of the item is a country the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of 4605(j)(1)(A) 2 of title 50, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
<br>(g) Additional waiver
<br>
<br>The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) on a person with respect to a product or service if the President certifies to the Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the product or service is essential to the national security of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or service, the product or service is not available from any alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved manufacturing processes or technological developments.
<br>(h) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The President shall not apply the sanction under this section prohibiting the importation of the products of a foreign person—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of procurement of defense articles or defense services—
<br>
<br>(A) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy requirements essential to the national security of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) if the President determines that the person to which the sanctions would be applied is a sole source supplier of the defense articles and services, that the defense articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States, and that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available; or
<br>
<br>(C) if the President determines that such articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States under defense coproduction agreements or NATO Programs of Cooperation;
<br>
<br>(2) to products or services provided under contracts entered into before the date on which the President publishes his intention to impose the sanctions; or
<br>
<br>(3) to—
<br>
<br>(A) spare parts,
<br>
<br>(B) component parts, but not finished products, essential to United States products or production,
<br>
<br>(C) routine services and maintenance of products, to the extent that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available, or
<br>
<br>(D) information and technology essential to United States products or production.

<br>
<br>"(2) Reporting requirement.—Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 25, 1999], the President shall submit both a classified and unclassified report to the appropriate congressional committees listing those Indian and Pakistani entities whose activities contribute to missile programs or weapons of mass destruction programs.

<br>§2801. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(a) international expositions, when properly organized, financed, and executed, have a significant impact on the economic growth of the region surrounding the exposition and, under appropriate international sanction, are important instruments of national policy, particularly in the exchange of ideas and the demonstration of cultural achievements between peoples;
<br>
<br>(b) in view of the widely varying circumstances under which international expositions have developed in the United States, the different degrees to which the Federal Government has assisted and participated in such expositions, and the increasing number of proposals for future expositions, the national interest requires that Federal action concerning such expositions be given orderly consideration; and
<br>
<br>(c) such orderly consideration is best achieved by the development of uniform standards, criteria, and procedures to establish the conditions under which the Government hereafter will (A) recognize international expositions proposed to be held in the United States, and (B) take part in such expositions.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 91–269, §1, May 27, 1970, 84 Stat. 271.)
<br>§2802. Federal recognition
<br>(a) Eligibility requirements
<br>
<br>Any international exposition proposed to be held in the United States shall be eligible on application from its sponsors to receive the recognition of the Federal Government upon a finding of the President that recognition will be in the national interest. In making such a finding the President shall consider—
<br>
<br>(1) a report by the Secretary of Commerce which shall include (A) an evaluation of purposes and reasons for the exposition, and (B) a determination that guaranteed financial and other support has been secured by the exposition from affected State and local governments and from business and civic leadership of the region and others in amounts sufficient in his judgment to assure the successful development and progress of the exposition;
<br>
<br>(2) a report by the Secretary of State that the proposed exposition qualifies for consideration of registration by the Bureau of International Expositions (hereafter referred to as BIE); and
<br>
<br>(3) such other evidence as the President may consider to be appropriate.
<br>(b) Recognition and registration procedure; compliance with international convention; participation by States and foreign governments
<br>
<br>Upon a finding by the President that an international exposition is eligible for Federal recognition, the President may take such measures recognizing the exposition as he deems proper, including, but not limited to—
<br>
<br>(1) presenting of an official request by the United States for registration of the exposition by the BIE;
<br>
<br>(2) providing for fulfillment of the requirements of the Convention of November 22, 1928, as amended, relating to international expositions; and
<br>
<br>(3) extending invitations, by proclamation or by such other manner he deems proper, to the several States of the Union and to foreign governments to take part in the exposition, provided that he shall not extend such an invitation until he has been notified officially of BIE registration for the exposition.
<br>(c) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>The President shall report his actions under this section promptly to the Congress.
