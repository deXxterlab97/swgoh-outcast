<br>
<br>(B) ensure that teachers and families of the children participate, on an equitable basis, in services and activities developed pursuant to section 6318 of this title.
<br>(2) Secular, neutral, nonideological
<br>
<br>Such educational services or other benefits, including materials and equipment, shall be secular, neutral, and nonideological.
<br>(3) Equity

<br>
<br>Educational services and other benefits for such private school children shall be equitable in comparison to services and other benefits for public school children participating under this part, and shall be provided in a timely manner.
<br>(B) Ombudsman
<br>
<br>To help ensure such equity for such private school children, teachers, and other educational personnel, the State educational agency involved shall designate an ombudsman to monitor and enforce the requirements of this part.
<br>(4) Expenditures
<br>(A) Determination
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Expenditures for educational services and other benefits to eligible private school children shall be equal to the proportion of funds allocated to participating school attendance areas based on the number of children from low-income families who attend private schools.
<br>(ii) Proportional share
<br>
<br>The proportional share of funds shall be determined based on the total amount of funds received by the local educational agency under this part prior to any allowable expenditures or transfers by the local educational agency.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>To ensure timely and meaningful consultation, a local educational agency shall consult with appropriate private school officials during the design and development of such agency's programs under this part. Such agency and private school officials shall both have the goal of reaching agreement on how to provide equitable and effective programs for eligible private school children, the results of which agreement shall be transmitted to the ombudsman designated under subsection (a)(3)(B). Such process shall include consultation on issues such as—
<br>
<br>(A) how the children's needs will be identified;
<br>
<br>(B) what services will be offered;
<br>
<br>(C) how, where, and by whom the services will be provided;
<br>
<br>(D) how the services will be academically assessed and how the results of that assessment will be used to improve those services;
<br>
<br>(E) the size and scope of the equitable services to be provided to the eligible private school children, the proportion of funds that is allocated under subsection (a)(4)(A) for such services, and how that proportion of funds is determined;

<br>
<br>(I) whether the agency shall provide services directly or through a separate government agency, consortium, entity, or third-party contractor;

<br>(ii) in the agency's participating school attendance area who attend private schools with the proportion of funds allocated under subsection (a)(4)(A) based on the number of children from low-income families who attend private schools;
<br>
<br>(K) when, including the approximate time of day, services will be provided; and
<br>
<br>(L) whether to consolidate and use funds provided under subsection (a)(4) in coordination with eligible funds available for services to private school children under applicable programs, as defined in section 7881(b)(1) of this title 1 to provide services to eligible private school children participating in programs.

<br>(5) Documentation
<br>
<br>Each local educational agency shall maintain in the agency's records and provide to the State educational agency involved a written affirmation signed by officials of each participating private school that the meaningful consultation required by this section has occurred. The written affirmation shall provide the option for private school officials to indicate such officials' belief that timely and meaningful consultation has not occurred or that the program design is not equitable with respect to eligible private school children. If such officials do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the local educational agency shall forward the documentation that such consultation has, or attempts at such consultation have, taken place to the State educational agency.
<br>(6) Compliance
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A private school official shall have the right to file a complaint with the State educational agency asserting that the local educational agency did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official, or did not make a decision that treats the private school students equitably as required by this section.

<br>
<br>If the private school official wishes to file a complaint, the official shall provide the basis of the noncompliance with this section by the local educational agency to the State educational agency, and the local educational agency shall forward the appropriate documentation to the State educational agency.
<br>(C) State educational agencies
<br>
<br>A State educational agency shall provide services under this section directly or through contracts with public or private agencies, organizations, or institutions, if the appropriate private school officials have—
<br>
<br>(i) requested that the State educational agency provide such services directly; and
<br>
<br>(ii) demonstrated that the local educational agency involved has not met the requirements of this section in accordance with the procedures for making such a request, as prescribed by the State educational agency.
<br>(c) Allocation for equitable service to private school students
<br>(1) Calculation
<br>
<br>A local educational agency shall have the final authority, consistent with this section, to calculate the number of children, ages 5 through 17, who are from low-income families and attend private schools by—
<br>
<br>(A) using the same measure of low income used to count public school children;
<br>
<br>(B) using the results of a survey that, to the extent possible, protects the identity of families of private school students, and allowing such survey results to be extrapolated if complete actual data are unavailable;
<br>
<br>(C) applying the low-income percentage of each participating public school attendance area, determined pursuant to this section, to the number of private school children who reside in that school attendance area; or
<br>
<br>(D) using an equated measure of low income correlated with the measure of low income used to count public school children.
<br>(2) Complaint process
<br>
<br>Any dispute regarding low-income data for private school students shall be subject to the complaint process authorized in section 7883 of this title.
<br>(d) Public control of funds

<br>(2) Provision of services
<br>(A) Provider
<br>
<br>The provision of services under this section shall be provided—
<br>
<br>(i) by employees of a public agency; or
<br>
<br>(ii) through contract by such public agency with an individual, association, agency, or organization.
<br>(B) Requirement
<br>
<br>In the provision of such services, such employee, individual, association, agency, or organization shall be independent of such private school and of any religious organization, and such employment or contract shall be under the control and supervision of such public agency.
<br>(e) Standards for a bypass
<br>
<br>If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in programs on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) waive the requirements of this section for such local educational agency;
<br>
<br>(2) arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section and sections 7883 and 7884 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) in making the determination under this subsection, consider one or more factors, including the quality, size, scope, and location of the program and the opportunity of eligible children to participate.

<br>(v) If a small local educational agency is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency under clause (iii)(II), it may appeal that determination to the Secretary, who shall respond not later than 45 days after receipt of such appeal.
<br>
<br>(vi) As used in this subparagraph—
<br>
<br>(I) the term "large local educational agency" means a local educational agency serving an area with a total population of 20,000 or more; and
<br>
<br>(II) the term "small local educational agency" means a local educational agency serving an area with a total population of less than 20,000.
<br>(3) Allocations to counties
<br>(A) Calculation
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year to which this paragraph applies, the Secretary shall calculate grants under this section on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.
<br>(B) Direct allocations
<br>
<br>In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, or for which the State believes it has data that would better target funds than allocating them by county, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority to make the allocations under this subpart for a particular fiscal year directly to local educational agencies without regard to counties.
<br>(C) Allocations to local educational agencies
<br>
<br>If the Secretary approves the State educational agency's application under subparagraph (B), the State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that such allocations shall be made—
<br>
<br>(i) using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this subpart; or
<br>
<br>(ii) using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.
<br>(D) Appeal
<br>
<br>The State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that it will establish a procedure through which a local educational agency that is dissatisfied with its determinations under subparagraph (B) may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination.
<br>(4) Puerto Rico
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year, the grant that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this section shall be the amount determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to subparagraph (B), the percentage that the average per-pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per-pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) 32 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.
<br>(B) Minimum percentage
<br>
<br>The percentage in subparagraph (A)(i) shall not be less than—
<br>
<br>(i) for fiscal year 2002, 77.5 percent;
<br>
<br>(ii) for fiscal year 2003, 80.0 percent;
<br>
<br>(iii) for fiscal year 2004, 82.5 percent;
<br>
<br>(iv) for fiscal year 2005, 85.0 percent;
<br>
<br>(v) for fiscal year 2006, 92.5 percent; and
<br>
<br>(vi) for fiscal year 2007 and succeeding fiscal years, 100.0 percent.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>If the application of subparagraph (B) would result in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia receiving less under this subpart than it received under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, the percentage in subparagraph (A) shall be the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) the percentage in subparagraph (A)(i);
<br>
<br>(ii) the percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for the preceding fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the percentage used for the preceding fiscal year.
<br>(b) Minimum number of children to qualify
<br>
<br>A local educational agency is eligible for a basic grant under this section for any fiscal year only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) for that agency is both—
<br>
<br>(1) 10 or more; and
<br>
<br>(2) more than 2 percent of the total school-age population in the agency's jurisdiction.
<br>(c) Children to be counted
<br>(1) Categories of children
<br>
<br>The number of children to be counted for purposes of this section is the aggregate of—
<br>
<br>(A) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency from families below the poverty level as determined under paragraph (2);
<br>
<br>(B) the number of children (determined under paragraph (4) for either the preceding year as described in that paragraph, or for the second preceding year, as the Secretary finds appropriate) aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency in institutions for neglected and delinquent children (other than such institutions operated by the United States), but not counted pursuant to subpart 1 of part D for the purposes of a grant to a State agency, or being supported in foster homes with public funds; and
<br>
<br>(C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (4).
<br>(2) Determination of number of children
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. The District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.
<br>(3) Population updates
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that the use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable. If appropriate and reliable data are not available annually, the Secretary shall use data which are updated every 2 years.
<br>(B) Inappropriate or unreliable data
<br>
<br>If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in subparagraph (A) are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce shall publicly disclose their reasons.
<br>(C) Criteria of poverty
<br>
<br>In determining the families that are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>(4) Other children to be counted
<br>
<br>(A) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of four in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children aged 5 through 17 living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination.
<br>
<br>(C) Except for the data on children living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.
<br>
<br>(D) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.
<br>(5) Estimate
<br>
<br>When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under paragraph (1)(A)) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information.
<br>(d) State minimum
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 6332 of this title, the aggregate amount allotted for all local educational agencies within a State may not be less than the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(1) 0.25 percent of the total amount allocated to States under this section for fiscal year 2001, plus 0.35 percent of the total amount allocated to States under this section in excess of the amount allocated for fiscal year 2001; or
<br>
<br>(2) the average of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount calculated in paragraph (1), above; and
<br>
<br>(B) the number of children in such State counted under subsection (c) in the fiscal year multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per-pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.

<br>The effort factor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be equal to the lowest effort factor calculated under subparagraph (A) for any State.
<br>(3) Equity factor
<br>(A) Determination
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the equity factor under this section for each State in accordance with clause (ii).
<br>(ii) Computation
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>For each State, the Secretary shall compute a weighted coefficient of variation for the per-pupil expenditures of local educational agencies in accordance with subclauses (II), (III), and (IV).
<br>(II) Variation
<br>
<br>In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall weigh the variation between per-pupil expenditures in each local educational agency and the average per-pupil expenditures in the State according to the number of pupils served by the local educational agency.
<br>(III) Number of pupils
<br>
<br>In determining the number of pupils under this paragraph served by each local educational agency and in each State, the Secretary shall multiply the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title by a factor of 1.4.
<br>(IV) Enrollment requirement
<br>
<br>In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall include only those local educational agencies with an enrollment of more than 200 students.
<br>(B) Special rule
<br>
<br>The equity factor for a State that meets the disparity standard described in section 222.162 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations (as such section was in effect on the day preceding January 8, 2002) or a State with only one local educational agency shall be not greater than 0.10.
<br>(c) Use of funds; eligibility of local educational agencies
<br>
<br>All funds awarded to each State under this section shall be allocated to local educational agencies under the following provisions. Within local educational agencies, funds allocated under this section shall be distributed to schools on a basis consistent with section 6313 of this title, and may only be used to carry out activities under this part. A local educational agency in a State is eligible to receive a targeted grant under this section for any fiscal year if—
<br>
<br>(1) the number of children in the local educational agency counted under section 6333(c) of this title, before application of the weighted child count described in paragraph (3),1 is at least 10; and
<br>
<br>(2) if the number of children counted for grants under section 6333(c) of this title, before application of the weighted child count described in paragraph (3),1 is at least 5 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency.
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year for which the Secretary allocates funds under this section on the basis of counties, funds made available as a result of applying this subsection shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.
<br>(d) Allocation of funds to eligible local educational agencies
<br>
<br>Funds received by States under this section shall be allocated within States to eligible local educational agencies on the basis of weighted child counts calculated in accordance with paragraph (1), (2), or (3), as appropriate for each State.
<br>(1) States with an equity factor less than .10
<br>
<br>In States with an equity factor less than .10, the weighted child counts referred to in subsection (d) shall be calculated as follows:
<br>(A) Weights for allocations to counties
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year for which the Secretary uses county population data to calculate grants, the weighted child count used to determine a county's allocation under this section is the larger of the two amounts determined under clauses (ii) and (iii).
<br>(ii) By percentage of children
<br>
<br>The amount referred to in clause (i) is determined by adding—
<br>
<br>(I) the number of children determined under section 6333(c) of this title for that county who constitute not more than 15.00 percent, inclusive, of the county's total population aged 5 to 17, inclusive, multiplied by 1.0;
<br>
<br>(II) the number of such children who constitute more than 15.00 percent, but not more than 19.00 percent, of such population, multiplied by 1.75;
<br>
<br>(III) the number of such children who constitute more than 19.00 percent, but not more than 24.20 percent, of such population, multiplied by 2.5;
<br>
<br>(IV) the number of such children who constitute more than 24.20 percent, but not more than 29.20 percent, of such population, multiplied by 3.25; and
<br>
<br>(V) the number of such children who constitute more than 29.20 percent of such population, multiplied by 4.0.
<br>(iii) By number of children
<br>
<br>The amount referred to in clause (i) is determined by adding
<br>
<br>(I) the number of children determined under section 6333(c) of this title who constitute not more than 2,311, inclusive, of the county's total population aged 5 to 17, inclusive, multiplied by 1.0;
<br>
<br>(II) the number of such children between 2,312 and 7,913, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 1.5;
<br>
<br>(III) the number of such children between 7,914 and 23,917, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 2.0;
<br>
<br>(IV) the number of such children between 23,918 and 93,810, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 2.5; and
<br>
<br>(V) the number of such children in excess of 93,811 in such population, multiplied by 3.0.
<br>(B) Weights for allocations to local educational agencies
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year for which the Secretary uses local educational agency data, the weighted child count used to determine a local educational agency's grant under this section is the larger of the two amounts determined under clauses (ii) and (iii).
<br>(ii) By percentage of children
<br>
<br>The amount referred to in clause (i) is determined by adding—
<br>
<br>(I) the number of children determined under section 6333(c) of this title for that local educational agency who constitute not more than 15.58 percent, inclusive, of the agency's total population aged 5 to 17, inclusive, multiplied by 1.0;
<br>
<br>(II) the number of such children who constitute more than 15.58 percent, but not more than 22.11 percent, of such population, multiplied by 1.75;
<br>
<br>(III) the number of such children who constitute more than 22.11 percent, but not more than 30.16 percent, of such population, multiplied by 2.5;
<br>
<br>(IV) the number of such children who constitute more than 30.16 percent, but not more than 38.24 percent, of such population, multiplied by 3.25; and
<br>
<br>(V) the number of such children who constitute more than 38.24 percent of such population, multiplied by 4.0.
<br>(iii) By number of children
<br>
<br>The amount referred to in clause (i) is determined by adding—
<br>
<br>(I) the number of children determined under section 6333(c) of this title who constitute not more than 691, inclusive, of the agency's total population aged 5 to 17, inclusive, multiplied by 1.0;
<br>
<br>(II) the number of such children between 692 and 2,262, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 1.5;
<br>
<br>(III) the number of such children between 2,263 and 7,851, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 2.0;
