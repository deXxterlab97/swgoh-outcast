<br>Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, May 3, 2010, 75 F.R. 24781, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Education[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Administrator of the Small Business Administration[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the Director of the National Economic Council
<br>
<br>My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.
<br>
<br>NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still affect families and communities along Florida's "Space Coast."
<br>
<br>Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development action plan by August 15, 2010.
<br>
<br>To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development. There is established a Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development (Task Force) to develop, in collaboration with local stakeholders, an interagency action plan to facilitate economic development strategies and plans along the Space Coast and to provide training and other opportunities for affected aerospace workers so they are equipped to contribute to new developments in America's space program and related industries. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.
<br>
<br>(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary of Defense;
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary of Labor;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;
<br>
<br>(iv) the Secretary of Transportation;
<br>
<br>(v) the Secretary of Education;
<br>
<br>(vi) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
<br>
<br>(vii) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;

<br>(d) identifies areas of collaboration with other public or nongovernmental actors to achieve the objectives of the Task Force; and
<br>
<br>(e) details a coordinated implementation strategy by executive departments and agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Termination. The Task Force shall terminate 3 years after the date of this memorandum unless extended by the President.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expense for participating in the Task Force; and
<br>
<br>(b) nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
