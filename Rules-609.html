<br>
<br>(C) The Administrator may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be imposed under this subsection.

<br>
<br>(3) Any person who requested in accordance with paragraph (2)(A) a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty may file a petition for judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business.

<br>(A) after the order making the assessment has become a final order and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (3), or
<br>
<br>(B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (3) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,
<br>

<br>(d) Exceptions
<br>(1) No preemption of statutes and administrative actions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendment made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, or scientific assessment implemented pursuant to this chapter, shall affect the right of a State or a political subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, scientific assessment, or any other protection for public health or the environment that—
<br>
<br>(i) is adopted or authorized under the authority of any other Federal law or adopted to satisfy or obtain authorization or approval under any other Federal law;
<br>
<br>(ii) implements a reporting, monitoring, or other information obligation for the chemical substance not otherwise required by the Administrator under this chapter or required under any other Federal law;
<br>
<br>(iii) is adopted pursuant to authority under a law of the State or political subdivision of the State related to water quality, air quality, or waste treatment or disposal, except to the extent that the action—
<br>
<br>(I) imposes a restriction on the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance; and
<br>
<br>(II)(aa) addresses the same hazards and exposures, with respect to the same conditions of use as are included in the scope of the risk evaluation published pursuant to section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title, but is inconsistent with the action of the Administrator; or
<br>
<br>(bb) would cause a violation of the applicable action by the Administrator under section 2604 or 2605 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(iv) subject to subparagraph (B), is identical to a requirement prescribed by the Administrator.
<br>(B) Identical requirements

<br>(ii) Penalties
<br>
<br>In the case of an identical requirement—
<br>
<br>(I) a State or political subdivision of a State may not assess a penalty for a specific violation for which the Administrator has assessed an adequate penalty under section 2615 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(II) if a State or political subdivision of a State has assessed a penalty for a specific violation, the Administrator may not assess a penalty for that violation in an amount that would cause the total of the penalties assessed for the violation by the State or political subdivision of a State and the Administrator combined to exceed the maximum amount that may be assessed for that violation by the Administrator under section 2615 of this title.
<br>(2) Applicability to certain rules or orders
<br>(A) Prior rules and orders
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect under this section, as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Frank R.

<br>
<br>(B) be construed to preempt or otherwise affect any action taken pursuant to a State law that was in effect on August 31, 2003.
<br>(2) Effect of subsection
<br>
<br>This subsection does not affect, modify, or alter the relationship between Federal law and laws of a State or political subdivision of a State pursuant to any other Federal law.
<br>(f) Waivers
<br>(1) Discretionary exemptions
<br>
<br>Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Administrator may, by rule, exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as may be prescribed in the rule, a statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action of that State or political subdivision of the State that relates to the effects of exposure to a chemical substance under the conditions of use if the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) compelling conditions warrant granting the waiver to protect health or the environment;

<br>
<br>(C) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not cause a violation of any applicable Federal law, rule, or order; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) consistent with the best available science;
<br>
<br>(ii) using supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and
<br>
<br>(iii) based on the weight of the scientific evidence.
<br>(2) Required exemptions
<br>
<br>Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Administrator shall exempt from subsection (b) a statute or administrative action of a State or political subdivision of a State that relates to the effects of exposure to a chemical substance under the conditions of use if the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not unduly burden interstate commerce in the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance;
<br>
<br>(ii) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not cause a violation of any applicable Federal law, rule, or order; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the State or political subdivision of the State has a concern about the chemical substance or use of the chemical substance based in peer-reviewed science; or
<br>
<br>(B) no later than the date that is 18 months after the date on which the Administrator has initiated the prioritization process for a chemical substance under the rule promulgated pursuant to section 2605(b)(1)(A) of this title, or the date on which the Administrator publishes the scope of the risk evaluation for a chemical substance under section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title, whichever is sooner, the State or political subdivision of the State has enacted a statute or proposed or finalized an administrative action intended to prohibit or otherwise restrict the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of the chemical substance.
<br>(3) Determination of a waiver request
<br>
<br>The duty of the Administrator to grant or deny a waiver application shall be nondelegable and shall be exercised—
<br>
<br>(A) not later than 180 days after the date on which an application under paragraph (1) is submitted; and
<br>
<br>(B) not later than 110 days after the date on which an application under paragraph (2) is submitted.
<br>(4) Failure to make a determination
<br>
<br>If the Administrator fails to make a determination under paragraph (3)(B) during the 110-day period beginning on the date on which an application under paragraph (2) is submitted, the statute or administrative action of the State or political subdivision of the State that was the subject of the application shall not be considered to be an existing statute or administrative action for purposes of subsection (b) by reason of the failure of the Administrator to make a determination.
<br>(5) Notice and comment
<br>
<br>Except in the case of an application approved under paragraph (9), the application of a State or political subdivision of a State under this subsection shall be subject to public notice and comment.
<br>(6) Final agency action
<br>
<br>The decision of the Administrator on the application of a State or political subdivision of a State shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) considered to be a final agency action; and
<br>
<br>(B) subject to judicial review.
<br>(7) Duration of waivers
<br>
<br>A waiver granted under paragraph (2) or approved under paragraph (9) shall remain in effect until such time as the Administrator publishes the risk evaluation under section 2605(b) of this title.
<br>(8) Judicial review of waivers
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Administrator makes a determination on an application of a State or political subdivision of a State under paragraph (1) or (2), any person may file a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the determination.
<br>(9) Approval
<br>(A) Automatic approval
<br>
<br>If the Administrator fails to meet the deadline established under paragraph (3)(B), the application of a State or political subdivision of a State under paragraph (2) shall be automatically approved, effective on the date that is 10 days after the deadline.
<br>(B) Requirements
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (6), approval of a waiver application under subparagraph (A) for failure to meet the deadline under paragraph (3)(B) shall not be considered final agency action or be subject to judicial review or public notice and comment.
<br>(g) Savings

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendment made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any standard, rule, requirement, standard of performance, risk evaluation, or scientific assessment implemented pursuant to this chapter, shall be construed to preempt, displace, or supplant any State or Federal common law rights or any State or Federal statute creating a remedy for civil relief, including those for civil damage, or a penalty for a criminal conduct.
<br>(B) Clarification of no preemption
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, nothing in this chapter, nor any amendments made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, shall preempt or preclude any cause of action for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, or other injury based on negligence, strict liability, products liability, failure to warn, or any other legal theory of liability under any State law, maritime law, or Federal common law or statutory theory.
<br>(2) No effect on private remedies
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendments made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any rules, regulations, requirements, risk evaluations, scientific assessments, or orders issued pursuant to this chapter shall be interpreted as, in either the plaintiff's or defendant's favor, dispositive in any civil action.
<br>(B) Authority of courts
<br>
<br>This chapter does not affect the authority of any court to make a determination in an adjudicatory proceeding under applicable State or Federal law with respect to the admission into evidence or any other use of this chapter or rules, regulations, requirements, standards of performance, risk evaluations, scientific assessments, or orders issued pursuant to this chapter.

<br>§2620. Citizens' petitions
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Any person may petition the Administrator to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule under section 2603, 2605, or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) or (f) of this title.
<br>(b) Procedures
<br>
<br>(1) Such petition shall be filed in the principal office of the Administrator and shall set forth the facts which it is claimed establish that it is necessary to issue, amend, or repeal a rule under section 2603, 2605, or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) or (f) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The Administrator may hold a public hearing or may conduct such investigation or proceeding as the Administrator deems appropriate in order to determine whether or not such petition should be granted.
<br>
<br>(3) Within 90 days after filing of a petition described in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall either grant or deny the petition. If the Administrator grants such petition, the Administrator shall promptly commence an appropriate proceeding in accordance with section 2603, 2604, 2605, or 2607 of this title. If the Administrator denies such petition, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the Administrator's reasons for such denial.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If the Administrator denies a petition filed under this section (or if the Administrator fails to grant or deny such petition within the 90-day period) the petitioner may commence a civil action in a district court of the United States to compel the Administrator to initiate a rulemaking proceeding as requested in the petition. Any such action shall be filed within 60 days after the Administrator's denial of the petition or, if the Administrator fails to grant or deny the petition within 90 days after filing the petition, within 60 days after the expiration of the 90-day period.
<br>
<br>(B) In an action under subparagraph (A) respecting a petition to initiate a proceeding to issue a rule under section 2603, 2605, or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) or (f) of this title, the petitioner shall be provided an opportunity to have such petition considered by the court in a de novo proceeding. If the petitioner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court by a preponderance of the evidence that—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a petition to initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under section 2603 of this title or an order under section 2603 or 2604(e) of this title—
<br>
<br>(I) information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the chemical substance to be subject to such rule or order; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the absence of such information, the substance may present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment, or the substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities and it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to it; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a petition to initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rule under section 2605(a) or 2607 of this title or an order under section 2604(f) of this title, the chemical substance or mixture to be subject to such rule or order presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, under the conditions of use.1
<br>
<br>the court shall order the Administrator to initiate the action requested by the petitioner. If the court finds that the extent of the risk to health or the environment alleged by the petitioner is less than the extent of risks to health or the environment with respect to which the Administrator is taking action under this chapter and there are insufficient resources available to the Administrator to take the action requested by the petitioner, the court may permit the Administrator to defer initiating the action requested by the petitioner until such time as the court prescribes.
<br>
<br>(C) The court in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subparagraph (A) may award costs of suit and reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses if the court determines that such an award is appropriate. Any court, in issuing its decision in an action brought to review such an order, may award costs of suit and reasonable fees for attorneys if the court determines that such an award is appropriate.
<br>
<br>(5) The remedies under this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other remedies provided by law.

<br>§2622. Employee protection
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>No employer may discharge any employee or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to a request of the employee) has—
<br>
<br>(1) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(2) testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding; or
<br>
<br>(3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or participate in any manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(b) Remedy
<br>
<br>(1) Any employee who believes that the employee has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) of this section may, within 30 days after such alleged violation occurs, file (or have any person file on the employee's behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Secretary") alleging such discharge or discrimination. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct an investigation of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days of the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the complainant (and any person acting on behalf of the complainant) and the person alleged to have committed such violation of the results of the investigation conducted pursuant to this paragraph. Within ninety days of the receipt of such complaint the Secretary shall, unless the proceeding on the complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person alleged to have committed such violation, issue an order either providing the relief prescribed by subparagraph (B) or denying the complaint. An order of the Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and opportunity for agency hearing. The Secretary may not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a complaint without the participation and consent of the complainant.
<br>
<br>(B) If in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1) the Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) of this section has occurred, the Secretary shall order (i) the person who committed such violation to take affirmative action to abate the violation, (ii) such person to reinstate the complainant to the complainant's former position together with the compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and privileges of the complainant's employment, (iii) compensatory damages, and (iv) where appropriate, exemplary damages. If such an order issued, the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which the order was issued.
<br>(c) Review
<br>
<br>(1) Any employee or employer adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under subsection (b) may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review must be filed within sixty days from the issuance of the Secretary's order. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(2) An order of the Secretary, with respect to which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1), shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.
<br>(d) Enforcement
<br>
<br>Whenever a person has failed to comply with an order issued under subsection (b)(2), the Secretary shall file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur to enforce such order. In actions brought under this subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.
<br>(e) Exclusion
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to any employee who, acting without direction from the employee's employer (or any agent of the employer), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of this chapter.

In setting a fee under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into account the ability to pay of the person required to pay such fee and the cost to the Administrator of carrying out the activities described in this paragraph.
