<br>§636. Additional powers
<br>(a) Loans to small business concerns; allowable purposes; qualified business; restrictions and limitations
<br>
<br>The Administration is empowered to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts to make loans for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of land, material, supplies, equipment, and working capital, and to make loans to any qualified small business concern, including those owned by qualified Indian tribes, for purposes of this chapter. Such financings may be made either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis. These powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions, limitations, and provisions:
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—
<br>
<br>(A) Credit elsewhere.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—The Administrator has the authority to direct, and conduct oversight for, the methods by which lenders determine whether a borrower is able to obtain credit elsewhere. No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection if the applicant can obtain credit elsewhere. No immediate participation may be purchased unless it is shown that a deferred participation is not available; and no direct financing may be made unless it is shown that a participation is not available.
<br>
<br>(ii) Liquidity.—On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market.
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) Lending limits of lenders.—On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed the legal lending limit of the lender.

<br>
<br>(B) Reduced participation upon request.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—The guarantee percentage specified by subparagraph (A) for any loan under this subsection may be reduced upon the request of the participating lender.
<br>
<br>(ii) Prohibition.—The Administration shall not use the guarantee percentage requested by a participating lender under clause (i) as a criterion for establishing priorities in approving loan guarantee requests under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(C) Interest rate under preferred lenders program.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—The maximum interest rate for a loan guaranteed under the Preferred Lenders Program shall not exceed the maximum interest rate, as determined by the Administration, applicable to other loans guaranteed under this subsection.

<br>
<br>(iii) Preferred lenders program defined.—For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "Preferred Lenders Program" means any program established by the Administrator, as authorized under the proviso in section 634(b)(7) of this title, under which a written agreement between the lender and the Administration delegates to the lender—
<br>
<br>(I) complete authority to make and close loans with a guarantee from the Administration without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration; and
<br>
<br>(II) complete authority to service and liquidate such loans without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration for routine servicing and liquidation activities, but shall not take any actions creating an actual or apparent conflict of interest.
<br>

<br>
<br>(F) Participation in the paycheck protection program.—In an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under paragraph (36), the participation by the Administration shall be 100 percent.
<br>
<br>(3) No loan shall be made under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) if the total amount outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $3,750,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), except as provided in subparagraph (B);
<br>
<br>(B) if the total amount outstanding and committed (on a deferred basis) solely for the purposes provided in paragraph (16) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $4,500,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), of which not more than $4,000,000 may be used for working capital, supplies, or financings under paragraph (14) for export purposes; and

<br>
<br>(ii) Loans sold on secondary market.—If a loan described in clause (i) is sold on the secondary market, the amount of interest paid to a bank or other lending institution described in that clause from the earliest date of default to the date of payment of the claim shall be no more than the agreed upon rate, minus one percent.

<br>
<br>(6) All loans made under this subsection shall be of such sound value or so secured as reasonably to assure repayment: Provided, however, That—
<br>
<br>(A) for loans to assist any public or private organization or to assist any handicapped individual as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of the applicant;
<br>
<br>(B) recognizing that greater risk may be associated with loans for energy measures as provided in paragraph (12) of this subsection, factors in determining "sound value" shall include, but not be limited to, quality of the product or service; technical qualifications of the applicant or his employees; sales projections; and the financial status of the business concern: Provided further, That such status need not be as sound as that required for general loans under this subsection; and 1

<br>
<br>(11) The Administration may provide loans under this subsection to any small business concern, or to any qualified person seeking to establish such a concern when it determines that such loan will further the policies established in section 631(c) 2 of this title, with particular emphasis on the preservation or establishment of small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals or owned by low-income individuals.
