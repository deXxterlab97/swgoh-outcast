<br>(B) a position in the Senior Executive Service as a noncareer appointee (as such term is defined under section 3132(a)); or
<br>
<br>(C) a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.
<br>
<br>(3) In this section, the term "employee" has the meaning given that term in section 2105, except that such term also includes an employee described in subsection (c) of that section.
<br>
<br>(b) The Office of Personnel Management may authorize the head of an agency to pay a retention bonus to an employee if—
<br>
<br>(1) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the agency for the employee's services makes it essential to retain the employee; and
<br>
<br>(2) the agency determines that, in the absence of a retention bonus, the employee would be likely to leave—
<br>
<br>(A) the Federal service; or
<br>
<br>(B) for a different position in the Federal service under conditions described in regulations of the Office.
<br>
<br>(c) The Office may authorize the head of an agency to pay retention bonuses to a group of employees in 1 or more categories of positions in 1 or more geographic areas, subject to the requirements of subsection (b)(1) and regulations prescribed by the Office, if there is a high risk that a significant portion of employees in the group would be likely to leave in the absence of retention bonuses.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Payment of a retention bonus is contingent upon the employee entering into a written service agreement with the agency to complete a period of employment with the agency.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The agreement shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) the length of the required service period;
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the bonus;
<br>
<br>(iii) the method of payment; and
<br>
<br>(iv) other terms and conditions under which the bonus is payable, subject to the requirements of this section and regulations of the Office.
<br>
<br>(B) The terms and conditions for paying a bonus, as specified in the service agreement, shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) the conditions under which the agreement may be terminated before the agreed-upon service period has been completed; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the effect of the termination.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a written service agreement is not required if the agency pays a retention bonus in biweekly installments and sets the installment payment at the full bonus percentage rate established for the employee with no portion of the bonus deferred.
<br>
<br>(B) If an agency pays a retention bonus in accordance with subparagraph (A) and makes a determination to terminate the payments, the agency shall provide written notice to the employee of that determination. Except as provided in regulations of the Office, the employee shall continue to be paid the retention bonus through the end of the pay period in which such written notice is provided.
<br>
<br>(4) A retention bonus for an employee may not be based on any period of such service which is the basis for a recruitment or relocation bonus under section 5753.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Except as provided in subsection (f), a retention bonus, which shall be stated as a percentage of the employee's basic pay for the service period associated with the bonus, may not exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) 25 percent of the employee's basic pay if paid under subsection (b); or
<br>
<br>(B) 10 percent of an employee's basic pay if paid under subsection (c).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) A retention bonus may be paid to an employee in installments after completion of specified periods of service or in a single lump sum at the end of the full period of service required by the agreement.
<br>
<br>(B) An installment payment is derived by multiplying the amount of basic pay earned in the installment period by a percentage not to exceed the bonus percentage rate established for the employee.
<br>
<br>(C) If the installment payment percentage established for the employee is less than the bonus percentage rate established for the employee, the accrued but unpaid portion of the bonus is payable as part of the final installment payment to the employee after completion of the full service period under the terms of the service agreement.
<br>
<br>(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the bonus percentage rate established for an employee means the bonus percentage rate established for such employee in accordance with paragraph (1) or subsection (f), as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(3) A retention bonus is not part of the basic pay of an employee for any purpose.
<br>
<br>(f) Upon the request of the head of an agency, the Office may waive the limit established under subsection (e)(1) and permit the agency head to pay an otherwise eligible employee or category of employees retention bonuses of up to 50 percent of basic pay, based on a critical agency need.
<br>
<br>(g) The Office shall require that, before paying any bonuses under this section, an agency shall establish a plan for the payment of any such bonuses, subject to regulations prescribed by the Office.
<br>
<br>(h) The Office may prescribe regulations to carry out this section.

<br>
<br>(2) the agency determines that replacing the employee with another employee possessing the required qualifications and experience would be difficult; and
<br>
<br>(3) the agency determines it is in the best interest of the Government to encourage the employee to complete a specified additional period of employment with the agency in the territory or possession, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, except that the total amount of service performed in a particular territory, commonwealth, or possession under 1 or more agreements established under this section may not exceed 5 years.

<br>(3) The agreement shall describe the conditions under which the extended assignment incentive may be canceled prior to the completion of agreed-upon service period and the effect of the cancellation. The agreement shall require that if, at the time of cancellation of the incentive, the employee has received incentive payments which exceed the amount which bears the same relationship to the total amount to be paid under the agreement as the completed service period bears to the agreed-upon service period, the employee shall repay that excess amount, at a minimum, except that an employee who is involuntarily reassigned to a position stationed outside the territory, commonwealth, or possession or involuntarily separated (not for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency) may not be required to repay any excess amounts.

<br>
<br>The allowance may be paid only at the times and in the amounts authorized by the regulations prescribed under section 5903 of this title. When the agency pays direct to the uniform vendor, the head of the agency may deduct a service charge of not more than 4 percent.

<br>
<br>Sec. 302. This order, and the regulations prescribed or approved under the authority thereof, shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>§5922. General provisions
<br>
<br>(a) Notwithstanding section 5536 of this title and except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the allowances and differentials authorized by this subchapter may be granted to an employee officially stationed in a foreign area—
<br>
<br>(1) who is a citizen of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) whose rate of basic pay is fixed by statute or, without taking into consideration the allowances and differentials provided by this subchapter, is fixed by administrative action pursuant to law or is fixed administratively in conformity with rates paid by the Government for work of a comparable level of difficulty and responsibility in the continental United States.
<br>
<br>To the extent authorized by a provision of statute other than this subchapter, the allowances and differentials provided by this subchapter may be paid to an employee officially stationed in a foreign area who is not a citizen of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Allowances granted under this subchapter may be paid in advance, or advance of funds may be made therefor, through the proper disbursing official in such sums as are considered advisable in consideration of the need and the period of time during which expenditures must be made in advance by the employee. An advance of funds not subsequently covered by allowances accrued to the employee under this subchapter is recoverable by the Government by—
<br>
<br>(1) setoff against accrued pay, compensation, amount of retirement credit, or other amount due the employee from the Government; and
<br>
<br>(2) such other method as is provided by law for the recovery of amounts owing to the Government.
<br>
<br>The head of the agency concerned, under regulations of the President, may waive in whole or in part a right of recovery under this subsection, if it is shown that the recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.
<br>
<br>(c) The allowances and differentials authorized by this subchapter shall be paid under regulations prescribed by the President governing—
<br>
<br>(1) payments of the allowances and differentials and the respective rates at which the payments are made;
<br>
<br>(2) the foreign areas, the groups of positions, and the categories of employees to which the rates apply; and
<br>
<br>(3) other related matters.
<br>
<br>(d) When a quarters allowance or allowance related to education under this subchapter, or quarters furnished in Government-owned or controlled buildings under section 5912, would be furnished to an employee but for the death of the employee, such allowances or quarters may be furnished or continued for the purpose of allowing any child of the employee to complete the current school year at post or away from post notwithstanding the employee's death.
<br>
<br>(e) When an allowance related to education away from post under this subchapter would be authorized with respect to an employee but for the evacuation or authorized departure status of the post, such an allowance may be furnished or continued for the purpose of allowing any dependent children of such employee to complete the current school year.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) If an employee dies at post in a foreign area, a transfer allowance under section 5924(2)(B) may be granted to the spouse or dependents of such employee (or both) for the purpose of providing for their return to the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) A transfer allowance under this subsection may not be granted with respect to the spouse or a dependent of the employee unless, at the time of death, such spouse or dependent was residing—
<br>
<br>(A) at the employee's post of assignment; or
<br>
<br>(B) at a place, outside the United States, for which a separate maintenance allowance was being furnished under section 5924(3).
<br>
<br>(3) The President may prescribe any regulations necessary to carry out this subsection.

<br>
<br>(3) A separate maintenance allowance to assist an employee who is compelled or authorized, because of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at the employee's post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience of the Government, or who requests such an allowance because of special needs or hardship involving the employee or the employee's spouse or dependents, to meet the additional expenses of maintaining, elsewhere than at the post, the employee's spouse or dependents, or both.
<br>
<br>(4) An education allowance or payment of travel costs to assist an employee with the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred because of his service in a foreign area or foreign areas in providing adequate education for his dependents (or, to the extent education away from post is involved, official assignment to service in such area or areas), as follows:

<br>
<br>(C) In those cases in which an adequate school is available at the post of the employee, if the employee chooses to educate the dependent at a school away from post, the education allowance which includes board and room, and periodic travel between the post and the school chosen, shall not exceed the total cost to the Government of the dependent attending an adequate school at the post of the employee.
<br>
<br>(D) Allowances provided pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) may include, at the election of the employee, payment or reimbursement of the costs incurred to store baggage for the employee's dependent at or in the vicinity of the dependent's school during one trip per year by the dependent between the school and the employee's duty station, except that such payment or reimbursement may not exceed the cost that the Government would incur to transport the baggage in connection with the trip, and such payment or reimbursement shall be in lieu of transportation of the baggage.
