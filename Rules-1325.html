<br>
<br>(A) trust or restricted land located on 1 or more specific Indian reservations that are expressly identified in such law; or
<br>
<br>(B) the allotted land (or any interest relating to such land) of 1 or more specific Indian tribes expressly identified in such law, including any of the Federal laws governing the probate or determination of heirs associated with, or otherwise relating to, the land, interest in land, or other interests or assets that are owned by individuals in—
<br>
<br>(i) Five Civilized Tribes restricted fee status; or
<br>
<br>(ii) Osage Tribe restricted fee status.
<br>(3) Limitation on effect of paragraph
<br>
<br>Except to the extent that this chapter would amend or otherwise affect the application of a Federal law specified or described in paragraph (1) or (2), nothing in paragraph (2) limits the application of this chapter to trust or restricted land, interests in such land, or any other trust or restricted interests or assets.
<br>(h) Rules of interpretation
<br>
<br>In the absence of a contrary intent, and except as otherwise provided under this chapter, applicable Federal law, or a tribal probate code approved by the Secretary pursuant to section 2205 of this title, wills shall be construed as to trust and restricted land and trust personalty in accordance with the following rules:
<br>(1) Construction that will passes all property
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A will shall be construed to apply to all trust and restricted land and trust personalty which the testator owned at his death, including any such land or personalty acquired after the execution of his will.
<br>(B) Permanent improvements
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise expressly provided in the will, a devise of a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land shall be presumed to include the interest of the testator in any permanent improvements attached to the parcel of land.
<br>(C) Application and effect
<br>
<br>The provisions of this paragraph apply to a covered permanent improvement—
<br>
<br>(i) even though that covered permanent improvement is not held in trust; and
<br>
<br>(ii) without altering or otherwise affecting the non-trust status of such a covered permanent improvement.
<br>(2) Class gifts
<br>(A) No differentiation between relationship by blood and relationship by affinity
<br>
<br>Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by blood from those by affinity, such as "uncles", "aunts", "nieces", or "nephews", are construed to exclude relatives by affinity. Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by the half blood from those by the whole blood, such as "brothers", "sisters", "nieces", or "nephews", are construed to include both types of relationships.
<br>(B) Meaning of "heirs" and "next of kin", etc.; time of ascertaining class
<br>
<br>A devise of trust or restricted interest in land or an interest in trust personalty to the testator's or another designated person's "heirs", "next of kin", "relatives", or "family" shall mean those persons, including the spouse, who would be entitled to take under the provisions of this chapter for nontestamentary disposition. The class is to be ascertained as of the date of the testator's death.
<br>(C) Time for ascertaining class
<br>
<br>In construing a devise to a class other than a class described in subparagraph (B), the class shall be ascertained as of the time the devise is to take effect in enjoyment. The surviving issue of any member of the class who is then dead shall take by right of representation the share which their deceased ancestor would have taken.
<br>(3) Meaning of "die without issue" and similar phrases
<br>
<br>In any devise under this chapter,8 the words "die without issue", "die without leaving issue", "have no issue", or words of a similar import shall be construed to mean that an individual had no lineal descendants in his lifetime or at his death, and not that there will be no lineal descendants at some future time.
<br>(4) Persons born out of wedlock
<br>
<br>In construing provisions of this chapter 8 relating to lapsed and void devises, and in construing a devise to a person or persons described by relationship to the testator or to another, a person born out of wedlock shall be considered the child of the natural mother and also of the natural father.
<br>(5) Lapsed devises
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), where the testator devises or bequeaths a trust or restricted interest in land or trust personalty to the testator's grandparents or to the lineal descendent of a grandparent, and the devisee or legatee dies before the testator leaving lineal descendents, such descendents shall take the interest so devised or bequeathed per stirpes.
<br>(6) Void devises
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (5), and if the disposition shall not be otherwise expressly provided for by a tribal probate code approved under section 2205 of this title, if a devise other than a residuary devise of a trust or restricted interest in land or trust personalty fails for any reason, such interest shall become part of the residue and pass, subject to the provisions of subsection (b), to the other residuary devisees, if any, in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue.
<br>(7) Family cemetery plot
<br>
<br>If a family cemetery plot owned by the testator in trust or restricted status at his decease is not mentioned in the decedent's will, the ownership of the plot shall descend to his heirs as if he had died intestate.
<br>(i) Heirship by killing
<br>(1) Heir by killing defined
<br>
<br>As used in this subsection, "heir by killing" means any person who knowingly participates, either as a principal or as an accessory before the fact, in the willful and unlawful killing of the decedent.
<br>(2) No acquisition of property by killing
<br>
<br>Subject to any applicable Federal law relating to the devise or descent of trust or restricted land, no heir by killing shall in any way acquire any trust or restricted interests in land or interests in trust personalty as the result of the death of the decedent, but such property shall pass in accordance with this subsection.
<br>(3) Descent, distribution, and right of survivorship
<br>
<br>The heir by killing shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent as to decedent's trust or restricted interests in land or trust personalty which would have passed from the decedent or his estate to such heir—
<br>
<br>(A) under intestate succession under this section;
<br>
<br>(B) under a tribal probate code, unless otherwise provided for;
<br>
<br>(C) as the surviving spouse;
<br>
<br>(D) by devise;
<br>
<br>(E) as a reversion or a vested remainder;
<br>
<br>(F) as a survivorship interest; and
<br>
<br>(G) as a contingent remainder or executory or other future interest.
<br>(4) Joint tenants, joint owners, and joint obligees
<br>
<br>(A) Any trust or restricted land or trust personalty held by only the heir by killing and the decedent as joint tenants, joint owners, or joint obligees shall pass upon the death of the decedent to his or her estate, as if the heir by killing had predeceased the decedent.
<br>
<br>(B) As to trust or restricted land or trust personalty held jointly by 3 or more persons, including both the heir by killing and the decedent, any income which would have accrued to the heir by killing as a result of the death of the decedent shall pass to the estate of the decedent as if the heir by killing had predeceased the decedent and any surviving joint tenants.
<br>
<br>(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the decedent's trust or restricted interest in land or trust personalty that is held in a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship shall be severed from the joint tenancy as though the property held in the joint tenancy were to be severed and distributed equally among the joint tenants and the decedent's interest shall pass to his estate; the remainder of the interests shall remain in joint tenancy with right of survivorship among the surviving joint tenants.
<br>(5) Life estate for the life of another
<br>
<br>If the estate is held by a third person whose possession expires upon the death of the decedent, it shall remain in such person's hands for the period of time following the decedent's death equal to the life expectancy of the decedent but for the killing.
<br>(6) Preadjudication rule
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a person has been charged, whether by indictment, information, or otherwise by the United States, a tribe, or any State, with voluntary manslaughter or homicide in connection with a decedent's death, then any and all trust or restricted land or trust personalty that would otherwise pass to that person from the decedent's estate shall not pass or be distributed by the Secretary until the charges have been resolved in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
<br>(B) Dismissal or withdrawal
<br>
<br>Upon dismissal or withdrawal of the charge, or upon a verdict of not guilty, such land and personalty shall pass as if no charge had been filed or made.
<br>(C) Conviction
<br>
<br>Upon conviction of such person, and the exhaustion of all appeals, if any, the trust and restricted land and trust personalty in the estate shall pass in accordance with this subsection.
<br>(7) Broad construction; policy of subsection
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not be considered penal in nature, but shall be construed broadly in order to effect the policy that no person shall be allowed to profit by his own wrong, wherever committed.
<br>(j) General rules governing probate
<br>(1) Scope
<br>
<br>Except as provided under applicable Federal law or a tribal probate code approved under section 2205 of this title, the provisions of this subsection shall govern the probate of estates containing trust and restricted interests in land or trust personalty.
<br>(2) Pretermitted spouses and children
<br>(A) Spouses
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in clause (ii), if the surviving spouse of a testator married the testator after the testator executed the will of the testator, the surviving spouse shall receive the intestate share in the decedent's trust or restricted land and trust personalty that the spouse would have received if the testator had died intestate.
<br>(ii) Exception
<br>
<br>Clause (i) shall not apply to a trust or restricted interest in land where—
<br>
<br>(I) the will of a testator is executed before the date that is 1 year after the date on which the Secretary publishes a notice of certification under section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004 (25 U.S.C. 2201 note; Public Law 108–374);
<br>
<br>(II)(aa) the spouse of a testator is a non-Indian; and
<br>
<br>(bb) the testator devised the interests in trust or restricted land of the testator to 1 or more Indians;
<br>
<br>(III) it appears, based on an examination of the will or other evidence, that the will was made in contemplation of the marriage of the testator to the surviving spouse;
<br>
<br>(IV) the will expresses the intention that the will is to be effective notwithstanding any subsequent marriage; or
<br>
<br>(V)(aa) the testator provided for the spouse by a transfer of funds or property outside the will; and
<br>
<br>(bb) an intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is demonstrated by statements of the testator or through a reasonable inference based on the amount of the transfer or other evidence.
<br>(iii) Spouses married at the time of the will
<br>
<br>Should the surviving spouse of the testator be omitted from the will of the testator, the surviving spouse shall be treated, for purposes of trust or restricted land or trust personalty in the testator's estate, in accordance with subsection (a)(2)(A), as though there was no will but only if—
<br>
<br>(I) the testator and surviving spouse were continuously married without legal separation for the 5-year period preceding the decedent's death;
<br>
<br>(II) the testator and surviving spouse have a surviving child who is the child of the testator;
<br>
<br>(III) the surviving spouse has made substantial payments toward the purchase of, or improvements to, the trust or restricted land in such estate; or
<br>
<br>(IV) the surviving spouse is under a binding obligation to continue making loan payments for the trust or restricted land for a substantial period of time;
<br>
<br> except that, if there is evidence that the testator adequately provided for the surviving spouse and any minor children by a transfer of funds or property outside of the will, this clause shall not apply.
<br>(B) Children
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If a testator executed the will of the testator before the birth or adoption of 1 or more children of the testator, and the omission of the children from the will is a product of inadvertence rather than an intentional omission, the children shall share in the trust or restricted interests in land and trust personalty as if the decedent had died intestate.
<br>(ii) Adopted heirs
<br>
<br>Any person recognized as an heir by virtue of adoption under the Act of July 8, 1940 (25 U.S.C. 372a), shall be treated as the child of a decedent under this subsection.
<br>(iii) Adopted-out children
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this chapter, an adopted person shall not be considered the child or issue of his natural parents, except in distributing the estate of a natural kin, other than the natural parent, who has maintained a family relationship with the adopted person. If a natural parent shall have married the adopting parent, the adopted person for purposes of inheritance by, from and through him shall also be considered the issue of such natural parent.
<br>(II) Eligible heir pursuant to other Federal law or tribal law
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B)(iii)(I), other Federal laws and laws of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the trust or restricted interest in land may otherwise define the inheritance rights of adopted-out children.
<br>(3) Divorce
<br>(A) Surviving spouse
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>An individual who is divorced from a decedent, or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled, shall not be considered to be a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, the individual is married to the decedent at the time of death of the decedent.
<br>(ii) Separation
<br>
<br>A decree of separation that does not dissolve a marriage, and terminate the status of husband and wife, shall not be considered a divorce for the purpose of this subsection.
<br>(iii) No effect on adjudications
<br>
<br>Nothing in clause (i) shall prevent the Secretary from giving effect to a property right settlement relating to a trust or restricted interest in land or an interest in trust personalty if 1 of the parties to the settlement dies before the issuance of a final decree dissolving the marriage of the parties to the property settlement.
<br>(B) Effect of subsequent divorce on a will or devise
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If, after executing a will, a testator is divorced or the marriage of the testator is annulled, as of the effective date of the divorce or annulment, any disposition of trust or restricted interests in land or of trust personalty made by the will to the former spouse of the testator shall be considered to be revoked unless the will expressly provides otherwise.
<br>(ii) Property
<br>
<br>Property that is prevented from passing to a former spouse of a decedent under clause (i) shall pass as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent.
<br>(iii) Provisions of wills
<br>
<br>Any provision of a will that is considered to be revoked solely by operation of this subparagraph shall be revived by the remarriage of a testator to the former spouse of the testator.
<br>(4) After-born heirs
<br>
<br>A child in gestation at the time of decedent's death will be treated as having survived the decedent if the child lives at least 120 hours after its birth.
<br>(5) Advancements of trust personalty during lifetime; effect on distribution of estate
<br>
<br>(A) The trust personalty of a decedent who dies intestate as to all or a portion of his or her estate, given during the decedent's lifetime to a person eligible to be an heir of the decedent under subsection (b)(2)(B), shall be treated as an advancement against the heir's inheritance, but only if the decedent declared in a contemporaneous writing, or the heir acknowledged in writing, that the gift is an advancement or is to be taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purposes of this section, trust personalty advanced during the decedent's lifetime is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of the decedent's death, whichever occurs first.
<br>
<br>(C) If the recipient of the trust personalty predeceases the decedent, the property shall not be treated as an advancement or taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate unless the decedent's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.
<br>(6) Heirs related to decedent through 2 lines; single share
<br>
<br>A person who is related to the decedent through 2 lines of relationship is entitled to only a single share of the trust or restricted land or trust personalty in the decedent's estate based on the relationship that would entitle such person to the larger share.
<br>(7) Notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall notify each owner of trust and restricted land of the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(B) Combined notices
<br>
<br>The notice under subparagraph (A) may, at the discretion of the Secretary, be provided with the notice required under subsection (a) of section 8 of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004.
<br>(8) Renunciation or disclaimer of interests
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any person 18 years of age or older may renounce or disclaim an inheritance of a trust or restricted interest in land or in trust personalty through intestate succession or devise, either in full or subject to the reservation of a life estate (where the interest is an interest in land), in accordance with subparagraph (B), by filing a signed and acknowledged declaration with the probate decisionmaker prior to entry of a final probate order. No interest so renounced or disclaimed shall be considered to have vested in the renouncing or disclaiming heir or devisee, and the renunciation or disclaimer shall not be considered to be a transfer or gift of the renounced or disclaimed interest.
<br>(B) Eligible recipients of renounced or disclaimed interests; notice to recipients
<br>(i) Interests in land
<br>
<br>A trust or restricted interest in land may be renounced or disclaimed only in favor of—
<br>
<br>(I) an eligible heir;
<br>
<br>(II) any person who would have been eligible to be a devisee of the interest in question pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) (but only in cases where the renouncing person is a devisee of the interest under a valid will); or

<br>
<br> and the interest so renounced shall pass to its recipient in trust or restricted status.
<br>(ii) Trust personalty
<br>
<br>An interest in trust personalty may be renounced or disclaimed in favor of any person who would be eligible to be a devisee of such an interest under subsection (b)(3) and shall pass to the recipient in accordance with the provisions of that subsection.
<br>(iii) Unauthorized renunciations and disclaimers
<br>
<br>Unless renounced or disclaimed in favor of a person or Indian tribe eligible to receive the interest in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, a renounced or disclaimed interest shall pass as if the renunciation or disclaimer had not been made.
<br>(C) Acceptance of interest
<br>
<br>A renunciation or disclaimer of an interest filed in accordance with this paragraph shall be considered accepted when implemented in a final order by a decisionmaker, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. No renunciation or disclaimer of an interest shall be included in such order unless the recipient of the interest has been given notice of the renunciation or disclaimer and has not refused to accept the interest. All disclaimers and renunciations filed and implemented in probate orders made effective prior to October 27, 2004, are hereby ratified.
<br>(D) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow the renunciation of an interest that is subject to subsection (a)(2)(D) in favor of more than 1 person.
<br>(9) Consolidation agreements
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>During the pendency of probate, the decisionmaker is authorized to approve written consolidation agreements effecting exchanges or gifts voluntarily entered into between the decedent's eligible heirs or devisees, to consolidate interests in any tract of land included in the decedent's trust inventory. Such agreements may provide for the conveyance of interests already owned by such heirs or devisees in such tracts, without having to comply with the Secretary's rules and requirements otherwise applicable to conveyances by deed of trust or restricted interests in land.
<br>(B) Effective
<br>
<br>An agreement approved under subparagraph (A) shall be considered final when implemented in an order by a decisionmaker. The final probate order shall direct any changes necessary to the Secretary's land records, to reflect and implement the terms of the approved agreement.
<br>(C) Effect on purchase option at probate
<br>
<br>Any interest in trust or restricted land that is subject to a consolidation agreement under this paragraph or subsection (e) shall not be available for purchase under subsection (o) unless the decisionmaker determines that the agreement should not be approved.
<br>(k) Notification to landowners
<br>
<br>After receiving a written request by any owner of a trust or restricted interest in land, the Secretary shall provide to such landowner the following information with respect to each tract of trust or restricted land in which the landowner has an interest:
<br>
<br>(1) The location of the tract of land involved.
<br>
<br>(2) The identity of each other co-owner of interests in the parcel of land.

<br>
<br>(B) develop proposed rules, regulations, and guidelines to implement the pilot project, including—

<br>(B) Limitation
<br>
<br>The organization or activities of any entity under the pilot project shall not be construed to impair, impede, replace, abrogate, or modify in any respect the trust duties or responsibilities of the Secretary, nor shall anything in this subsection or in any rules, regulations, or guidelines developed under this subsection enable any private or family trustee of trust or restricted interests in land to exercise any powers over such interests greater than that held by the Secretary with respect to such interests.
<br>(C) Secretarial approval of transactions
<br>
<br>Any transaction involving the lease, use, mortgage or other disposition of trust or restricted land or other trust assets administered by or through an entity under the pilot project shall be subject to approval by the Secretary in accordance with applicable Federal law.

<br>(4) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>Prior to the expiration of the pilot project provided for under this subsection, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress stating—
<br>
<br>(A) a description of the Secretary's consultation with Indian tribes, individual landowner associations, Indian advocacy organizations, and other parties consulted with regarding the development of rules and regulations for the creation and management of interests in trust and restricted lands under the pilot project;

<br>
<br>(D) any recommendations that the Secretary may have regarding whether to adopt a permanent program as a management and consolidation measure for interests in trust or restricted lands.
<br>(m) Notice to heirs
<br>
<br>Prior to holding a hearing to determine the heirs to trust or restricted property, or making a decision determining such heirs, the Secretary shall seek to provide actual written notice of the proceedings to all heirs. Such efforts shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) a search of publicly available records and Federal records, including telephone and address directories and including electronic search services or directories;
<br>
<br>(2) an inquiry with family members and co-heirs of the property;
<br>
<br>(3) an inquiry with the tribal government of which the owner is a member, and the tribal government with jurisdiction over the property, if any; and

<br>(4) if the property is of a value greater than $2,000, engaging the services of an independent firm to conduct a missing persons search.
<br>(n) Missing heirs

<br>(1) For purposes of this subsection and subsection (m), an heir may be presumed missing if—
<br>
<br>(A) such heir's whereabouts remain unknown 60 days after completion of notice efforts under subsection (m); and

<br>(B) in the proceeding to determine a decedent's heirs, the Secretary finds that the heir has had no contact with other heirs of the decedent, if any, or with the Department relating to trust or restricted land or other trust assets at any time during the 6-year period preceding the hearing to determine heirs.
<br>
<br>(2) Before the date for declaring an heir missing, any person may request an extension of time to locate such heir. The Secretary shall grant a reasonable extension of time for good cause.
<br>
<br>(3) An heir shall be declared missing only after a review of the efforts made in the heirship proceeding and a finding has been made that this subsection has been complied with.
<br>
<br>(4) An heir determined to be missing pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of descent and devise of trust or restricted land and trust personalty within that decedent's estate.

<br>
<br>The trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land in the decedent's estate may be purchased at probate in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
<br>(2) Sale of interest at fair market value

<br>
<br>(ii) except as provided in paragraph (5), the heirs or devisees of such interest, and the decedent's surviving spouse, if any, receiving a life estate under subparagraph (A) or (D) of subsection (a)(2) consent to the sale.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the conditions described in subsection (b)(1), an Indian tribe receiving a fractional interest under section 2212 of this title may, as a tenant in common with the other owners of the trust or restricted lands, lease the interest, sell the resources, consent to the granting of rights-of-way, or engage in any other transaction affecting the trust or restricted land authorized by law.
<br>(b) Application of revenue from acquired interests to land consolidation program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall have a lien on any revenue accruing to an interest described in subsection (a) until the Secretary provides for the removal of the lien under paragraph (3), (4), or (5).

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Until the Secretary removes a lien from an interest in land under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(i) any lease, resource sale contract, right-of-way, or other document evidencing a transaction affecting the interest shall contain a clause providing that all revenue derived from the interest shall be paid to the Secretary; and

<br>(ii) any revenue derived from any interest acquired by the Secretary in accordance with section 2212 of this title shall be deposited in the fund created under section 2215 of this title.
<br>(B) Approval of transactions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 5123 of this title, or any other provision of law, until the Secretary removes a lien from an interest in land under paragraph (1), the Secretary may approve a transaction covered under this section on behalf of an Indian tribe.
<br>(3) Removal of liens after findings
<br>
<br>The Secretary may remove a lien referred to in paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes a finding that—
<br>
<br>(A) the costs of administering the interest from which revenue accrues under the lien will equal or exceed the projected revenues for the parcel of land involved;
<br>
<br>(B) in the discretion of the Secretary, it will take an unreasonable period of time for the parcel of land to generate revenue that equals the purchase price paid for the interest; or
<br>
<br>(C) a subsequent decrease in the value of land or commodities associated with the parcel of land make it likely that the interest will be unable to generate revenue that equals the purchase price paid for the interest in a reasonable time.
<br>(4) Removal of liens upon payment into the acquisition fund
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall remove a lien referred to in paragraph (1) upon payment of an amount equal to the purchase price of that interest in land into the Acquisition Fund created under section 2215 1 of this title, except where the tribe with jurisdiction over such interest in land authorizes the Secretary to continue the lien in order to generate additional acquisition funds.
<br>(5) Other removal of liens

<br>(c) Tribe not treated as party to lease; no effect on tribal sovereignty, immunity
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to any undivided interest in allotted land held by the Secretary in trust for a tribe if a lease or agreement under subsection (a) is otherwise applicable to such undivided interest by reason of this section even though the Indian tribe did not consent to the lease or agreement.
<br>(2) Application of lease
<br>
<br>The lease or agreement described in paragraph (1) shall apply to the portion of the undivided interest in allotted land described in such paragraph (including entitlement of the Indian tribe to payment under the lease or agreement), and the Indian tribe shall not be treated as being a party to the lease or agreement. Nothing in this section (or in the lease or agreement) shall be construed to affect the sovereignty of the Indian tribe.

<br>(ii) to an Indian co-owner or to the tribe with jurisdiction over the subject parcel of land, where the grantor owns a fractional interest that represents 5 percent or less of the parcel.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>For a period of 5 years after the Secretary approves a conveyance pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not approve an application to terminate the trust status or remove the restrictions of such an interest.

Upon such a request, the Secretary shall forthwith take such interest into trust.

<br>
<br>(A) to match any offer contained in the application; or
<br>
<br>(B) in a case in which there is no purchase price offered, to acquire the interest in the parcel by paying the fair market value of the interest.
<br>(2) Exception for family farms
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a parcel of, or interest in, trust or restricted land that is part of a family farm that is conveyed to a member of the family of a landowner (as defined in section 2205(c)(2)(A)(iv) of this title) if the conveyance requires that in the event that the parcel or interest is offered for sale to an entity or person that is not a member of the family of the landowner, the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase the interest pursuant to paragraph (1).

<br>§2219. Application to Alaska
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) numerous academic and governmental organizations have studied the nature and extent of fractionated ownership of Indian land outside of Alaska and have proposed solutions to this problem; and
<br>
<br>(2) despite these studies, there has not been a comparable effort to analyze the problem, if any, of fractionated ownership in Alaska.
<br>(b) Application of chapter to Alaska
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this section, this chapter shall not apply to land located within Alaska.
<br>(c) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a ratification of any determination by any agency, instrumentality, or court of the United States that may support the assertion of tribal jurisdiction over allotment lands or interests in such land in Alaska.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–459, title II, §220, as added Pub. L. 106–462, title I, §103(6), Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 2006.)
