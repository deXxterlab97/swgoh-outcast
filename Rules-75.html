<br>20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most of his miracles, for that they had not done penance.
<br>21	Woe to thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Beth- saida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes.
<br>22	But I say unto you, it shall be more toler- able for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.
<br>23	And thou Capharnaum, shalt thou be ex- alted up to heaven? thou shalt go down even unto hell. For if in Sodom had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in thee, perhaps it had remained unto this day.
<br>24	But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
<br>25	At that time Jesus answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to the little ones.
<br> 
<br>26	Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.
<br>27	All things are delivered to me by my Fa- ther. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Fa- ther: neither doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him.
<br>28	Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you.
<br>29	Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.
<br>30	For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>At that time Jesus went through the corn on the sabbath: and his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears, and to eat.
<br>2	And the Pharisees seeing them, said to him: Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days.
<br>3	But he said to them: Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him:
<br>4	How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were with him, but for the priests only?
<br>5	Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame?
<br>6	But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple.
<br>7	And if you knew what this meaneth: I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: you would never have condemned the innocent.
<br>8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sab- bath.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And when he has passed from thence, he came into their synagogues.
<br>10	And behold there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
<br>11	But he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that hath one sheep: and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not take hold on it and lift it up?
<br>12	How much better is a man than a sheep? Therefore it it lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days.
<br>13	Then he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.
<br>14	And the Pharisees going out made a con- sultation against him, how they might destroy him.
<br>15	But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence: and many followed him, and he healed them all. 16 And he charged them that they should not
<br>make him known.
<br>17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying:
<br>18	Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.
<br>19	He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
<br>20	The bruised reed he shall not break: and smoking flax he shall not extinguish: till he send forth judgment unto victory.
<br>21	And in his name the Gentiles shall hope.
<br>22	Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw.
<br>23	And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?
<br> 
<br>24	But the Pharisees hearing it, said: This man casteth not out the devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
<br>25	And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house di- vided against itself shall not stand.
<br>26	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is di- vided against himself: how then shall his king- dom stand?
<br>27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
<br>28	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
<br>29	Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his goods, unless he first bind the strong? and then he will rifle his house. 30 He that is not with me, is against me: and
<br>he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
<br>31	Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blas- phemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
<br>32	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
<br>33	Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree evil, and its fruit evil. For by the fruit the tree is known.
<br>34	O generation of vipers, how can you speak good things, whereas you are evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
<br>35	A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
<br>36	But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an ac- count for it in the day of judgment.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
<br>38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees an- swered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee.
<br>39	Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
<br>40	For as Jonas was in the whale’s belly three days and three nights: so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
<br>41	The men of Ninive shall rise in judg- ment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here.
<br>42	The queen of the south shall rise in judg- ment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here.
<br>43	And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.
<br>44	Then he saith: I will return into my house from whence I came out. And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
<br>45	Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man in made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation.
<br>46	As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood with- out, seeking to speak to him.
<br>47	And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.
<br>48	But he answering him that told him, said: Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?
<br> 
<br>49	And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.
<br>50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Fa- ther, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>The same day Jesus going out of the house, sat by the sea side.
<br>2	And great multitudes were gathered unto him, so that he went up into a boat and sat: and all the multitude stood on the shore.
<br>3	And he spoke to them many things in para- bles, saying: Behold the sower went forth to sow. 4 And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate them
<br>up.
<br>5	And other some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth: and they sprung up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.
<br>6	And when the sun was up they were scorched: and because they had not root, they withered away.
<br>7	And others fell among thorns: and the thorns grew up and choked them.
<br>8	And others fell upon good ground: and they brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
<br>9	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>10	And his disciples came and said to him: Why speakest thou to them in parables?
<br>11	Who answered and said to them: Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven: but to them it is not given. 12 For he that hath, to him shall be given, and he shall abound: but he that hath not, from
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him shall be taken away that also which he hath. 13 Therefore do I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not, and hearing they
<br>hear not, neither do they understand.
<br>14	And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them, who saith: By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.
<br>15	For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears they have been dull of hear- ing, and their eyes they have shut: lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
<br>16	But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.
<br>17	For, amen, I say to you, many prophets and just men have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.
<br>18	Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.
<br>19	When any one heareth the   word   of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, there cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he that re- ceived the seed by the way side.
<br>20	And he that received the seed upon stony ground, is he that heareth the word, and imme- diately receiveth it with joy.
<br>21	Yet hath he not root in himself, but is only for a time: and when there ariseth tribu- lation and persecution because of the word, he is presently scandalized.
<br>22	And he that received the seed among thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choketh up the word, and he becometh fruitless. 23 But he that received the seed upon good ground, is he that heareth the word, and under- standeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one
<br> 
<br>an hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty.
<br>24	Another parable he proposed to them, say- ing: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field.
<br>25	But while men were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way.
<br>26	And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.
<br>27	And the servants of the goodman of the house coming said to him: Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it cockle?
<br>28	And he said to them: An enemy hath done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?
<br>29	And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.
<br>30	Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.
<br>31	Another parable he proposed unto them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
<br>32	Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.
<br>33	Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.
<br>34	All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes: and without parables he did not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>speak to them.
<br>35	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
<br>36	Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying: Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.
<br>37	Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.
<br>38	And the field, is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom. And the cockle, are the children of the wicked one.
<br>39	And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil. But the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.
<br>40	Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of the world.
<br>41	The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.
<br>42	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<br>43	Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>44	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a trea- sure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and sel- leth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
<br>45	Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.
<br>46	Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.
<br>47	Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kind of fishes.
<br> 
<br>48	Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.
<br>49	So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just.
<br>50	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<br>51	Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.
<br>52	He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.
<br>53	And it came to pass: when Jesus had fin- ished these parables, he passed from thence.
<br>54	And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this man by this wisdom and miracles?
<br>55	Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:
<br>56	And his sisters, are they not all with us?
<br>Whence therefore hath he all these things?
<br>57	And they were scandalized in his regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
<br>58	And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>At the time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus.
<br>2 And he said to his servants: This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	For Herod had apprehended John and bound him, and put him into prison, because of Hero- dias, his brother’s wife.
<br>4	For John said to him: It is not lawful for thee to have her.
<br>5	And having a mind to put him to death, he feared the people: because they esteemed him as a prophet.
<br>6	But on Herod’s   birthday,   the   daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod.
<br>7	Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him.
<br>8	But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist.
<br>9	And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.
<br>10	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
<br>11	And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.
<br>12	And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and came and told Jesus.
<br>13	Which when Jesus had heard, he retired from thence by boat, into a desert place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot out of the cities.
<br>14	And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
<br>15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past: send away the multitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy them- selves victuals.
<br>16	But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give you them to eat.
<br> 
<br>17	They answered him: We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.
<br>18	He said to them: Bring them hither to me. 19 And when he had commanded the multi- tudes to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the
<br>multitudes.
<br>20	And they did all eat, and were filled. And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.
<br>21	And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women and children. 22 And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to go before him over
<br>the water, till he dismissed the people.
<br>23	And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray. And when it was evening, he was there alone.
<br>24	But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary. 25 And in the fourth watch of the night, he
<br>came to them walking upon the sea.
<br>26	And they seeing him walk upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an apparition. And they cried out for fear.
<br>27	And immediately Jesus spoke to them, say- ing: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.
<br>28	And Peter making answer, said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.
<br>29	And he said: Come. And Peter going down out of the boat, walked upon the water to come to Jesus.
<br>30	But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.
<br>31	And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>32	And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.
<br>33	And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of God.
<br>34	And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.
<br>35	And when the men of that place had knowl- edge of him, they sent into all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.
<br>36	And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment. And as many as touched, were made whole.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:
<br>2	Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
<br>3	But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?  For God said:
<br>4	Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.
<br>5	But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.
<br>6	And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the command- ment of God for your tradition.
<br>7	Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:
<br>8	This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.
<br>9	And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.
<br> 
<br>10	And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and under- stand.
<br>11	Not that which goeth into the mouth de- fileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
<br>12	Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?
<br>13	But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
<br>14	Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.
<br>15	And Peter answering, said to him: Ex- pound to us this parable.
<br>16	But he said: Are you also yet without un- derstanding?
<br>17	Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?
<br>18	But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.
<br>19	For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
<br>20	These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.
<br>21	And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
<br>22	And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.
<br>23	Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.
<br>25	But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.
<br>26	Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.
<br>27	But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.
<br>28	Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.
<br>29	And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And going up into a mountain, he sat there.
<br>30	And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:
<br>31	So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
<br>32	And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, be- cause they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
<br>33	And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?
<br>34	And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.
<br>35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.
<br>36	And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his dis- ciples, and the disciples to the people.
<br> 
<br>37	And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.
<br>38	And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.
<br>39	And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And there came to him the Pharisees and Sad- duccees tempting: and they asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.
<br>2	But he answered and said to them: When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.
<br>3	And in the morning: To day there will be a storm, for the sky is red and lowering. You know then how to discern the face of the sky: and can you not know the signs of the times?
<br>4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. And he left them, and went away.
<br>5	And when his disciples were come over the water, they had forgotten to take bread.
<br>6	Who said to them: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<br>7	But they thought within themselves, saying: Because we have taken no bread.
<br>8	And Jesus knowing it, said: Why do you think within yourselves, O ye of little faith, for that you have no bread?
<br>9	Do you not yet understand, neither do you remember the five loaves among five thousand men, and how many baskets you took up?
<br>10	Nor the seven loaves among four thousand men, and how many baskets you took up?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	Why do you not understand that it was not concerning the bread I said to you: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
<br>12	Then they understood that he said not that they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 13 And Jesus came into the quarters of Ce- sarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying:
<br>Whom do men say that the Son of man is?
<br>14	But they said: Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
<br>15	Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am?
<br>16	Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
<br>17	And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
<br>18	And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
<br>19	And I will give to thee the keys of the king- dom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven.
<br>20	Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.
<br>21	From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the ancients and scribes and chief priests, and be put to death, and the third day rise again.
<br>22	And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him, saying: Lord, be it far from thee, this shall not be unto thee.
<br>23	Who turning, said to Peter: Go behind me,
<br> 
<br>Satan, thou art a scandal unto me: because thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.
<br>24	Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
<br>25	For he that will save his life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
<br>26	For what doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his own soul? Or what exchange shall a man give for his soul?
<br>27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels: and then will he render to every man according to his works.
<br>28	Amen I say to you, there are some of them that stand here, that shall not taste death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>
<br>And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
<br>2	And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.
<br>3	And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.
<br>4	And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
<br>5	And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them.   And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.
<br>7	And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.
<br>8	And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.
<br>9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead. 10 And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come
<br>first?
<br>11	But he answering, said to them: Elias in- deed shall come, and restore all things.
<br>12	But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.
<br>13	Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.
<br>14	And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him, saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.
<br>15	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
<br>16	Then Jesus answered and said: O unbe- lieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
<br>17	And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.
<br>18	Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?
<br>19	Jesus said to them: Because of your unbe- lief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to
<br> 
<br>this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
<br>20	But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.
<br>21	And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
<br>22	And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled ex- ceedingly.
<br>23	And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that recieved the didrachmas, came to Peter and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas?
<br>24	He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children, or of strangers?
<br>25	And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.
<br>26	But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who thinkest thou is the greater in the kingdom of heaven?
<br>2	And Jesus calling unto him a little child, set him in the midst of them,
<br>3	And said: Amen I say to you, unless you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br>4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>this little child, he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.
<br>5	And he that shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me.
<br>6	But he that shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea.
<br>7	Woe to the world because of scandals. For it must needs be that scandals come: but nev- ertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh.
<br>8	And if thy hand, or thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to go into life maimed or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire.
<br>9	And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee having one eye to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
<br>10	See that you despise not one of these lit- tle ones: for I say to you, that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
<br>11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
<br>12	What think you? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray: doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go to seek that which is gone astray?
<br>13	And if it so be that he find it: Amen I say to you, he rejoiceth more for that, than for the ninety-nine that went not astray.
<br>14	Even so it is not the will of your Father, who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
<br>15	But if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone.
<br> 
<br>If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother. 16 And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: that in the mouth of two or
<br>three witnesses every word may stand.
<br>17	And if he will not hear them: tell the church. And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican.
<br>18	Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.
<br>19	Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning any thing what- soever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven.
<br>20	For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
<br>21	Then came Peter unto him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
<br>22	Jesus saith to him: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven times.
<br>23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king, who would take an account of his ser- vants.
<br>24	And when he had begun to take the ac- count, one was brought to him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
<br>25	And as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.
<br>26	But that servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
<br>27	And the lord of that servant being moved with pity, let him go and forgave him the debt.
<br>28	But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his fellow servants that owed him an
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hundred pence: and laying hold of him, throttled him, saying: Pay what thou owest.
<br>29	And his fellow servant falling down, be- sought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
<br>30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he paid the debt.
<br>31	Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done.
<br>32	Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:
<br>33	Shouldst not thou then have had compas- sion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?
<br>34	And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the debt.
<br>35	So also shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea, beyond Jordan.
<br>2	And great multitudes followed him: and he healed them there.
<br>3	And there came to him the Pharisees tempt- ing him, and saying: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
<br>4	Who answering, said to them: Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning, Made them male and female?  And he said:
<br>5	For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh.
<br>6	Therefore now they are not two, but one
<br> 
<br>flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.
<br>7	They say to him: Why then did Moses com- mand to give a bill of divorce, and to put away? 8 He saith to them: Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it
<br>was not so.
<br>9	And I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that shall marry her that is put away, com- mitteth adultery.
<br>10	His disciples say unto him: If the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry.
<br>11	Who said to them: All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given.
<br>12	For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mother’s womb: and there are eu- nuchs, who were made so by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He that can take, let him take it.
<br>13	Then were little children presented to him, that he should impose hands upon them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.
<br>14	But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the kingdom of heaven is for such.
<br>15	And when he had imposed hands upon them, he departed from thence.
<br>16	And behold one came and said to him: Good master, what good shall I do that I may have life everlasting?
<br>17	Who said to him: Why asketh thou me concerning good? One is good, God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
<br>18	He said to him: Which? And Jesus said: Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness.
<br>19	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
<br>20	The young man saith to him: All these I have kept from my youth, what is yet wanting to me?
<br>21	Jesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come follow me.
<br>22	And when the young man had heard this word, he went away sad: for he had great pos- sessions.
<br>23	Then Jesus said to his disciples: Amen, I say to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br>24	And again I say to you:   It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br>25	And when they had heard this, the disci- ples wondered very much, saying: Who then can be saved?
<br>26	And Jesus beholding, said to them: With men this is impossible: but with God all things are possible.
<br>27	Then Peter answering, said to him: Behold we have left all things, and have followed thee: what therefore shall we have?
<br>28	And Jesus said to them: Amen, I say to you, that you, who have followed me, in the re- generation, when the Son of man shall sit on the seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<br>29	And every one that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall possess life ev- erlasting.
<br> 
<br>30	And many that are first, shall be last: and the last shall be first.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labour- ers into his vineyard.
<br>2	And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
<br>3	And going about the third hour, he saw oth- ers standing in the market place idle.
<br>4	And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just. 5 And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did
<br>in like manner.
<br>6	But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?
<br>7	They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vine- yard.
<br>8	And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.
<br>9	When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
<br>10	But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.
<br>11	And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,
<br>12	Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.
<br>13	But he answering said to one of them:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
<br>14	Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.
<br>15	Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?
<br>16	So shall the last be first, and the first last.
<br>For many are called, but few chosen.
<br>17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:
<br>18	Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.
<br>19	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.
<br>20	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.
<br>21	Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
<br>22	And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.
<br>23	He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
<br>24	And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
<br>25	But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.
<br>26	It shall not be so among you: but whoso- ever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:
<br> 
<br>27	And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.
<br>28	Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.
<br>29	And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
<br>30	And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that Jesus passed by, and they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.
<br>31	And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.
<br>32	And Jesus stood, and called them, and said: What will ye that I do to you?
<br>33	They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.
<br>34	And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw, and followed him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto mount Olivet, then Jesus sent two disciples,
<br>2	Saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to me.
<br>3	And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.
<br>4	Now all this was done that it might be ful- filled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
<br>5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.
<br>6	And the disciples going, did as Jesus com- manded them.
<br>7	And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.
<br>8	And a very great multitude spread their gar- ments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:
<br>9	And the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
<br>10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying: Who is this?
<br>11	And the people said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
<br>12	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves: 13 And he saith to them: It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but
<br>you have made it a den of thieves.
<br>14	And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple; and he healed them.
<br>15	And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to the son of David; were moved with indignation. 16 And said to him: Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of
<br>sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
<br>17	And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained there.
<br>18	And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.
<br> 
<br>19	And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only, and he saith to it: May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
<br>20	And the disciples seeing it wondered, say- ing: How is it presently withered away?
<br>21	And Jesus answering, said to them: Amen, I say to you, if you shall have faith, and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.
<br>22	And in all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.
<br>23	And when he was come into the temple, there came to him, as he was teaching, the chief priests and ancients of the people, saying: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority?
<br>24	Jesus answering, said to them: I also will ask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
<br>25	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying:
<br>26	If we shall say, from heaven, he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held John as a prophet.
<br>27	And answering Jesus, they said: We know not. He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
<br>28	But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
<br>29	And he answering, said: I will not. But af- terwards, being moved with repentance, he went. 30 And coming to the other, he said in like manner. And he answering, said: I go, Sir; and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>he went not.
<br>31	Which of the two did the father’s will? They say to him: The first. Jesus saith to them: Amen I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you.
<br>32	For John came to you in the way of justice, and you did not believe him. But the publicans and the harlots believed him: but you, seeing it, did not even afterwards repent, that you might believe him.
<br>33	Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to hus- bandmen; and went into a strange country.
<br>34	And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.
<br>35	And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
<br>36	Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.
<br>37	And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son.
<br>38	But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.
<br>39	And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
<br>40	When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husband- men?
<br>41	They say to him: He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in due season.
<br>42	Jesus saith to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures:  The stone which the builders
<br> 
<br>rejected, the same is become the head of the cor- ner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.
<br>43	Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.
<br>44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
<br>45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.
<br>46	And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes: because they held him as a prophet.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:
<br>2	The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son.
<br>3	And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.
<br>4	Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.
<br>5	But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his mer- chandise.
<br>6	And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.
<br>7	But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.
<br>8	Then he saith to his servants: The marriage
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.
<br>9	Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.
<br>10	And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.
<br>11	And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.
<br>12	And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.
<br>13	Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<br>14	For many are called, but few are chosen.
<br>15	Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.
<br>16	And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.
<br>17	Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
<br>18	But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?
<br>19	Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.
<br>20	And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?
<br>21	They say to him: Caesar’s. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God, the things that are God’s.
<br>22	And hearing this they wondered, and leav- ing him, went their ways.
<br> 
<br>23	That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him, 24 Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife,
<br>and raise up issue to his brother.
<br>25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.
<br>26	In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh.
<br>27	And last of all the woman died also.
<br>28	At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her.
<br>29	And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
<br>30	For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.
<br>31	And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:
<br>32	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
<br>33	And the multitudes hearing it, were in ad- miration at his doctrine.
<br>34	But the Pharisees hearing that he had si- lenced the Sadducees, came together:
<br>35	And one of them, a doctor of the law, ask- ing him, tempting him:
<br>36	Master, which is the greatest command- ment in the law?
<br>37	Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.
<br>38	This is the greatest and the first command- ment.
<br>39	And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>40	On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.
<br>41	And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,
<br>42	Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David’s.
<br>43	He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:
<br>44	The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
<br>45	If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
<br>46	And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
<br>2	Saying: The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses.
<br>3	All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe  and  do: but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not. 4 For they bind heavy and insupportable bur- dens, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but with
<br>a finger of their own they will not move them.
<br>5	And all their works they do for to be seen of men. For they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.
<br>6	And they love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the synagogues,
<br>7	And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.
<br>8	But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master; and all you are brethren.
<br>9	And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.
<br> 
<br>10	Neither be ye called masters; for one is you master, Christ.
<br>11	He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.
<br>12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled: and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
<br>13	But woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men, for you yourselves do not enter in; and those that are going in, you suffer not to enter.
<br>14	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites: because you devour the houses of wid- ows, praying long prayers. For this you shall receive the greater judgment.
<br>15	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; because you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves.
<br>16	Woe to you blind guides, that say, Whoso- ever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but he that shall swear by the gold of the temple, is a debtor.
<br>17	Ye foolish and blind; for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? 18 And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it
<br>is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, is a debtor.
<br>19	Ye blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
<br>20	He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things that are upon it:
<br>21	And whosoever shall swear by temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it:
<br>22	And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; because you tithe mint, and anise, and cummin, and have left the weightier things of the law; judgment, and mercy, and faith. These things you ought to have done, and not to leave those undone.
<br>24	Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.
<br>25	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; because you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within you are full of rapine and uncleanness.
<br>26	Thou blind Pharisee, first make clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside may become clean.
<br>27	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; because you are like to whited sepul- chres, which outwardly appear to men beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and of all filthiness.
<br>28	So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just; but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
<br>29	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyp- ocrites; that build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,
<br>30	And say: If we had been in the days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
<br>31	Wherefore you are witnesses against your- selves, that you are the sons of them that killed the prophets.
<br>32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
<br>33	You serpents, generation of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of hell?
<br>34	Therefore behold I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you will put to death and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
<br> 
<br>35	That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just, even unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.
<br>36	Amen I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
<br>37	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldest not?
<br>38	Behold, you house shall be left to you, des- olate.
<br>39	For I say to you, you shall not see me hence- forth till you say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And Jesus being come out of the temple, went away. And his disciples came to shew him the buildings of the temple.
<br>2	And he answering, said to them: Do you see all these things? Amen I say to you there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that shall not be destroyed.
<br>3	And when he was sitting on mount Olivet, the disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell us when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the world?
<br>4	And Jesus answering, said to them: Take heed that no man seduce you:
<br>5	For many will come in my name saying, I am Christ: and they will seduce many.
<br>6	And you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. See that ye be not troubled. For these things must come to pass, but the end is not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>yet.
<br>7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes in places:
<br>8	Now all these are the beginnings of sorrows.
<br>9	Then shall they deliver you up to be af- flicted, and shall put you to death: and you shall be hated by all nations for my name’s sake.
<br>10	And then shall many be scandalized: and shall betray one another: and shall hate one an- other.
<br>11	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall seduce many.
<br>12	And because iniquity hath abounded, the charity of many shall grow cold.
<br>13	But he that shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved.
<br>14	And this gospel of the kingdom, shall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all nations, and then shall the consummation come.
<br>15	When therefore you shall see the abomina- tion of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place: he that readeth let him understand.
<br>16	Then they that are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains:
<br>17	And he that is on the housetop, let him not come down to take any thing out of his house:
<br>18	And he that is in the field, let him not go back to take his coat.
<br>19	And woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in those days.
<br>20	But pray that your flight be not in the winter, or on the sabbath.
<br>21	For there shall be then great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall be.
<br> 
<br>22	And unless those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened.
<br>23	Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here is Christ, or there, do not believe him.
<br>24	For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and won- ders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect.
<br>25	Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.
<br>26	If therefore they shall say to you: Behold he is in the desert, go ye not out: Behold he is in the closets, believe it not.
<br>27	For as lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west: so shall the coming of the Son of man be.
<br>28	Wheresoever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered together.
<br>29	And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved:
<br>30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all tribes of the earth mourn: and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with much power and majesty.
<br>31	And he shall send his angels with a trum- pet, and a great voice: and they shall gather to- gether his elect from the four winds, from the far- thest parts of the heavens to the utmost bounds of them.
<br>32	And from the fig tree learn a parable: When the branch thereof is now tender, and the leaves come forth, you know that summer is nigh. 33 So you also, when you shall see all these things, know ye that it is nigh, even at the doors. 34 Amen I say to you, that this generation
<br>shall not pass, till all these things be done.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>35	Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass.
<br>36	But of that day and hour no one knoweth, not the angels of heaven, but the Father alone.
<br>37	And as in the days of Noe, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
<br>38	For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, even till that day in which Noe entered into the ark,
<br>39	And they knew not till the flood came, and took them all away; so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
<br>40	Then two shall be in the field: one shall be taken, and one shall be left.
<br>41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill: one shall be taken, and one shall be left.
<br>42	Watch ye therefore, because ye know not what hour your Lord will come.
<br>43	But know this ye, that if the goodman of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would certainly watch, and would not suffer his house to be broken open.
<br>44	Wherefore be you also ready, because at what hour you know not the Son of man will come.
<br>45	Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family, to give them meat in season.
<br>46	Blessed is that servant, whom when his lord shall come he shall find so doing.
<br>47	Amen I say to you, he shall place him over all his goods.
<br>48	But if that evil servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a coming:
<br>49	And shall begin to strike his fellow ser- vants, and shall eat and drink with drunkards:
<br>50	The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not, and at an hour that he knoweth not:
<br> 
<br>51	And shall separate him, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>
<br>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.
<br>2	And five of them were foolish, and five wise.
<br>3	But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them:
<br>4	But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.
<br>5	And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slum- bered and slept.
<br>6	And at midnight there was a cry made: Be- hold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.
<br>7	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
<br>8	And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.
<br>9	The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 10 Now whilst they went to buy, the bride- groom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. 11 But at last come also the other virgins,
<br>saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.
<br>12	But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.
<br>13	Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.
<br>14	For even as a man going into a far coun- try, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods;
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.
<br>16	And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five.
<br>17	And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.
<br>18	But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
<br>19	But after a long time the lord of those ser- vants came, and reckoned with them.
<br>20	And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above.
<br>21	His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<br>22	And he also that had received the two tal- ents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two.
<br>23	His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<br>24	But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.
<br>25	And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.
<br>26	And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:
<br> 
<br>27	Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.
<br>28	Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.
<br>29	For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.
<br>30	And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weep- ing and gnashing of teeth.
<br>31	And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.
<br>32	And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:
<br>33	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
<br>34	Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
<br>35	For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:
<br>36	Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.
<br>37	Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?
<br>38	And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?
<br>39	Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?
<br>40	And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>41	Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.
<br>42	For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.
<br>43	I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
<br>44	Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
<br>45	Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.
<br>46	And these shall go into everlasting punish- ment: but the just, into life everlasting.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:
<br>2	You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified:
<br>3	Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:
<br>4	And they consulted together, that by sub- tilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death.
<br>5	But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the peo- ple.
<br>6	And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,
<br>7	There came to him a woman having an al- abaster box of precious ointment, and poured it
<br> 
<br>on his head as he was at table.
<br>8	And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?
<br>9	For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
<br>10	And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
<br>11	For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.
<br>12	For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.
<br>13	Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.
<br>14	Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
<br>15	And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they ap- pointed him thirty pieces of silver.
<br>16	And from thenceforth he sought opportu- nity to betray him.
<br>17	And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?
<br>18	But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.
<br>19	And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.
<br>20	But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.
<br>21	And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.
<br>22	And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.
<br>24	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is writ- ten of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.
<br>25	And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.
<br>26	And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.
<br>27	And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.
<br>28	For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.
<br>29	And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.
<br>30	And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.
<br>31	Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed:
<br>32	But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
<br>33	And Peter answering, said to him: Al- though all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.
<br>34	Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.
<br>35	Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.
<br> 
<br>36	Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.
<br>37	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.
<br>38	Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.
<br>39	And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Never- theless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
<br>40	And he cometh to his disciples, and find- eth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?
<br>41	Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.
<br>42	Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.
<br>43	And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.
<br>44	And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word. 45 Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be
<br>betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<br>46	Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.
<br>47	As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.
<br>48	And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>49	And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.
<br>50	And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.
<br>51	And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.
<br>52	Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
<br>53	Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?
<br>54	How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?
<br>55	In that same hour Jesus said to the multi- tudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.
<br>56	Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the dis- ciples all leaving him, fled.
<br>57	But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the an- cients were assembled.
<br>58	And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end. 59 And the chief priests and the whole coun- cil sought false witness against Jesus, that they
<br>might put him to death:
<br>60	And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:
<br>61	And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.
<br> 
<br>62	And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?
<br>63	But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.
<br>64	Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nev- ertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
<br>65	Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:
<br>66	What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.
<br>67	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,
<br>68	Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?
<br>69	But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.
<br>70	But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.
<br>71	And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. 72 And again he denied with an oath, I know
<br>not the man.
<br>73	And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.
<br>74	Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
<br>2	And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
<br>3	Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,
<br>4	Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.
<br>5	And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged him- self with an halter.
<br>6	But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.
<br>7	And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter’s field, to be a bury- ing place for strangers.
<br>8	For this cause the field was called Hacel- dama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.
<br>9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.
<br>10	And they gave them unto the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed to me.
<br>11	And Jesus stood before the governor, and
<br> 
<br>the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.
<br>12	And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.
<br>13	Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?
<br>14	And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.
<br>15	Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.
<br>16	And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.
<br>17	They therefore being gathered together, Pi- late said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?
<br>18	For he knew that for envy they had deliv- ered him.
<br>19	And as he was sitting in the place of judg- ment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suf- fered many things this day in a dream because of him.
<br>20	But the chief priests and ancients per- suaded the people, that they should ask Barab- bas, and make Jesus away.
<br>21	And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.
<br>22	Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.
<br>23	The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.
<br>24	And Pilate seeing that he prevailed noth- ing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, say-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ing: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.
<br>25	And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.
<br>26	Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.
<br>27	Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;
<br>28	And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.
<br>29	And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.
<br>30	And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.
<br>31	And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.
<br>32	And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.
<br>33	And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.
<br>34	And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall.   And when he had tasted, he would not drink.
<br>35	And after they had crucified him, they di- vided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, say- ing: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
<br>36	And they sat and watched him.
<br>37	And they put over his head his cause writ- ten: THIS IS JESUS THE  KING  OF  THE JEWS.
<br>38	Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.
<br> 
<br>39	And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
<br>40	And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God,  and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
<br>41	In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:
<br>42	He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
<br>43	He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.
<br>44	And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.
<br>45	Now from the sixth hour there was dark- ness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with
<br>a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou for- saken me?
<br>47	And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.
<br>48	And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
<br>49	And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.
<br>50	And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
<br>51	And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.
<br>52	And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,
<br>53	And coming out of the tombs after his res- urrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>54	Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.
<br>55	And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
<br>56	Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<br>57	And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.
<br>58	He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.
<br>59	And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.
<br>60	And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.
<br>61	And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepul- chre.
<br>62	And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
<br>63	Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.
<br>64	Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his dis- ciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.
<br>65	Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.
<br>66	And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 28
<br>And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.
<br>2	And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.
<br>3	And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.
<br>4	And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.
<br>5	And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
<br>6	He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid. 7 And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen: and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have
<br>foretold it to you.
<br>8	And they went out quickly from the sepul- chre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.
<br>9	And behold Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.
<br>10	Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.
<br>11	Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.
<br>12	And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,
<br>13	Saying: Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep.
<br> 
<br>
<br>14	And if the governor shall hear this, we will persuade him, and secure you.
<br>15	So they taking the money, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.
<br>16	And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
<br>17	And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.
<br>18	And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth. 19 Going therefore, teach ye all nations; bap- tizing them in the name of the Father, and of
<br>the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
<br>20 Teaching them to observe all things what- soever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.

<br>
<br>The Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ, According to St. Mark
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
<br>2	As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Be- hold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.
<br>3	A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.
<br>4	John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remis- sion of sins.
<br>5	And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
<br>6	And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate lo- custs and wild honey.
<br>7	And he preached, saying: There cometh af- ter me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. 8 I have baptized you with water; but he shall
<br>baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
<br>9	And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
<br>10	And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a
<br> 
<br>dove descending, and remaining on him.
<br>11	And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
<br>12	And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.
<br>13	And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
<br>14	And after that John was delivered up, Je- sus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
<br>15	And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and be- lieve the gospel.
<br>16	And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).
<br>17	And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
<br>18	And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.
<br>19	And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:
<br>20	And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.
<br>22	And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.
<br>23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
<br>24	Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.
<br>25	And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.
<br>26	And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.
<br>27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
<br>28	And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.
<br>29	And immediately going out of the syna- gogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
<br>30	And Simon’s wife’s mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.
<br>31	And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
<br>32	And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.
<br>33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
<br>34	And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.
<br> 
<br>35	And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.
<br>36	And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.
<br>37	And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.
<br>38	And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.
<br>39	And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.
<br>40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
<br>41	And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.
<br>42	And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
<br>43	And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.
<br>44	And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and of- fer for thy cleansing the things that Moses com- manded, for a testimony to them.
<br>45	But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days.
<br>2 And it was heard that he was in the house, and many came together, so that there was no room; no, not even at the door; and he spoke to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>them the word.
<br>3	And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.
<br>4	And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was; and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.
<br>5	And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
<br>6	And there were some of the scribes sitting there, and thinking in their hearts:
<br>7	Why doth this man speak thus? he blas- phemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God only?
<br>8	Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit, that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts?
<br>9	Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?
<br>10	But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
<br>11	I say to thee: Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
<br>12	And immediately he arose; and taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all; so that all wondered and glorified God, saying: We never saw the like.
<br>13	And he went forth again to the sea side; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
<br>14	And when he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the receipt of cus- tom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him.
<br>15	And it came to pass, that as he sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners
<br> 
<br>sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they were many, who also followed him.
<br>16	And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disiples: Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
<br>17	Jesus hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the just, but sinners.
<br>18	And the disiples of John and the Pharisees used to fast; and they come and say to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast?
<br>19	And Jesus saith to them: Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
<br>20	But the days will come when the bride- groom shall be taken away from them; and then they shall fast in those days.
<br>21	No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.
<br>22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bot- tles, and both the wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles.
<br>23	And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward, and to pluck the ears of corn.
<br>24	And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
<br>25	And he said to them: Have you never read what David did when he had need, and was hun- gry himself, and they that were with him?
