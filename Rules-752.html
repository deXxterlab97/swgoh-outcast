<br>(2) The aggregate amount of guarantees outstanding under this section at any one time shall not exceed $60,000,000.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) There is established in the Treasury of the United States an Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Development Fund (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the "fund"), which shall be available to the Secretary of Energy for carrying out the loan guarantee and principal and interest assistance program authorized by this chapter, including the payment of administrative expenses incurred in connection therewith. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be invested in bonds or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) There shall be paid into the fund such part of the amounts appropriated pursuant to section 2514 of this title as the Secretary of Energy deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and such amounts as may be returned to the United States pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, and the amounts in the fund shall remain available until expended, except that after the expiration of the 7-year period established by subsection (h) of this section such amounts in the fund as are not required to secure outstanding guarantee obligations shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(C) If at any time the moneys available in the fund are insufficient to enable the Secretary of Energy to discharge his responsibilities under this section, he shall issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This borrowing authority shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are specified in appropriation Acts. Such authority shall be without fiscal year limitation. Redemption of such notes or obligations shall be made by the Secretary of Energy from appropriations or other moneys available under this chapter. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall not be less than a rate determined by taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes or obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.
<br>
<br>(D) Business-type financial reports covering the operations of the fund shall be submitted to the Congress by the Secretary of Energy annually upon the completion of the appropriate accounting period.
<br>(f) Qualified borrower
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term "qualified borrower" means any partnership, corporation, or other legal entity which (as determined by the Secretary of Energy) has presented satisfactory evidence of an interest in electric or hybrid vehicle technology and is capable of performing research or completing the development and production of electric or hybrid vehicles or any components thereof in an acceptable manner.
<br>(g) Payment of principal and interest; default; recovery of losses
<br>
<br>(1) With respect to any loan guaranteed pursuant to this section, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to enter into a contract to pay, and to pay, the lender for and on behalf of the borrower the principal and interest charges which become due and payable on the unpaid balance of such loan if the Secretary of Energy finds—
<br>
<br>(A) that the borrower is unable to meet principal and interest charges, that it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of the project, and that the probable net cost to the Federal Government in paying such principal will be less than that which would result in the event of a default; and
<br>
<br>(B) that the amount of such principal and interest charges which the Secretary of Energy is authorized to pay shall be no greater than the amount of principal and interest which the borrower is obligated to pay under the loan agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) In the event of any default by a qualified borrower on a guaranteed loan, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to make payment in accordance with the guarantee, and the Attorney General shall take such action as may be appropriate to recover the amounts of such payments (including any payment of principal and interest under paragraph (1)) from such assets of the defaulting borrower as are associated with the activity with respect to which the loan was made or from any other surety included in the terms of the guarantee.
<br>(h) Seven year limitation
<br>
<br>No loan guarantee shall be made, or interest assistance contracts entered into, pursuant to this section, after the expiration of the 7-year period following September 17, 1976.
<br>(i) Citizenship of applicant; corporations; waiver
<br>
<br>An applicant seeking a guarantee under this section must be a citizen or national of the United States. A corporation, partnership, firm, or association shall not be deemed to be a citizen or national of the United States unless the Secretary of Energy determines that it satisfactorily meets all the requirements of section 50501 of title 46, for determining such citizenship, except that the provisions in subsections (a) and (b) of such section 50501 concerning (1) the citizenship of officers or directors of a corporation, and (2) the interest required to be owned in the case of a corporation, association, or partnership operating a vessel in the coastwise trade, shall not be applicable. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may waive such requirements in the case of a corporation, partnership, firm, or association, controlling interest in which is owned by citizens of countries which are participants in the International Energy Agreement.
<br>(j) Pledge of full faith and credit of United States
<br>
<br>The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all obligations incurred under this section.

<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) human beings and the environment are being exposed each year to a large number of chemical substances and mixtures;
<br>
<br>(2) among the many chemical substances and mixtures which are constantly being developed and produced, there are some whose manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment; and
<br>
<br>(3) the effective regulation of interstate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures also necessitates the regulation of intrastate commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures.
<br>(b) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>(1) adequate information should be developed with respect to the effect of chemical substances and mixtures on health and the environment and that the development of such information should be the responsibility of those who manufacture and those who process such chemical substances and mixtures;
<br>
<br>(2) adequate authority should exist to regulate chemical substances and mixtures which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and to take action with respect to chemical substances and mixtures which are imminent hazards; and
<br>
<br>(3) authority over chemical substances and mixtures should be exercised in such a manner as not to impede unduly or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation while fulfilling the primary purpose of this chapter to assure that such innovation and commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures do not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
<br>(c) Intent of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the intent of Congress that the Administrator shall carry out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner, and that the Administrator shall consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action the Administrator takes or proposes as provided under this chapter.

<br>§2603. Testing of chemical substances and mixtures
<br>(a) Testing requirements
<br>
<br>(1) If the Administrator finds that—
<br>
<br>(A)(i)(I) the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,
<br>
<br>(II) there is insufficient information and experience upon which the effects of such manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and
<br>
<br>(III) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such information; or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) a chemical substance or mixture is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and (aa) it enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or (bb) there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to such substance or mixture,
<br>
<br>(II) there is insufficient information and experience upon which the effects of the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture or of any combination of such activities on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and
<br>
<br>(III) testing of such substance or mixture with respect to such effects is necessary to develop such information; and
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a mixture, the effects which the mixture's manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal or any combination of such activities may have on health or the environment may not be reasonably and more efficiently determined or predicted by testing the chemical substances which comprise the mixture;
<br>
<br>the Administrator shall by rule, or, in the case of a chemical substance or mixture described in subparagraph (A)(i), by rule, order, or consent agreement, require that testing be conducted on such substance or mixture to develop information with respect to the health and environmental effects for which there is an insufficiency of information and experience and which is relevant to a determination that the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
<br>
<br>(2) Additional testing authority.—In addition to the authority provided under paragraph (1), the Administrator may, by rule, order, or consent agreement—
<br>
<br>(A) require the development of new information relating to a chemical substance or mixture if the Administrator determines that the information is necessary—
<br>
<br>(i) to review a notice under section 2604 of this title or to perform a risk evaluation under section 2605(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) to implement a requirement imposed in a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (e) or (f) of section 2604 of this title or in a rule promulgated under section 2605(a) of this title;
<br>
<br>(iii) at the request of a Federal implementing authority under another Federal law, to meet the regulatory testing needs of that authority with regard to toxicity and exposure; or
<br>
<br>(iv) pursuant to section 2611(a)(2) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) require the development of new information for the purposes of prioritizing a chemical substance under section 2605(b) of this title only if the Administrator determines that such information is necessary to establish the priority of the substance, subject to the limitations that—
<br>
<br>(i) not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of information regarding a chemical substance complying with a rule, order, or consent agreement under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall designate the chemical substance as a high-priority substance or a low-priority substance; and
<br>
<br>(ii) information required by the Administrator under this subparagraph shall not be required for the purposes of establishing or implementing a minimum information requirement of broader applicability.
<br>
<br>(3) Statement of need.—When requiring the development of new information relating to a chemical substance or mixture under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall identify the need for the new information, describe how information reasonably available to the Administrator was used to inform the decision to require new information, explain the basis for any decision that requires the use of vertebrate animals, and, as applicable, explain why issuance of an order is warranted instead of promulgating a rule or entering into a consent agreement.
<br>
<br>(4) Tiered testing.—When requiring the development of new information under this subsection, the Administrator shall employ a tiered screening and testing process, under which the results of screening-level tests or assessments of available information inform the decision as to whether 1 or more additional tests are necessary, unless information available to the Administrator justifies more advanced testing of potential health or environmental effects or potential exposure without first conducting screening-level testing.
<br>(b) Testing requirement rule, order, or consent agreement
<br>
<br>(1) A rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) identification of the chemical substance or mixture for which testing is required under the rule, order, or consent agreement,
<br>
<br>(B) protocols and methodologies for the development of information for such substance or mixture, and
<br>
<br>(C) with respect to chemical substances which are not new chemical substances and to mixtures, a specification of the period (which period may not be of unreasonable duration) within which the persons required to conduct the testing shall submit to the Administrator information developed in accordance with the protocols and methodologies referred to in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>In determining the protocols and methodologies and period to be included, pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), the Administrator's considerations shall include the relative costs of the various test protocols and methodologies which may be required under the rule, order, or consent agreement and the reasonably foreseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testing required under the rule, order, or consent agreement. Any such rule, order, or consent agreement may require the submission to the Administrator of preliminary information during the period prescribed under subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The health and environmental effects for which protocols and methodologies for the development of information may be prescribed include carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, teratogenesis, behavioral disorders, cumulative or synergistic effects, and any other effect which may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Protocols and methodologies for the development of information may also be prescribed for the assessment of exposure or exposure potential to humans or the environment. The characteristics of chemical substances and mixtures for which such protocols and methodologies may be prescribed include persistence, acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and any other characteristic which may present such a risk. The methodologies that may be prescribed in such protocols and methodologies include epidemiologic studies, serial or tiered testing, in vitro tests, and whole animal tests, except that before prescribing epidemiologic studies of employees, the Administrator shall consult with the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
<br>
<br>(B) From time to time, but not less than once each 12 months, the Administrator shall review the adequacy of the protocols and methodologies for development of information prescribed in rules, orders, and consent agreements under subsection (a) and shall, if necessary, institute proceedings to make appropriate revisions of such protocols and methodologies.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) A rule or order under subsection (a) respecting a chemical substance or mixture shall require the persons described in subparagraph (B) or (C), as applicable, to conduct tests and submit information to the Administrator on such substance or mixture, except that the Administrator may permit two or more of such persons to designate one such person or a qualified third party to conduct such tests and submit such information on behalf of the persons making the designation.
<br>
<br>(B) The following persons shall be required to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture subject to a rule under subsection (a)(1):
<br>
<br>(i) Each person who manufactures or intends to manufacture such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the manufacture of such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(ii) Each person who processes or intends to process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the processing of such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(iii) Each person who manufactures or processes or intends to manufacture or process such substance or mixture if the Administrator makes a finding described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i)(II) or (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) with respect to the distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(C) A rule or order under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) may require the development of information by any person who manufactures or processes, or intends to manufacture or process, a chemical substance or mixture subject to the rule or order.
<br>
<br>(4) Any rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) requiring the testing of and submission of information for a particular chemical substance or mixture shall expire at the end of the reimbursement period (as defined in subsection (c)(3)(B)) which is applicable to information for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator repeals the rule or order or modifies the consent agreement to terminate the requirement before such date; and a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) requiring the testing of and submission of information for a category of chemical substances or mixtures shall expire with respect to a chemical substance or mixture included in the category at the end of the reimbursement period (as so defined) which is applicable to information for such substance or mixture unless the Administrator before such date repeals or modifies the application of the rule, order, or consent agreement to such substance or mixture or repeals the rule or order or modifies the consent agreement to terminate the requirement.
<br>(c) Exemption
<br>
<br>(1) Any person required by a rule or order under subsection (a) to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture may apply to the Administrator (in such form and manner as the Administrator shall prescribe) for an exemption from such requirement.
<br>
<br>(2) If, upon receipt of an application under paragraph (1), the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the chemical substance or mixture with respect to which such application was submitted is equivalent to a chemical substance or mixture for which information has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) or for which information is being developed pursuant to such a rule, order, or consent agreement, and
<br>
<br>(B) submission of information by the applicant on such substance or mixture would be duplicative of information which has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with such rule, order, or consent agreement or which is being developed pursuant to such rule, order, or consent agreement,
<br>
<br>the Administrator shall exempt, in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4), the applicant from conducting tests and submitting information on such substance or mixture under the rule or order with respect to which such application was submitted.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the existence of previously submitted information and if such exemption is granted during the reimbursement period for such information (as prescribed by subparagraph (B)), then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—
<br>
<br>(i) to the person who previously submitted such information, for a portion of the costs incurred by such person in complying with the requirement to submit such information, and
<br>
<br>(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to such costs, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.
<br>
<br>In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider all relevant factors, including the effect on the competitive position of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the person to be reimbursed and the share of the market for such substance or mixture of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the share of such market of the persons to be reimbursed. An order under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reimbursement period for any information for a chemical substance or mixture is a period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on the date such information is submitted in accordance with a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending—
<br>
<br>(I) five years after the date referred to in clause (i), or
<br>
<br>(II) at the expiration of a period which begins on the date referred to in clause (i) and which is equal to the period which the Administrator determines was necessary to develop such information,
<br>
<br>whichever is later.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If the exemption under paragraph (2) of any person from the requirement to conduct tests and submit information on a chemical substance or mixture is granted on the basis of the fact that information is being developed by one or more persons pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—
<br>
<br>(i) to each such person who is developing such information, for a portion of the costs incurred by each such person in complying with such rule, order, or consent agreement, and
<br>
<br>(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to the costs of complying with such rule, order, or consent agreement, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.
<br>
<br>In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider the factors described in the second sentence of paragraph (3)(A). An order under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(B) If any exemption is granted under paragraph (2) on the basis of the fact that one or more persons are developing information pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a) and if after such exemption is granted the Administrator determines that no such person has complied with such rule, order, or consent agreement, the Administrator shall (i) after providing written notice to the person who holds such exemption and an opportunity for a hearing, by order terminate such exemption, and (ii) notify in writing such person of the requirements of the rule or order with respect to which such exemption was granted.
<br>(d) Notice
<br>
<br>Upon the receipt of any information pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under subsection (a), the Administrator shall publish a notice of the receipt of such information in the Federal Register within 15 days of its receipt. Subject to section 2613 of this title, each such notice shall (1) identify the chemical substance or mixture for which information has been received; (2) list the uses or intended uses of such substance or mixture and the information required by the applicable protocols and methodologies for the development of information; and (3) describe the nature of the information developed. Except as otherwise provided in section 2613 of this title, such information shall be made available by the Administrator for examination by any person.
<br>(e) Priority list
<br>
<br>(1)(A) There is established a committee to make recommendations to the Administrator respecting the chemical substances and mixtures to which the Administrator should give priority consideration for the development of information under subsection (a). In making such a recommendation with respect to any chemical substance or mixture, the committee shall consider all relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(i) the quantities in which the substance or mixture is or will be manufactured,
<br>
<br>(ii) the quantities in which the substance or mixture enters or will enter the environment,
<br>
<br>(iii) the number of individuals who are or will be exposed to the substance or mixture in their places of employment and the duration of such exposure,
<br>
<br>(iv) the extent to which human beings are or will be exposed to the substance or mixture,
<br>
<br>(v) the extent to which the substance or mixture is closely related to a chemical substance or mixture which is known to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,
<br>
<br>(vi) the existence of information concerning the effects of the substance or mixture on health or the environment,
<br>
<br>(vii) the extent to which testing of the substance or mixture may result in the development of information upon which the effects of the substance or mixture on health or the environment can reasonably be determined or predicted, and

<br>
<br>(viii) industry consortia that develop information submitted under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(B) as practicable, ensure that the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A) is reflected in the development of requirements for testing under this section;
<br>
<br>(C) include in the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A) a list, which the Administrator shall update on a regular basis, of particular alternative test methods or strategies the Administrator has identified that do not require new vertebrate animal testing and are scientifically reliable, relevant, and capable of providing information of equivalent or better scientific reliability and quality to that which would be obtained from vertebrate animal testing;
<br>
<br>(D) provide an opportunity for public notice and comment on the contents of the plan developed under subparagraph (A), including the criteria for considering scientific reliability and relevance of the test methods and strategies that may be identified pursuant to subparagraph (C);
<br>
<br>(E) beginning on the date that is 5 years after June 22, 2016, and every 5 years thereafter, submit to Congress a report that describes the progress made in implementing the plan developed under subparagraph (A) and goals for future alternative test methods and strategies implementation; and
<br>
<br>(F) prioritize and, to the extent consistent with available resources and the Administrator's other responsibilities under this subchapter, carry out performance assessment, validation, and translational studies to accelerate the development of scientifically valid test methods and strategies that reduce, refine, or replace the use of vertebrate animals, including minimizing duplication, in any testing under this subchapter.
<br>(3) Voluntary testing
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any person developing information for submission under this subchapter on a voluntary basis and not pursuant to any request or requirement by the Administrator shall first attempt to develop the information by means of an alternative test method or strategy identified by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), if the Administrator has identified such a test method or strategy for the development of such information, before conducting new vertebrate animal testing.
<br>(B) Effect of paragraph
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall, under any circumstance, limit or restrict the submission of any existing information to the Administrator.
<br>(C) Relationship to other law
<br>
