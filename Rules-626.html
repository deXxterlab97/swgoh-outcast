L. 100–418), Pub. L. 100–418 does not contain a section 3816, and section 5406 of Pub. L. 100–418 is the provision establishing the Data Bank.

<br>(b) Distinctive marking or device; exception; waiver; adjustments and changes
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), each toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm shall have as an integral part, permanently affixed, a blaze orange plug inserted in the barrel of such toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm. Such plug shall be recessed no more than 6 millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel of such firearm.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of Commerce may provide for an alternate marking or device for any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm not capable of being marked as provided in paragraph (1) and may waive the requirement of any such marking or device for any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm that will only be used in the theatrical, movie or television industry.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary is authorized to make adjustments and changes in the marking system provided for by this section, after consulting with interested persons.
<br>(c) "Look-alike firearm" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "look-alike firearm" means any imitation of any original firearm which was manufactured, designed, and produced since 1898, including and limited to toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns, and air-soft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles. Such term does not include any look-alike, nonfiring, collector replica of an antique firearm developed prior to 1898, or traditional B–B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure.
<br>(d) Study and report
<br>
<br>The Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics is authorized and directed to conduct a study of the criminal misuse of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms, including studying police reports of such incidences and shall report on such incidences relative to marked and unmarked firearms.
<br>(c) 1 Technical evaluation of marking systems
<br>
<br>The Director of 2 National Institute of Justice is authorized and directed to conduct a technical evaluation of the marking systems provided for in subsection (b) to determine their effectiveness in police combat situations. The Director shall begin the study within 3 months after November 5, 1988, and such study shall be completed within 9 months after November 5, 1988.
<br>(f) Effective date

<br>(g) Preemption of State or local laws or ordinances; exceptions
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall supersede any provision of State or local laws or ordinances which provide for markings or identification inconsistent with provisions of this section provided that no State shall—
<br>
<br>(i) prohibit the sale or manufacture of any look-alike, nonfiring, collector replica of an antique firearm developed prior to 1898, or
<br>
<br>(ii) prohibit the sale (other than prohibiting the sale to minors) of traditional B–B, paint ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure.

<br>§5201. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) recent discoveries of high-temperature superconducting materials could result in significant new applications of these materials in such areas as microelectronics, computers, power systems, transportation, medical imaging, and nuclear fusion, yet most potential applications may well lie beyond our ability to predict them;
<br>
<br>(2) full application of the new superconductors is expected to require 10 to 20 years, thus calling for long-term commitments by the public and private sector to appropriate research and development programs;
<br>
<br>(3) the Nation's economic competitiveness and strategic well-being depend greatly on the development and application of critical advanced technologies such as those anticipated to evolve from the new superconducting materials;
<br>
<br>(4) the United States manufacturing industries confront strong competition in both domestic and world markets as other countries are increasingly taking advantage of modern technology and production techniques and innovative management focused on quality;
<br>
<br>(5) whereas we have as a Nation been highly successful in the conduct of basic research in a variety of scientific areas, including superconductivity, other nations have been highly successful in the commercial and military application of the results of such fundamental research;
<br>
<br>(6) if the United States is to begin its competitive advantage, it must commit sufficient long-term resources to solving processing and manufacturing problems in parallel with basic research and development;
<br>
<br>(7) Federal agencies have responded aggressively to this exciting challenge by reprogramming funds to basic superconductivity research while informally coordinating their efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication; and further commitment of Federal funding and efforts directed to developing manufacturing, materials processing, and fabrication technologies is essential so that these activities may be conducted in parallel;
<br>
<br>(8) successful development and application of the new superconducting materials will require close collaboration between the Federal Government and the industrial and academic components of the private sector, as well as coordinating among the Federal departments and agencies involved in research and development on superconductors;
<br>
<br>(9) a committed Federal program effort with appropriate long-term goals, priorities, and adequate resources is necessary for the rapid development and application of the new superconducting materials; and
<br>
<br>(10) a national program should serve as a test of new agency authorities directed at technological competitiveness such as those provided to the Department of Energy.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to establish a 5-year national action plan to research and develop new high-temperature superconducting materials with appropriate goals and priorities; 1
<br>
<br>(2) to designate the appropriate roles, mechanisms, and responsibilities of various Federal departments and agencies in implementing such a national research and development action plan.

<br>§5202. National Action Plan on Advanced Superconductivity Research and Development
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>(1) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall establish a 5-year National Action Plan on Advanced Superconductivity Research and Development (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the "Superconductivity Action Plan").
<br>
<br>(2) The Office of Science and Technology Policy shall coordinate the development of the Superconductivity Action Plan and any recommendations required by this chapter with the National Critical Materials Council and the National Commission on Superconductivity.
<br>(b) Content and scope
<br>

<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) metal casting is an important process for manufacturing many items imported into or exported from the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) the encouragement and maintenance of a technically advanced United States metal casting industry is essential to the competitiveness of many American industries;
<br>
<br>(3) maintaining a viable metal casting industry is vital to the national security and economic well being of the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) the promotion of technology competitiveness and energy efficiency in the United States metal casting industry by the Federal Government is necessary to maintain a viable metal casting industry;
<br>
<br>(5) many metal casting companies lack the resources to conduct metal casting research alone, placing them at a serious competitive disadvantage;
<br>
<br>(6) the support of university-based research in metal casting is important in promoting technology development and providing industry with qualified engineers; and
<br>
<br>(7) by combining the resources of the Federal Government, universities, industry, and private organizations, to conduct research and development activities, substantial technological benefits will result to the metal casting industry.
