<br>§3363. Emergency allocation authority
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>In order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas during any natural gas supply emergency declared under section 3361 of this title, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas under subsections (b), (c), and (d) to—
<br>
<br>(1) any interstate pipeline;
<br>
<br>(2) any local distribution company—
<br>
<br>(A) which is served by any interstate pipeline;
<br>
<br>(B) which is providing natural gas only for high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(C) which is in need of deliveries of natural gas to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas; and
<br>
<br>(3) any person for meeting requirements of high-priority uses of natural gas.
<br>(b) Allocation of certain boiler fuel gas
<br>(1) Required finding
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, emergency purchase authority under section 3362 of this title has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) emergency purchases of natural gas supplies under section 3362 of this title are not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to to 1 the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries.
<br>(2) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (1), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas the use of which has been prohibited by the President pursuant to authority under section 717z of this title (relating to the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel during any natural gas supply emergency).
<br>(c) Allocation of general pipeline supply
<br>(1) Required findings
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (b) has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries;
<br>
<br>(E) such allocation will not create, for the interstate pipeline delivering certificated natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such pipeline to be unable to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas served, directly or indirectly, by such pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(F) such allocation will not result in a disproportionate share of deliveries and resulting curtailments of natural gas being experienced by such interstate pipeline when compared to deliveries and resulting curtailments which are experienced as a result of orders issued under this subsection applicable to other interstate pipelines (as determined by the President).
<br>(2) Required notification from State
<br>(A) 2 Notification
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he is notified by the Governor of any State that—
<br>
<br>(i) a shortage of natural gas supplies available to such State exists or is imminent;
<br>
<br>(ii) such shortage or imminent shortage endangers the supply of natural gas for high-priority uses in such State; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the exercise of authority under State law is inadequate to protect high-priority uses of natural gas in such State from an interruption in natural gas supplies.
<br>(3) Basis of finding
<br>
<br>To the maximum extent practicable, the Governor shall submit, together with any notification under subparagraph (A), information upon which he has based his finding under such subparagraph, including—
<br>
<br>(i) volumes of natural gas required to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas in such State;
<br>
<br>(ii) information received from persons in the business of producing, selling, transporting, or delivering natural gas in such State as to the volumes of natural gas supplies available to such State;
<br>
<br>(iii) information on the authority under State law which will be exercised to protect high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(iv) such other information which the President requests or which the Governor determines appropriate to apprise the President of emergency deliveries and transportation of interstate natural gas needed by such State.
<br>(4) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (1), (2), and (5), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of certificated natural gas from any interstate pipeline.
<br>(5) Consideration of alternative fuel availability
<br>
<br>In issuing any order under this subsection the President shall consider the relative availability of alternative fuel to natural gas users supplied by the interstate pipeline ordered to make deliveries pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(d) Allocation of user-owned gas
<br>(1) Required finding
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (c) has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries; and
<br>
<br>(E) such allocation will not create, for the person who owns and would otherwise use such natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such person to be unable to satisfy such person's natural gas requirements for high-priority uses.
<br>(2) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas which would be certificated natural gas but for the second sentence of section 3301(19) of this title.
<br>(3) Consideration of economic feasibility of alternative fuels
<br>
<br>In issuing any order under this subsection, the President shall consider the economic feasibility of alternative fuels available to the user which owned the natural gas subject to an order under this subsection.
<br>(e) Limitation
<br>
<br>No order may be issued under this section unless the President determines that such order will not require transportation of natural gas by any pipeline in excess of its available transportation capacity.
<br>(f) Industry assistance
<br>
<br>The President may request that representatives of pipelines, local distribution companies, and other persons meet and provide assistance to the President in carrying out his authority under this section.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the parties to any order issued under subsection (b), (c), (d), or (h) fail to agree upon the terms of compensation for natural gas deliveries or transportation required pursuant to such order, the President, after a hearing held either before or after such order takes effect, shall, by supplemental order, prescribe the amount of compensation to be paid for such deliveries or transportation and for any other expenses incurred in delivering or transporting natural gas.
<br>(2) Calculation of compensation for certain boiler fuel natural gas
<br>
<br>For purposes of any supplemental order under paragraph (1) with respect to emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (b), the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
<br>
<br>(A) for supplies of natural gas based upon the amount required to make whole the user subject to the prohibition order, but in no event may such compensation exceed just compensation prescribed in section 717z of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President.
<br>(3) Compensation for other natural gas allocated
<br>
<br>For the purpose of any supplemental order under paragraph (1), if the party making emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (c) or (d)—
<br>
<br>(A) indicates a preference for compensation in kind, the President shall direct that compensation in kind be provided as expeditiously as practicable;
<br>
<br>(B) indicates a preference for compensation, or the President determines that, notwithstanding paragraph (A) of this subsection, any portion thereof cannot practicably be compensated in kind, the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
<br>
<br>(i) for supplies of natural gas, based upon the amount required to make the pipeline and its local distribution companies whole, in the case of any order under subsection (c), or to make the user from whom natural gas is allocated whole, in the case of any order under subsection (d) including any amount actually paid by such pipeline and its local distribution companies or such user for volumes of natural gas or higher cost synthetic gas acquired to replace natural gas subject to an order under subsection (c) or (d); and
<br>
<br>(ii) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President. Compensation received by an interstate pipeline under this subsection shall be credited to the account of any local distribution company served by that pipeline to the extent ordered by the President to make such local distribution company whole.
<br>(h) Related transportation and facilities
<br>
<br>The President may, by order, require any pipeline to transport natural gas, and to construct and operate such facilities for the transportation of natural gas, as he determines necessary to carry out any order under subsection (b), (c), or (d). Compensation for the costs of any construction or transportation ordered under this subsection shall be determined under subsection (g) and shall be paid by the person to whom supplies of natural gas are ordered allocated under this section.
<br>(i) Monitoring
<br>
<br>In order to effect the purposes of this part, the President shall monitor the operation of any order made pursuant to this section to assure that natural gas delivered pursuant to this section is applied to high-priority uses only.
<br>(j) Commission study
<br>
<br>Not later than June 1, 1979, the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report regarding whether authority to allocate natural gas, which is not otherwise subject to allocation under this part, is likely to be necessary to meet high-priority uses.
<br>(k) "High-priority use" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "high-priority use" means any—
<br>
<br>(1) use of natural gas in a residence;
<br>
<br>(2) use of natural gas in a commercial establishment in amounts less than 50 Mcf on a peak day; or
<br>
<br>(3) any use of natural gas the curtailment of which the President determines would endanger life, health, or maintenance of physical property.

<br>(i) any intrastate pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any local distribution company.
<br>(B) Just and reasonable rates
<br>
<br>The rates and charges of any interstate pipeline with respect to any transportation authorized under subparagraph (A) shall be just and reasonable (within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.]).
<br>(2) Intrastate pipelines
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may, by rule or order, authorize any intrastate pipeline to transport natural gas on behalf of—
<br>

<br>(i) Maximum fair and equitable price
<br>
<br>The rates and charges of any intrastate pipeline with respect to any transportation authorized under subparagraph (A), including any amount computed in accordance with the rule prescribed under clause (ii), shall be fair and equitable and may not exceed an amount which is reasonably comparable to the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.
<br>(ii) Commission rule
<br>
<br>The Commission shall, by rule, establish the method for calculating an amount necessary to—
<br>
<br>(I) reasonably compensate any intrastate pipeline for expenses incurred by the pipeline and associated with the providing of any gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery, or similar service provided by such pipeline in connection with any transportation of natural gas authorized under subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(II) provide an opportunity for such pipeline to earn a reasonable profit on such services.
<br>(b) Commission approval of sales
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may, by rule or order, authorize any intrastate pipeline to sell natural gas to—
<br>

<br>
<br>In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the Commission shall permit an adjustment to the maximum fair and equitable price provided under subparagraph (A) to increase the revenue to the intrastate pipeline under such sale by an amount determined by the Commission to be adequate to offset the additional cost incurred by such pipeline due to any increase in such pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas.
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>(A) Two-year duration
<br>
<br>No authorization of any sale (or any extension thereof) under paragraph (1) may be for a period exceeding two years.

<br>(5) Procedural requirements
<br>(A) Affidavit
<br>
<br>Any application for authorization of any sale under paragraph (1) shall be accompanied by an affidavit filed by the intrastate pipeline involved and setting forth—

<br>(6) Termination of sales
<br>(A) Hearing
<br>
<br>Upon complaint of any interested person, or upon the Commission's own motion, the Commission shall, after affording an opportunity for oral presentation of views and arguments, terminate any sale authorized under paragraph (1) if the Commission determines—

<br>(C) Determination
<br>
<br>The determination of whether any interruption of any sale authorized under paragraph (1) is required under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be made by the Commission without regard to the character of the use of natural gas by any customer of the intrastate pipeline involved.
<br>(D) State intervention
<br>
<br>Any interested State may intervene as a matter of right in any proceeding before the Commission relating to any determination under this section.
<br>(7) Disapproval of application

<br>(a) Orders
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The provisions of this subsection shall apply to judicial review of any order, within the meaning of section 551(6) of title 5 (other than an order assessing a civil penalty under section 3414(b)(4) of this title or any order under section 3362 of this title or any order under section 3363 of this title), issued under this chapter and to any final agency action under this chapter required to be made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing.

<br>
<br>(A) such person shall have made application to the Commission for rehearing under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Commission shall have finally acted with respect to such application.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, if the Commission fails to act within 30 days after the filing of such application, such failure to act shall be deemed final agency action with respect to such application.
<br>(3) Authority to modify orders
<br>
<br>At any time before the filing of the record of a proceeding in a United States Court of Appeals, pursuant to paragraph (4), the Commission may, after providing notice it determines reasonable and proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any order issued under the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(4) Judicial review
<br>
<br>Any person who is a party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by any final order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit in which the party to which such order relates is located or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Review shall be obtained by filing a written petition, requesting that such order be modified or set aside in whole or in part, in such Court of Appeals within 60 days after the final action of the Commission on the application for rehearing required under paragraph (2). A copy of such petition shall forthwith be transmitted by the clerk of such court to any member of the Commission and thereupon the Commission shall file with the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order in whole or in part. No objection to such order of the Commission shall be considered by the court if such objection was not urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there was reasonable ground for the failure to do so. The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceedings before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. The Commission shall also file with the court its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Commission, shall be final subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
