<br>
<br>The words "or Regular Air Force" are added for consistency with section 103302 of the new title.
<br>§103302. Camps for military instruction
<br>
<br>(a) Assembling of Forces and Detailing of Instructors.—The Secretary of the Army or Secretary of the Air Force, within the limits of appropriations that may be available for that purpose, may assemble in camp at such season of the year and for such period as the Secretary of the Army or Secretary of the Air Force may designate, at the field of military maneuvers, such portions of the military forces of the United States as the Secretary of the Army or Secretary of the Air Force may think best, to receive military instruction there. The Secretary of the Army of Secretary of the Air Force may detail instructors from the Regular Army or Regular Air Force, respectively, for those forces during their exercises.

<br>
<br>In this section, the words "or Secretary of the Air Force" and "or Regular Air Force" are added because certain functions, personnel, and property, insofar as they pertain to the Air Force, were transferred from the Secretary of the Army and Department of the Army to the Secretary of the Air Force and Department of the Air Force by Secretary of Defense Transfer Order Nos. 1, September 26, 1947; 10, April 27, 1948; and 40 [App. B(65)], July 22, 1949.

<br>
<br>Section 103303 is substituted for 16 U.S.C. 421 to eliminate obsolete words because there no longer are park commissioners for the national military parks. The references to the Secretary of the Army are changed to the Secretary the Interior because the administrative functions of certain national military parks were transferred to the Department of the Interior by section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166, June 10, 1933, and section 1 of Executive Order No. 6228, July 28, 1933, set out as a note under section 901 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. References to the National Park Service were substituted for references to the Office of National Parks, Buildings, and Reservations in section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 because of the last paragraph under the heading "OFFICE OF NATIONAL PARKS, BUILDINGS, AND RESERVATIONS" in section 1 of the Act of March 2, 1934 (ch. 38, 48 Stat. 389).

<br>
<br>(a) Civil Action.—The United States may bring a civil action in the courts of the United States against a person to whom land lying within a national military park has been leased that refuses to give up possession of the land to the United States after the termination of the lease, and after possession has been demanded for the United States by the park superintendent, or against a person retaining possession of land lying within the boundary of a national military park that the person has sold to the United States for park purposes and received payment therefor, after possession of the land has been demanded for the United States by the park superintendent, to recover possession of the land withheld. The civil action shall be brought according to the statutes of the State in which the national military park is situated.
<br>
<br>(b) Trespass.—A person described in subsection (a) shall be guilty of trespass.

<br>(a) Study of Battlefields for Commemorative Purposes.—The Secretary of the Army may make studies and investigations and, where necessary, surveys of all battlefields within the continental limits of the United States on which troops of the United States or of the original 13 colonies have been engaged against a common enemy, with a view to preparing a general plan and such detailed projects as may be required for properly commemorating such battlefields or other adjacent points of historic and military interest.

<br>The word "Secretary" is substituted for "National Park Service" to reflect the transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of the Department of the Interior to the Secretary by sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 (5 U.S.C.

<br>§104906. Protection of right of individuals to bear arms
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The 2d amendment to the Constitution provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed".
<br>
<br>(2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that "except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net".
<br>
<br>(3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the 2d amendment rights of the individuals while at System units.
<br>
<br>(4) The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different System units entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units.
<br>
<br>(5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations relating to the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in System units that went into effect on January 9, 2009—
<br>
<br>(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and
<br>
<br>(B) the new regulations—
<br>
<br>(i) are under review by the Obama administration; and
<br>
<br>(ii) may be altered.
<br>
<br>(6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of System land.
<br>
<br>(7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.
<br>
<br>(b) Protection of Right of Individuals To Bear Arms in System Units.—The Secretary shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm, including an assembled or functional firearm, in any System unit if—
<br>
<br>(1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm; and
<br>
<br>(2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the State in which the System unit is located.

<br>
<br>(1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the bows and crossbows;
<br>
<br>(2) the bows or crossbows that are not ready for immediate use remain inside the vehicle of the individual throughout the period during which the bows or crossbows are transported across System land; and

<br>
<br>(a) Use of Qualified Volunteers.—If the Secretary determines it is necessary to reduce the size of a wildlife population on System land in accordance with applicable law (including regulations), the Secretary may use qualified volunteers to assist in carrying out wildlife management on System land.
<br>
<br>(b) Requirements for Qualified Volunteers.—Qualified volunteers providing assistance under subsection (a) shall be subject to—
<br>
<br>(1) any training requirements or qualifications established by the Secretary; and

<br>
<br>(c) Donations.—The Secretary may authorize the donation and distribution of meat from wildlife management activities carried out under this section, including the donation and distribution to Indian Tribes, qualified volunteers, food banks, and other organizations that work to address hunger, in accordance with applicable health guidelines and such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require.

<br>Executive Documents
<br>A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 16, 2010, 75 F.R. 20767, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Agriculture[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality
<br>
<br>Americans are blessed with a vast and varied natural heritage. From mountains to deserts and from sea to shining sea, America's great outdoors have shaped the rugged independence and sense of community that define the American spirit. Our working landscapes, cultural sites, parks, coasts, wild lands, rivers, and streams are gifts that we have inherited from previous generations. They are the places that offer us refuge from daily demands, renew our spirits, and enhance our fondest memories, whether they are fishing with a grandchild in a favorite spot, hiking a trail with a friend, or enjoying a family picnic in a neighborhood park. They also are our farms, ranches, and forests—the working lands that have fed and sustained us for generations. Americans take pride in these places, and share a responsibility to preserve them for our children and grandchildren.
<br>
<br>Today, however, we are losing touch with too many of the places and proud traditions that have helped to make America special. Farms, ranches, forests, and other valuable natural resources are disappearing at an alarming rate. Families are spending less time together enjoying their natural surroundings. Despite our conservation efforts, too many of our fields are becoming fragmented, too many of our rivers and streams are becoming polluted, and we are losing our connection to the parks, wild places, and open spaces we grew up with and cherish. Children, especially, are spending less time outside running and playing, fishing and hunting, and connecting to the outdoors just down the street or outside of town.
<br>
<br>Across America, communities are uniting to protect the places they love, and developing new approaches to saving and enjoying the outdoors. They are bringing together farmers and ranchers, land trusts, recreation and conservation groups, sportsmen, community park groups, governments and industry, and people from all over the country to develop new partnerships and innovative programs to protect and restore our outdoors legacy. However, these efforts are often scattered and sometimes insufficient. The Federal Government, the Nation's largest land manager, has a responsibility to engage with these partners to help develop a conservation agenda worthy of the 21st Century. We must look to the private sector and nonprofit organizations, as well as towns, cities, and States, and the people who live and work in them, to identify the places that mean the most to Americans, and leverage the support of the Federal Government to help these community-driven efforts to succeed. Through these partnerships, we will work to connect these outdoor spaces to each other, and to reconnect Americans to them.
<br>
<br>For these reasons, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Establishment.
<br>
<br>(a) There is established the America's Great Outdoors Initiative (Initiative), to be led by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and implemented in coordination with the agencies listed in section 2(b) of this memorandum. The Initiative may include the heads of other executive branch departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) as the President may, from time to time, designate.
<br>
<br>(b) The goals of the Initiative shall be to:
<br>
<br>(i) Reconnect Americans, especially children, to America's rivers and waterways, landscapes of national significance, ranches, farms and forests, great parks, and coasts and beaches by exploring a variety of efforts, including:
<br>
<br>(A) promoting community-based recreation and conservation, including local parks, greenways, beaches, and waterways;
<br>
<br>(B) advancing job and volunteer opportunities related to conservation and outdoor recreation; and
<br>
<br>(C) supporting existing programs and projects that educate and engage Americans in our history, culture, and natural bounty.
<br>
<br>(ii) Build upon State, local, private, and tribal priorities for the conservation of land, water, wildlife, historic, and cultural resources, creating corridors and connectivity across these outdoor spaces, and for enhancing neighborhood parks; and determine how the Federal Government can best advance those priorities through public private partnerships and locally supported conservation strategies.
<br>
<br>(iii) Use science-based management practices to restore and protect our lands and waters for future generations.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Functions. The functions of the Initiative shall include:
<br>
<br>(a) Outreach. The Initiative shall conduct listening and learning sessions around the country where land and waters are being conserved and community parks are being established in innovative ways. These sessions should engage the full range of interested groups, including tribal leaders, farmers and ranchers, sportsmen, community park groups, foresters, youth groups, businesspeople, educators, State and local governments, and recreation and conservation groups. Special attention should be given to bringing young Americans into the conversation. These listening sessions will inform the reports required in subsection (c) of this section.
<br>
<br>(b) Interagency Coordination. The following agencies shall work with the Initiative to identify existing resources and align policies and programs to achieve its goals:
<br>
<br>(i) the Department of Defense;
<br>
<br>(ii) the Department of Commerce;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;
<br>
<br>(iv) the Department of Health and Human Services;
<br>
<br>(v) the Department of Labor;
<br>
<br>(vi) the Department of Transportation;
<br>
<br>(vii) the Department of Education; and
<br>
<br>(viii) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
<br>
<br>(c) Reports. The Initiative shall submit, through the Chair of the CEQ, the following reports to the President:
<br>
<br>(i) Report on America's Great Outdoors. By November 15, 2010, the Initiative shall submit a report that includes the following:
<br>
<br>(A) a review of successful and promising nonfederal conservation approaches;
<br>
<br>(B) an analysis of existing Federal resources and programs that could be used to complement those approaches;
<br>
<br>(C) proposed strategies and activities to achieve the goals of the Initiative; and
<br>
<br>(D) an action plan to meet the goals of the Initiative.
<br>
<br>The report should reflect the constraints in resources available in, and be consistent with, the Federal budget. It should recommend efficient and effective use of existing resources, as well as opportunities to leverage nonfederal public and private resources and nontraditional conservation programs.
<br>
<br>(ii) Annual reports. By September 30, 2011, and September 30, 2012, the Initiative shall submit reports on its progress in implementing the action plan developed pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(D) of this section.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions.
<br>
<br>(a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of any necessary appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Initiative, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Initiative. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses of participating in the Initiative.
<br>
<br>(d) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(e) The Chair of the CEQ is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 11200, Feb. 26, 1965, 30 F.R. 2645, provided:
<br>
<br>WHEREAS it is desirable that all American people of present and future generations be assured adequate outdoor recreation resources, and it is desirable for all levels of government and private interests to take prompt and coordinated action to the extent practicable without diminishing or affecting their respective powers and functions to conserve, develop, and utilize such resources for the benefit and enjoyment of the American people; and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS these resources are to a considerable extent located on lands administered by the Federal Government through the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Forest Service, the Corps of Engineers, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (United States and Mexico); and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Act of May 28, 1963, 77 Stat. 49 [see 54 U.S.C. 200101 et seq.], vested the Secretary of the Interior with legal authority to promote coordination of Federal plans and activities generally relating to outdoor recreation; and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS it is fair and equitable that the users of certain recreation areas and facilities managed by such agencies pay a reasonable fee for the recreation benefits received; and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS it is desirable to establish uniformity of practices among such Federal agencies regarding recreation user fees and related matters; and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Congress, recognizing the need for urgent and effective action in this regard, enacted the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, Public Law 88–578; 78 Stat. 897 [see 54 U.S.C. 200301 et seq.] (hereafter in this order referred to as "the Act");
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Act, by Section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Designation of areas for 1965. (a) All areas administered by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, Bureau of Reclamation, Forest Service, Corps of Engineers, Tennessee Valley Authority, and the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (United States and Mexico), at which entrance, admission, or other recreation user fees (hereafter in this order referred to as "recreation user fees") were collected directly by those Federal agencies during any part of 1964 are hereby designated, pursuant to Section 2(a) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a)], as areas at which recreation user fees shall be charged during 1965.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Defense, the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Commissioner, United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (United States and Mexico), or their designees, shall, by April 1, 1965, designate any additional areas under their respective jurisdictions at which recreation user fees are to be charged during 1965.
<br>
<br>(c) Recreation user fees for such areas shall be prescribed as provided in Section 5 of this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Designation of areas for years after 1965. (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the areas designated by Section 1(a), or pursuant to Section 1(b), of this Order are hereby designated as areas for which recreation user fees shall be charged for years after 1965.
<br>
<br>(b) The officials described in Section 1(b) of this Order shall, before January 1, 1966, and at least annually thereafter, review all areas then under their respective jurisdictions, including those described in subsection (a) of this section, to determine (1) whether any additional areas should, in accordance with the designation criteria prescribed by Section 3 of this Order (or under those designation criteria as revised by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Order), be designated as areas for which recreation user fees shall be charged, or (2) whether the recreation user fee for any area theretofore designated should be increased, reduced, or eliminated under the designation criteria then in effect.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Whenever, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, it is determined that the recreation user fee for an area should be reduced or eliminated, such action shall be taken forthwith.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, it is determined that a recreation user fee should be charged with respect to an area with respect to which no such fee has theretofore been charged, such new fee shall be charged only after the posting requirements of Section 4 of this Order have been satisfied.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Criteria for designation of areas. Areas shall, in accordance with Section 1(b) and Section 2(b) of this Order and to the extent permitted by the Act, be designated as areas at which recreation user fees shall be charged if the following conditions are found to exist concurrently:
<br>
<br>(1) The area is administered by any of the eight agencies specified in Section 1(a) of this Order;
<br>
<br>(2) The area is administered primarily for scenic, scientific, historical, cultural, or recreational purposes;
<br>
<br>(3) The area has recreation facilities or services provided at Federal expense; and
<br>
<br>(4) The nature of the area is such that fee collection is administratively and economically practical.
<br>
<br>(b) Areas designated as those at which recreation user fees shall be charged shall hereafter in this Order be referred to as "designated areas."
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Posting of designated areas. The heads of administering agencies and departments shall provide for the posting of signs at all designated areas such as will clearly notify the visiting public that recreation user fees are charged therein.

No recreation user fee established pursuant to this Order shall be effective with respect to any designated area until that designated area has been posted.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Establishment of fees. (a) Each official described in Section 1(b) of this Order shall, subject to the criteria prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, establish a recreation user fee for each designated area administered under his jurisdiction by selecting from a schedule of fees, prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to Section 6 of this Order, the fee which is appropriate for each such designated area under criteria prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to that section. Each such official shall also specify which designated areas shall be excluded from the coverage of the annual fee described in Section 2(a)(1) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a)(i)] and which, as a result of that exclusion will be subject to the fee described in Section 2(a)(iii) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a)(iii)]. The range of recreation user fees to be charged and the criteria for their selection shall be established under the procedures prescribed by Section 6 of this Order.

<br>(b) The Secretary of the Interior shall prescribe the procedures for the production, distribution, and sale of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Sticker, which shall be issued to those individuals who elect to pay the annual fees. The Secretary of the Interior shall also prescribe the manner in which the Sticker shall be displayed. The conditions under which it may be used shall be determinated under the procedures prescribed by Section 6 of this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Coordination. (a) The Secretary of the Interior shall after consultation with the heads of other affected departments and agencies, adopt such coordination measures as are necessary to carry out the purposes of Sections 2(a) and 4(a) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a), 460l–7(a)] and the provisions of this order.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) In order that the purposes of the Act and of this Order may be effectuated without delay, the Secretary of the Interior shall, subject to the limitations imposed by the Act and without regard to the other provisions of this section, forthwith issue a schedule of recreation user fees and criteria to be used in determining which such fees shall be charged with respect to each of the designated areas.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to the limitations imposed by the Act and subject to the provisions of subsections (a), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary of the Interior may, from time to time, amend or replace the schedule of fees and the criteria prescribed by him pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section.
<br>
<br>(c) Subject to the limits set forth in the Act, the measures which the Secretary of the Interior may adopt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may include, but are not limited to, the following—
<br>
<br>(1) Initial preparation and coordination of the comprehensive statement of estimated requirements during the ensuing fiscal year for appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, as required by Section 4(a) of the act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–7(a)].
<br>
<br>(2) Development of such additional procedures and interpretive materials as are necessary to facilitate the implementation of this Order and related provisions of the Act.
<br>
<br>(3) Review and revision, if needed, of the criteria for designation set forth in Section 3 of this Order.
<br>
<br>(d) Except with respect to the schedule of fees and the criteria prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section, measures and regulations adopted by the Secretary pursuant to this Order shall not become effective until 30 days after they are presented for the consideration of the other officials described in Section 1(b). Any such official who does not concur in any such measure or regulation may, within that 30-day period, refer the matter to the Recreation Advisory Council established under Executive Order No. 11017 [superseded by Ex. Ord. No. 11278, which in turn was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11472, which is set out as a note under section 4321 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] for resolution. If a proposed measure is referred to the Council for resolution, it shall not become effective until approved by the Council. With the approval of all other officials described in Section 1(b) of this Order, the provisions of this subsection may be waived with respect to any specific measure or regulation adopted by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to this order so that any such measure or regulation may be made effective before the expiration of the 30-day waiting period prescribed by the first sentence of this subsection.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Review of contracts. The officials described in Section 1(b) of this Order shall, within a reasonable time, review all existing contracts and other arrangements between their respective agencies and any non-Federal public entity which relate to non-Federal management of Federally-owned outdoor recreation areas. Special attention shall be given to any provision in any such contract or other arrangement which prohibits or discourages in any way such non-Federal public entity from charging recreation user fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, each such restrictive provision shall be the subject of renegotiation designed to accomplish a modification thereof that will permit the charging of recreation user fees.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. Regulations. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out his functions under this Order.

<br>
<br>(3) The total allocation to a State under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to all of the States in any one year.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall notify each State of its apportionments. The amounts shall be available for payment to the State for planning, acquisition, or development projects as prescribed. Any amount of any apportionment that has not been paid or obligated by the Secretary during the fiscal year in which the notification is given and for 2 fiscal years thereafter shall be reapportioned by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) without regard to the 10 percent limitation to an individual State specified in this subsection.
<br>
<br>(c) Matching Requirements.—Payments to any State shall cover not more than 50 percent of the cost of planning, acquisition, or development projects that are undertaken by the State. The remaining share of the cost shall be borne by the State in a manner and with funds or services as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(d) Comprehensive State Plan.—
<br>
<br>(1) Required for consideration of financial assistance.—A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall be required prior to the consideration by the Secretary of financial assistance for acquisition or development projects. The plan shall be adequate if, in the judgment of the Secretary, it encompasses and will promote the purposes of this chapter. No plan shall be approved unless the chief executive official of the State certifies that ample opportunity for public participation in plan development and revision has been accorded. The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with others, criteria for public participation, which criteria shall constitute the basis for the certification by the chief executive official. The plan shall contain—
<br>
<br>(A) the name of the State agency that will have authority to represent and act for the State in dealing with the Secretary for purposes of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(B) an evaluation of the demand for and supply of outdoor recreation resources and facilities in the State;
<br>
<br>(C) a program for the implementation of the plan; and
<br>
<br>(D) other necessary information, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Factors to be considered.—The plan shall take into account relevant Federal resources and programs and shall be correlated so far as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans. Where there exists or is in preparation for any particular State a comprehensive plan financed in part with funds supplied by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, any statewide outdoor recreation plan prepared for purposes of this part shall be based on the same population, growth, and other pertinent factors as are used in formulating plans financed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
<br>
<br>(3) Provision of assistance when plan not otherwise available or to maintain plan.—The Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for projects for the preparation of a comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan when the plan is not otherwise available or for the maintenance of the plan.
<br>
<br>(4) Wetlands.—A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall specifically address wetlands within the State as an important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite to approval, except that a revised comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall not be required by the Secretary, if a State submits, and the Secretary, acting through the Director, approves, as a part of and as an addendum to the existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan, a wetlands priority plan developed in consultation with the State agency with responsibility for fish and wildlife resources and consistent with the national wetlands priority conservation plan developed under section 301 of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3921) or, if the national plan has not been completed, consistent with the provisions of that section.
<br>
<br>(e) Projects for Land and Water Acquisition and Development of Basic Outdoor Recreation Facilities.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—In addition to assistance for planning projects, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for the types of projects described in paragraphs (2) and (3), or combinations of those projects, if the projects are in accordance with the State comprehensive plan.
<br>
<br>(2) Acquisition of land or water.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United States for less than fair market value), but not including incidental costs relating to acquisition.
<br>
<br>(B) Retention of right of use and occupancy.—When a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain such a right—
<br>
<br>(i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and
<br>
<br>(ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601).
<br>
<br>(3) Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities.—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to serve the general public, including the development of Federal land under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions and the increased public use made possible by the construction.
<br>
<br>(f) Payments.—
<br>
<br>(1) Criteria for making payments.—The Secretary may make a payment to a State only for a planning, acquisition, or development project that is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not make a payment for or on account of any project with respect to which financial assistance has been given or promised under any other Federal program or activity, and no financial assistance shall be given under any other Federal program or activity for or on account of any project with respect to which the assistance has been given or promised under this chapter. The Secretary may make payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written assurance from the State that the State has the ability and intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for public outdoor recreation use.
<br>
<br>(2) Payment recipients.—Payments for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to a State official or agency designated by the chief executive official or by State law having authority and responsibility to accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other appropriate public agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use.—No property acquired or developed with assistance under this section shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion.
<br>
<br>(4) Reports and accounting procedures.—No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to—
<br>
<br>(A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(g) Records.—A recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records that fully disclose—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount and the disposition by the recipient of the proceeds of the assistance;
<br>
<br>(2) the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which the assistance is given or used; and
<br>
<br>(3) the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.
<br>
<br>(h) Access to Records.—The Secretary, and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(i) Prohibition of Discrimination.—With respect to property acquired or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on the basis of residence.
<br>
<br>(j) Coordination With Federal Agencies.—To ensure consistency in policies and actions under this chapter with other related Federal programs and activities and to ensure coordination of the planning, acquisition, and development assistance to States under this section with other related Federal programs and activities—
<br>
<br>(1) the President may issue such regulations with respect thereto as the President considers desirable; and
<br>
<br>(2) the assistance may be provided only in accordance with the regulations.
<br>
<br>(k) Capital Improvement and Other Projects To Reduce Crime.—
<br>
<br>(1) Availability and purpose of funds.—In addition to assistance for planning projects, and in addition to the projects identified in subsection (e), and from amounts appropriated out of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to the States, not to exceed $15,000,000, for projects or combinations thereof for the purpose of making capital improvements and other measures to increase safety in urban parks and recreation areas, including funds to—
