<br>§1101. Definitions
<br>
<br>In this chapter—
<br>
<br>(1) "agency" includes the District of Columbia government but does not include the legislative branch or the Supreme Court.
<br>
<br>(2) "appropriations" means appropriated amounts and includes, in appropriate context—
<br>
<br>(A) funds;
<br>
<br>(B) authority to make obligations by contract before appropriations; and
<br>
<br>(C) other authority making amounts available for obligation or expenditure.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes Revised Section	Source (U.S. Code)	Source (Statutes at Large)
<br>1101(1) 	31:2(1st–4th pars.). 	June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §2(1st–5th pars.), 42 Stat. 20; Apr. 3, 1939, ch. 36, §201, 53 Stat. 565; July 31, 1953, ch. 302, §101(1st proviso in par. under heading "Bureau of the Budget"), 67 Stat. 299.
<br>1101(2) 	31:2(last par.). 	June 10, 1921, ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20, §2(last par.); added Sept. 12, 1950, ch. 946, §101, 64 Stat. 832.
<br>
<br>In the section, a reference to 31:71 and 471 is omitted because the definitions in the section are not used in 31:71 and 471.
<br>
<br>In clause (1), "agency" (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term "department or establishment" which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning "any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board". This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words "includes the District of Columbia government" are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93–198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words "of the United States" are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2(2d–4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2(3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.

In order to carry out the provisions of Section 1 of this order, the Director shall maintain a continuing study for the improvement of the statistical work of the agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government with a view to obtaining the maximum benefit from the funds and facilities available for such work, giving due consideration to the constantly changing character of the various needs for statistical information both within and without the Government and, where the statistical work is primarily concerned with operating programs, giving due consideration to administrative needs, statutory requirements, and the needs involved in the development of administrative and legislative recommendations. The Director, either upon his own initiative or upon the request of any such agency, shall (a) provide for the interchange of information calculated to improve statistical work, (b) make appropriate arrangements for improving statistical work involving relationships between two or more agencies, and (c) assist the agencies, by other means, to improve their statistical work.

<br>
<br>(a) To achieve an adequate program of statistical work in the agencies of the executive branch, in relation to over-all needs for statistical information, including the filling of gaps and overcoming of weaknesses in presently available statistical information.

<br>
<br>Sec. 5. In the development of programs and the preparation of regulations and orders for issuance pursuant to Section 1 hereof, the Director shall consult Federal agencies whose activities will be substantially affected, and may consult non-Federal groups to the extent he finds it necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. The authority outlined in this order is in addition to and not in substitution for the existing authority of the Director, or of the Office of Management and Budget, with respect to statistical and reporting activities.
