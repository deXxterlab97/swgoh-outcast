<br>§3201. Findings and purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress, after careful review of the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations and the historical and special relationship of the Federal Government with Indian people,
<br>
<br>(1) finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) incidents of abuse of children on Indian reservations are grossly underreported;
<br>
<br>(B) such underreporting is often a result of the lack of a mandatory Federal reporting law;
<br>
<br>(C) multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been perpetrated by persons employed or funded by the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(D) Federal Government investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for, or teach, Indian children are often deficient;
<br>
<br>(E) funds spent by the United States on Indian reservations or otherwise spent for the benefit of Indians who are victims of child abuse or family violence are inadequate to meet the growing needs for mental health treatment and counseling for victims of child abuse or family violence and their families; and
<br>
<br>(F) there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe; and
<br>
<br>(2) declares that two major goals of the United States are to—
<br>
<br>(A) identify the scope of incidents of abuse of children and family violence in Indian country and to reduce such incidents; and
<br>
<br>(B) provide funds for mental health treatment for Indian victims of child abuse and family violence on Indian reservations.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are to—
<br>
<br>(1) require that reports of abused Indian children are made to the appropriate authorities in an effort to prevent further abuse;
<br>
<br>(2) establish a reliable data base for statistical purposes and to authorize a study to determine the need for a central registry for reported incidents of abuse;
<br>
<br>(3) authorize such other actions as are necessary to ensure effective child protection in Indian country;
<br>
<br>(4) establish the Indian Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grant Program to provide funds for the establishment on Indian reservations of treatment programs for victims of child sexual abuse;
<br>
<br>(5) provide for technical assistance and training related to the investigation and treatment of cases of child abuse and neglect;
<br>
<br>(6) establish Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers in each Bureau of Indian Affairs Area Office which will consist of multi-disciplinary teams of personnel with experience and training in the prevention, identification, investigation, and treatment of child abuse and neglect;
<br>
<br>(7) provide for the treatment and prevention of incidents of family violence;
<br>
<br>(8) establish tribally operated programs to protect Indian children and reduce the incidents of family violence in Indian country; and
<br>
<br>(9) authorize other actions necessary to ensure effective child protection on Indian reservations.

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 102–325, title XIII, §1311, July 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 798.)
<br>§3302. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;
<br>
<br>(2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;
<br>
<br>(3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;
<br>
<br>(4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
<br>
<br>(5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;
<br>
<br>(6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and
<br>
<br>(7) these services are part of the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.

<br>An Indian tribe which has qualified under subsection (a) or (b) for a grant under this subchapter for any fiscal year shall continue to be eligible for such a grant for each succeeding fiscal year unless the Secretary revokes such eligibility for a cause described in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Causes for loss of eligibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary may revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter if such tribe—
<br>
<br>(A) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual financial statement that reports revenues and expenditures determined by use of an accounting system, established by the tribe, that complies with generally accepted accounting principles;
<br>
<br>(B) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual program description, stating the number of students served, and containing such information concerning such students, their educational programs and progress, and the financial assistance distributed to such students as the Secretary may require by regulation;
<br>
<br>(C) fails to submit to the Secretary a biennial financial audit conducted in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31; or
<br>
<br>(D) fails, in an evaluation of its financial assistance program conducted by an impartial third party entity, to comply with standards under this subchapter relating to (i) eligible students, programs, or institutions of higher education, (ii) satisfactory progress, or (iii) allowable administrative costs; as determined under contracts applicable to programs to provide financial assistance to individual Indian students for the cost of attendance at institutions of higher education administered by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] and in effect on January 20, 1991.
<br>(3) Procedures for revocation of eligibility

<br>(A) after notice in writing to the tribe of the cause and opportunity to the tribe to correct;
<br>
<br>(B) providing technical assistance to the tribe in making such corrections; and

<br>§3305. Allocation of grant funds
<br>(a) Allocation of funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall continue to determine the amount of program funds to be received by each grantee under this subchapter by the same method used for determining such distribution in fiscal year 1991 for tribally-administered and Bureau-administered programs of grants to individual Indians to defray postsecondary expenses.
<br>(2) Administrative costs
<br>
<br>In addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1), a grantee which has exercised the option given in section 3304(a) of this title to administer the program under a grant shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the method used by the grantee during the preceding contract period. All other grantees shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the regulations governing such determinations under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], as in effect at the time of application to grants being made.
<br>(3) Single grant; separate accounts
<br>
<br>Each grantee shall receive only one grant during any fiscal year, which shall include both of the amounts under paragraphs (1) and (2). Each grantee shall maintain this grant in a separate account.
<br>(b) Use of funds
<br>
<br>Funds provided by grants under this subchapter shall be used—
<br>
<br>(1) to make grants to individual Indian students to meet, on the basis of need, any educational expense of attendance in a postsecondary education program (as determined under the contracts applying to the postsecondary education program administered by tribes under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93–638) [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.]), to the extent that such expense is not met from other sources or cannot be defrayed through the action of any State, Federal, or municipal Act, except that nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring any priority in consideration of resources; and
<br>
<br>(2) costs of administering the program under this subchapter, except that no more may be spent on administration of such program than is generated by the method for administrative cost computation specified in subsection (a)(2).
