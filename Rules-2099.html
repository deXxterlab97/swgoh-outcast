<br>§50305. Appointment of trustee or receiver and operation of vessels
<br>
<br>(a) Appointment of Trustees and Receivers.—
<br>
<br>(1) Appointment of secretary.—In a proceeding in a court of the United States in which a trustee or receiver may be appointed for a corporation operating a vessel of United States registry between the United States and a foreign country, on which the United States Government holds a mortgage, the court may appoint the Secretary of Transportation as the sole trustee or receiver (subject to the direction of the court) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the court finds that the appointment will—
<br>
<br>(i) inure to the advantage of the estate and the parties in interest; and
<br>
<br>(ii) tend to carry out the purposes of this subtitle; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary expressly consents to the appointment.
<br>
<br>(2) Appointment of other person.—The appointment of another person as trustee or receiver without a hearing becomes effective when ratified by the Secretary, but the Secretary may demand a hearing.
<br>
<br>(b) Operation of Vessels.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—If the court is unwilling to allow the trustee or receiver to operate the vessel in foreign commerce without financial aid from the Government pending termination of the proceeding, and the Secretary certifies to the court that the continued operation of the vessel is essential to the foreign commerce of the United States and is reasonably calculated to carry out the purposes of this subtitle, the court may allow the Secretary to operate the vessel, either directly or through a managing agent or operator employed by the Secretary. The Secretary must agree to comply with terms imposed by the court sufficient to protect the parties in interest. The Secretary also must agree to pay all operating losses resulting from the operation. The operation shall be for the account of the trustee or receiver.
<br>
<br>(2) Payment of operating losses and other amounts.—The Secretary has no claim against the corporation, its estate, or its assets for operating losses paid by the Secretary, but the Secretary may pay amounts for depreciation the Secretary considers reasonable and other amounts the court considers just. The payment of operating losses and the other amounts and compliance with terms imposed by the court shall be in satisfaction of any claim against the Secretary resulting from the operation of the vessel.
<br>
<br>(3) Deemed operation by government.—A vessel operated by the Secretary under this subsection is deemed to be a vessel operated by the United States under chapter 309 of this title.

<br>In subsection (a), the words "and with respect to a corporation under subchapter VI of this chapter, all directors of the corporation are citizens of the United States" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1244(c) are omitted because part A of subchapter VI contains the operating-differential subsidy program which, under 46 App. U.S.C. 1185a, is being phased out, and part B of subchapter VI contains the Maritime Security Fleet program which is being repealed (effective October 1, 2005) and replaced by chapter 531 of title 46 as enacted by the Maritime Security Act of 2003. Thus, subchapter VI is being omitted from the revised title and will instead appear as a note under section 53101. The words "and, in the case of a corporation, partnership, or association operating a vessel on the Great Lakes, or on bays, sounds, rivers, harbors, or inland lakes of the United States the amount of interest required to be owned by a citizen of the United States shall be not less than 75 per centum" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1244(c) are omitted as covered by the 75 percent ownership requirement for operation in the coastwise trade.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "Territory, District, or possession thereof" are omitted because of the definition of "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

<br>The definitions of "oceanographic research vessel" and "scientific personnel" in 46 App. U.S.C. 441 are omitted because substantially the same definitions are already in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
<br>
<br>The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 444 is omitted because section 10101(3) of title 46, which defines "seaman" for purposes of part G of subtitle II of title 46, already contains an exception for scientific personnel. Title 53 of the Revised Statutes, referred to [in] 46 App. U.S.C. 444, was previously codified principally in part G of subtitle II of title 46.

<br>(2) a vessel engaged in trade or commerce.
<br>
<br>(d) Evidence of Financial Responsibility.—The owner or charterer of a sailing school vessel shall maintain evidence of financial responsibility to meet liability for death or injury to sailing school students and sailing school instructors on a voyage on the vessel. The amount of financial responsibility shall be at least $50,000 for each student and instructor. Financial responsibility under this subsection may be evidenced by insurance or other adequate financial resources.
