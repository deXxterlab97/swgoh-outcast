<br>(A) Fiscal year 2018
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2018, fees under subsection (a) shall be established to generate a total estimated revenue amount under such subsection of $493,600,000.
<br>(B) Fiscal years 2019 through 2022
<br>
<br>For each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2022, fees under paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (a) shall be established to generate a total estimated revenue amount under such subsection that is equal to $493,600,000, as adjusted pursuant to subsection (c).
<br>(2) Types of fees
<br>
<br>In establishing fees under paragraph (1) to generate the revenue amounts specified in such paragraph for a fiscal year, such fees shall be derived from the fees under paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (a) as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) Five percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(2) (relating to drug master files).
<br>
<br>(B) Thirty-three percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(3) (relating to abbreviated new drug applications).
<br>
<br>(C) Twenty percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(4)(A)(i) (relating to generic drug facilities). The amount of the fee for a contract manufacturing organization facility shall be equal to one-third the amount of the fee for a facility that is not a contract manufacturing organization facility. The amount of the fee for a facility located outside the United States and its territories and possessions shall be $15,000 higher than the amount of the fee for a facility located in the United States and its territories and possessions.
<br>
<br>(D) Seven percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(4)(A)(ii) (relating to active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities). The amount of the fee for a facility located outside the United States and its territories and possessions shall be $15,000 higher than the amount of the fee for a facility located in the United States, including its territories and possessions.
<br>
<br>(E)(i) Thirty-five percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(5) (relating to generic drug applicant program fees). For purposes of this subparagraph, if a person has affiliates, a single program fee shall be assessed with respect to that person, including its affiliates, and may be paid by that person or any one of its affiliates. The Secretary shall determine the fees as follows:
<br>
<br>(I) If a person (including its affiliates) owns at least one but not more than 5 approved abbreviated new drug applications on the due date for the fee under this subsection, the person (including its affiliates) shall be assessed a small business generic drug applicant program fee equal to one-tenth of the large size operation generic drug applicant program fee.
<br>
<br>(II) If a person (including its affiliates) owns at least 6 but not more than 19 approved abbreviated new drug applications on the due date for the fee under this subsection, the person (including its affiliates) shall be assessed a medium size operation generic drug applicant program fee equal to two-fifths of the large size operation generic drug applicant program fee.
<br>
<br>(III) If a person (including its affiliates) owns 20 or more approved abbreviated new drug applications on the due date for the fee under this subsection, the person (including its affiliates) shall be assessed a large size operation generic drug applicant program fee.
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, an abbreviated new drug application shall be deemed not to be approved if the applicant has submitted a written request for withdrawal of approval of such abbreviated new drug application by April 1 of the previous fiscal year.
<br>(c) Adjustments
<br>(1) Inflation adjustment
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenues established in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, to equal the product of the total revenues established in such notice for the prior fiscal year multiplied by an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) one;
<br>
<br>(B) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years multiplied by the proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of human generic drug activities for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years; and
<br>
<br>(C) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC–MD–VA–WV; Not Seasonally Adjusted; All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years of available data multiplied by the proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of human generic drug activities for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years.
<br>(2) Final year adjustment
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2022, the Secretary may, in addition to adjustments under paragraph (1), further increase the fee revenues and fees established in subsection (b) if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for not more than 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for human generic drug activities for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2023. If such an adjustment is necessary, the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice establishing fee revenues and fees for fiscal year 2022. If the Secretary has carryover balances for such activities in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, the adjustment under this subparagraph shall not be made.
<br>(d) Annual fee setting
<br>(1) Fiscal years 2018 through 2022
<br>
<br>Not more than 60 days before the first day of each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022, the Secretary shall establish the fees described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (a), based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under subsection (c).
<br>(2) Fee for active pharmaceutical ingredient information not included by reference to Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient drug master file
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the total number of such active pharmaceutical ingredients in such submission; and
<br>
<br>(ii) for each such ingredient that is manufactured at more than one such facility, the total number of such additional facilities; and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount equal to the drug master file fee established in subsection (a)(2) for such submission.

<br>(i) reduce the fee revenue and fees under this section as the Secretary determines appropriate for long-term financial planning purposes; or
<br>
<br>(ii) increase the fee revenue and fees under this section if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for not more than 21 weeks of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.
<br>(C) Federal Register notice
<br>
<br>If an adjustment under subparagraph (A) or (B) is made, the rationale for the amount of the increase or decrease (as applicable) in fee revenue and fees shall be contained in the annual Federal Register notice under paragraph (5)(B) establishing fee revenue and fees for the fiscal year involved.
<br>(4) Fiscal year 2018 adjustment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2018, the Secretary shall adjust the fee revenue and fees under this section in such amount (if any) as needed to reflect an updated assessment of the workload for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.
<br>(B) Methodology
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall publish under paragraph (5)(B) a description of the methodology used to calculate the fiscal year 2018 adjustment under this paragraph in the Federal Register notice establishing fee revenue and fees for fiscal year 2018.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>No adjustment under this paragraph shall result in an increase in fee revenue and fees under this section in excess of $9,000,000.
<br>(5) Annual fee setting
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2018 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days before the start of each such fiscal year—
<br>
<br>(A) establish, for the fiscal year, initial and annual biosimilar biological product development fees and reactivation fees under subsection (a)(1), biosimilar biological product application fees under subsection (a)(2), and biosimilar biological product program fees under subsection (a)(3), based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) publish such fee revenue and fees in the Federal Register.
<br>(6) Limit
<br>
<br>The total amount of fees assessed for a fiscal year under this section may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.
<br>(d) Application fee waiver for small business
<br>(1) Waiver of application fee
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall grant to a person who is named in a biosimilar biological product application a waiver from the application fee assessed to that person under subsection (a)(2)(A) for the first biosimilar biological product application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent biosimilar biological product applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the same manner as an entity that is not a small business.
<br>(2) Considerations
<br>
<br>In determining whether to grant a waiver of a fee under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider only the circumstances and assets of the applicant involved and any affiliate of the applicant.
<br>(3) Small business defined
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "small business" means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, and does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application (as defined in section 379g of this title) or a biosimilar biological product application (as defined in section 379j–51(4) of this title) and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
<br>(e) Effect of failure to pay fees
<br>
<br>A biosimilar biological product application or supplement submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all such fees owed by such person have been paid.
<br>(f) Crediting and availability of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.
<br>(2) Collections and appropriation Acts
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), the fees authorized by this section shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year.
<br>(B) Use of fees and limitations
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The fees authorized by this section shall be available for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2012 to defray the costs of the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications (including such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process), only if the Secretary allocates for such purpose an amount for such fiscal year (excluding amounts from fees collected under this section) no less than $20,000,000, multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
<br>(ii) Leasing and necessary equipment
<br>
<br>Beginning on October 1, 2023, the authorities under section 379j–51(9)(C) of this title shall include only leasing and necessary scientific equipment.
<br>(C) Compliance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (B) in any fiscal year if the costs described in such subparagraph are not more than 15 percent below the level specified in such subparagraph.
<br>(D) Provision for early payments
<br>
<br>Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.
<br>(3) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>For each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equivalent to the total amount of fees assessed for such fiscal year under this section.
<br>(g) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
<br>(h) Written requests for waivers and refunds
<br>
<br>To qualify for consideration for a waiver under subsection (d), or for a refund of any fee collected in accordance with subsection (a)(2)(A), a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such waiver or refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.
<br>(i) Construction
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employers, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of biosimilar biological product applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.
