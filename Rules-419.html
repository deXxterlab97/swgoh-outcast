<br>
<br>(2) Whenever in the judgment of the Board such action will reduce the risk or avert a threatened loss to the fund and will facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union with another insured credit union, or will facilitate the sale of the assets of an open or closed insured credit union to and assumption of its liability by another person, the Board may, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, make loans secured in whole or in part by assets of an open or closed insured credit union, which loans may be in subordination to the rights of members and creditors of such credit union, or the Board may purchase any of such assets or may guarantee any person against loss by reason of its assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of an open or closed insured credit union. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "person" means any credit union, individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.
<br>
<br>(3) No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the right, title, or interest of the Board, in any asset acquired by it under this subsection, either as security for a loan or by purchase, shall be valid against the Board unless such agreement—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be in writing;

<br>(B) shall have been executed by the credit union and the person or persons claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the credit union;
<br>
<br>(C) shall have been approved by the board of directors of the credit union, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of such board; and
<br>
<br>(D) shall have been continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the credit union.

<br>§1790. Nondiscriminatory provision
<br>
<br>It is not the purpose of this subchapter to discriminate in any manner against State-chartered credit unions and in favor of Federal credit unions, but it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide all credit unions with the same opportunity to obtain and enjoy the benefits of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(June 26, 1934, ch. 750, title II, §211, formerly §210, as added Pub. L. 91–468, §1(3), Oct. 19, 1970, 84 Stat. 1015; renumbered §211, Pub. L. 95–147, §2(c)(2), Oct. 28, 1977, 91 Stat. 1228.)

<br>(a) Prior notice required
<br>
<br>An insured credit union shall notify the Board of the proposed addition of any individual to the board of directors or committee or the employment of any individual as a senior executive officer of such credit union at least 30 days before such addition or employment becomes effective, if the insured credit union—
<br>
<br>(1) has been chartered less than 2 years; or
<br>
<br>(2) is in troubled condition, as determined on the basis of such credit union's most recent report of condition or report of examination.
<br>(b) Disapproval by Board
<br>
<br>An insured credit union may not add any individual to the board of directors or employ any individual as a senior executive officer if the Board issues a notice of disapproval of such addition or employment before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the agency receives notice of the proposed action pursuant to subsection (a).
<br>(c) Exception in extraordinary circumstances
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Board may prescribe by regulation conditions under which the prior notice requirement of subsection (a) may be waived in the event of extraordinary circumstances.
<br>(2) No effect on disapproval authority of Board
<br>
<br>Such waivers shall not affect the authority of the Board to issue notices of disapproval of such additions or employment of such individuals within 30 days after each such waiver.
<br>(d) Additional information
<br>
<br>Any notice submitted to the Board by any insured credit union pursuant to subsection (a) shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) the information described in section 1817(j)(6)(A) of this title about the individual; and
<br>
<br>(2) such other information as the Board may prescribe by regulation.
<br>(e) Standard for disapproval
<br>
<br>The Board shall issue a notice of disapproval with respect to a notice submitted pursuant to subsection (a) if the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual with respect to whom such notice is submitted indicates that it would not be in the best interests of the depositors of the insured credit union or in the best interests of the public to permit the individual to be employed by, or associated with, such insured credit union.
<br>(f) Definition regulations
<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe by regulation a definition for the terms "troubled condition" and "senior executive officer" for purposes of subsection (a).

<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Section 914(b) of Pub. L. 101–73, which directed that this section be added to title II of "the Federal Credit Union Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1781 et seq.)" was executed by adding this section to the Federal Credit Union Act, which comprises this chapter, as the probable intent of Congress.
<br>§1790b. Credit union employee protection remedy
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Employees of credit unions
<br>
<br>No insured credit union may discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee) provided information to the Board or the Attorney General regarding any possible violation of any law or regulation by the credit union or any director, officer, or employee of the credit union.
<br>(2) Employees of the Administration
<br>
<br>The Administration may not discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee (including any employee of the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility) with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee) provided information to the Administration or the Attorney General regarding any possible violation of any law or regulation by—
<br>
<br>(A) any credit union or the Administration;
<br>
<br>(B) any director, officer, committee member, or employee of any credit union; or
<br>
<br>(C) any officer or employee of the Administration.
<br>(b) Enforcement
<br>
<br>Any employee or former employee who believes he has been discharged or discriminated against in violation of subsection (a) may file a civil action in the appropriate United States district court before the close of the 2-year period beginning on the date of such discharge or discrimination. The complainant shall also file a copy of the complaint initiating such action with the Board.
<br>(c) Remedies
<br>
<br>If the district court determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, it may order the credit union or the Administration which committed the violation—
<br>
<br>(1) to reinstate the employee to his former position,
<br>
<br>(2) to pay compensatory damages, or
<br>
<br>(3) take other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.
<br>(d) Limitations
<br>
<br>The protections of this section shall not apply to any employee who—
<br>
<br>(1) deliberately causes or participates in the alleged violation of law or regulation, or
<br>
<br>(2) knowingly or recklessly provides substantially false information to such an agency or the Attorney General.

<br>§1790c. Reward for information leading to recoveries or civil penalties
<br>
<br>The Board may pay rewards in connection with an offense affecting an insured credit union, under the same circumstances and subject to the same limitations that a Federal banking agency may pay rewards under section 1831j of this title in connection with an offense affecting a depository institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
<br>
<br>(June 26, 1934, ch. 750, title II, §214, as added Pub. L. 101–73, title IX, §933(b), Aug. 9, 1989, 103 Stat. 496.)
<br>§1790d. Prompt corrective action
<br>(a) Resolving problems to protect Fund
<br>(1) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.
<br>(2) Prompt corrective action required
<br>
<br>The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.
<br>(b) Regulations required
<br>(1) Insured credit unions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is—
<br>
<br>(i) consistent with this section; and
<br>
<br>(ii) comparable to section 1831o of this title.
<br>(B) Cooperative character of credit unions
<br>
<br>The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that—
<br>
<br>(i) do not issue capital stock;
<br>
<br>(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and
<br>
<br>(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.
<br>(2) New credit unions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).
<br>(B) Criteria for alternative system
<br>
<br>The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;
<br>
<br>(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;
<br>
<br>(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either—
<br>
<br>(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or
<br>
<br>(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;
<br>
<br>(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and
<br>
<br>(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.
<br>(c) Net worth categories
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
<br>(A) Well capitalized
<br>
<br>An insured credit union is "well capitalized" if—
<br>
<br>(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and
<br>
<br>(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).
<br>(B) Adequately capitalized
<br>
<br>An insured credit union is "adequately capitalized" if—
<br>
<br>(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and
<br>
<br>(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).
<br>(C) Undercapitalized
<br>
<br>An insured credit union is "undercapitalized" if—
<br>
<br>(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).
<br>(D) Significantly undercapitalized
<br>
<br>An insured credit union is "significantly undercapitalized"—
<br>
<br>(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if—
<br>
<br>(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and
<br>
<br>(II) it—
<br>
<br>(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or
<br>
<br>(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.
<br>(E) Critically undercapitalized
<br>
<br>An insured credit union is "critically undercapitalized" if it has a net worth ratio of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).
<br>(2) Adjusting net worth levels
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If, for purposes of section 1831o(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).
<br>(B) Determinations required
<br>
<br>The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board—
<br>
<br>(i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and
<br>
<br>(ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.
<br>(C) Transition period required
<br>
<br>If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.
<br>(d) Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) shall include a risk-based net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.
<br>(2) Standard
<br>
<br>The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.
<br>(e) Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized
<br>(1) In general
