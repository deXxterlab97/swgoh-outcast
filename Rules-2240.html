<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–248, title IX, §902, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1573, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) It is in the national interest to encourage the production of cost-effective, in-space transportation systems, which would be built and operated by the private sector on a commercial basis.
<br>
<br>"(2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end of their useful lives, and increase the capability and reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.
<br>
<br>"(3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance the economic well-being and national security of the United States by reducing space operations costs for commercial and national space programs and by adding new space capabilities to space operations.
<br>
<br>"(4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to geostationary and other high energy orbits.
<br>
<br>"(5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other planets.
<br>
<br>"(6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic loss to the United States and present substantial concerns for the current backlog of national space assets.
<br>
<br>"(7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can provide new options for alternative planning approaches and risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national space assets.
<br>
<br>"(8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems developed by the private sector can provide in-space transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need for the United States to bear the cost of production of such systems.
<br>
<br>"(9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which the United States can help qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing for the production of commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at the same time minimizing Government commitment and involvement in the development of such systems."
<br>§50302. Loan guarantees for production of commercial reusable in-space transportation

<br>
<br>(2) Periodic disbursements.—In the case of a loan guarantee in which proceeds of the loan are disbursed over time, the Secretary shall collect the amount required under this subsection on a pro rata basis, as determined by the Secretary, at the time of each disbursement.
<br>
<br>(e) Other Terms and Conditions.—
<br>
<br>(1) Prohibition on subordination.—A loan guaranteed under this section may not be subordinated to another debt contracted by the United States commercial provider concerned, or to any other claims against such provider.
<br>
<br>(2) Restriction on income.—A loan guaranteed under this section may not—
<br>
<br>(A) provide income which is excluded from gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.); or
<br>
<br>(B) provide significant collateral or security, as determined by the Secretary, for other obligations the income from which is so excluded.
<br>
<br>(3) Treatment of guarantee.—The guarantee of a loan under this section shall be conclusive evidence of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) That the guarantee has been properly obtained.
<br>
<br>(B) That the loan qualifies for the guarantee.
<br>
<br>(C) That, but for fraud or material misrepresentation by the holder of the loan, the guarantee is valid, legal, and enforceable.
<br>
<br>(4) Other terms and conditions.—The Secretary may establish any other terms and conditions for a guarantee of a loan under this section as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the financial interests of the United States.
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) Forbearance.—The Attorney General may, with the approval of the parties concerned, forbear from enforcing any right of the United States under a loan guaranteed under this section for the benefit of a United States commercial provider if such forbearance will not result in any cost, as defined in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a(5)), to the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) Utilization of property.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to the terms of a loan guaranteed under this section, upon the default of a United States commercial provider under the loan, the Secretary may, at the election of the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) assume control of the physical asset financed by the loan; and
<br>
<br>(B) complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, or sell the physical asset.
<br>
<br>(g) Credit Instruments.—
<br>
<br>(1) Authority to issue instruments.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, issue credit instruments to United States commercial providers of in-space transportation services or systems, with the aggregate cost (as determined under the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.)) of such instruments not to exceed $1,500,000,000, but only to the extent that new budget authority to cover such costs is provided in subsequent appropriations Acts or authority is otherwise provided in subsequent appropriations Acts.
<br>
<br>(2) Credit subsidy.—The Secretary shall provide a credit subsidy for any credit instrument issued under this subsection in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(3) Construction.—The eligibility of a United States commercial provider of in-space transportation services or systems for a credit instrument under this subsection is in addition to any eligibility of such provider for a loan guarantee under other provisions of this section.

<br>Pub. L. 102–588, title V, §501, Nov. 4, 1992, 106 Stat. 5122, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) commercial activities of the private sector have substantially contributed to the strength of both the United States space program and the national economy;
<br>
<br>"(2) a robust United States space transportation capability remains a vital cornerstone of the United States space program;
<br>
<br>"(3) the availability of commercial launch services is essential for the continued growth of the United States commercial space sector;
<br>
<br>"(4) a timely extension of the excess third party claims payment provisions of the Commercial Space Launch Act [now 51 U.S.C. 50901 et seq.] is appropriate and necessary to enable the private sector to continue covering maximum probable liability risks while protecting the private sector from uninsurable levels of liability which could hinder international competitiveness;
<br>
<br>"(5) a program to demonstrate how recipients of Federal grants can purchase launch services directly from the private sector has the potential to improve the capabilities of the United States commercial launch industry;
<br>
<br>"(6) improvements and additions to the Nation's space transportation infrastructure contribute to a robust and cost effective space transportation capability for both public sector and private sector users;
<br>
<br>"(7) private sector use of available Government facilities on a reimbursable basis contributes to a stronger commercial space sector;
<br>
<br>"(8) the Federal Government should purchase space goods and services which are commercially available, or could be made available commercially in response to a Government procurement request, whenever such goods or services meet Government mission requirements in a cost effective manner;
<br>
<br>"(9) it is appropriate for the Government to act as an anchor tenant for commercial space development projects which have a reasonable potential to develop non-Federal markets and which meet Federal needs in a cost effective manner; and
<br>
<br>"(10) the provision of compensation to commercial providers of space goods and services for termination of contracts at the convenience of the Government assists in enabling the private sector to invest in space activities which are initially dependent on Government purchases."

<br>§50901. Findings and purposes
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the peaceful uses of outer space continue to be of great value and to offer benefits to all mankind;
<br>
<br>(2) private applications of space technology have achieved a significant level of commercial and economic activity and offer the potential for growth in the future, particularly in the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) new and innovative equipment and services are being sought, produced, and offered by entrepreneurs in telecommunications, information services, microgravity research, human space flight, and remote sensing technologies;
<br>
<br>(4) the private sector in the United States has the capability of developing and providing private launching, reentry, and associated services that would complement the launching, reentry, and associated capabilities of the United States Government;
<br>
<br>(5) the development of commercial launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services would enable the United States to retain its competitive position internationally, contributing to the national interest and economic well-being of the United States;
<br>
<br>(6) providing launch services and reentry services by the private sector is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and would be facilitated by stable, minimal, and appropriate regulatory guidelines that are fairly and expeditiously applied;
<br>
<br>(7) the United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>(8) space transportation, including the establishment and operation of launch sites, reentry sites, and complementary facilities, the providing of launch services and reentry services, the establishment of support facilities, and the providing of support services, is an important element of the transportation system of the United States, and in connection with the commerce of the United States there is a need to develop a strong space transportation infrastructure with significant private sector involvement;
<br>
<br>(9) the participation of State governments in encouraging and facilitating private sector involvement in space-related activity, particularly through the establishment of a space transportation-related infrastructure, including launch sites, reentry sites, complementary facilities, and launch site and reentry site support facilities, is in the national interest and is of significant public benefit;
<br>
<br>(10) the goal of safely opening space to the American people and their private commercial, scientific, and cultural enterprises should guide Federal space investments, policies, and regulations;
<br>
<br>(11) private industry has begun to develop commercial launch vehicles capable of carrying human beings into space and greater private investment in these efforts will stimulate the Nation's commercial space transportation industry as a whole;
<br>
<br>(12) space transportation is inherently risky, and the future of the commercial human space flight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance;
<br>
<br>(13) a critical area of responsibility for the Department of Transportation is to regulate the operations and safety of the emerging commercial human space flight industry;
<br>
<br>(14) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal, regulatory, and safety regime for commercial human space flight; and
<br>
<br>(15) the regulatory standards governing human space flight must evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew, government astronauts, or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew, government astronauts, and space flight participants from the industry.
<br>
<br>(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to promote economic growth and entrepreneurial activity through use of the space environment for peaceful purposes;
<br>
<br>(2) to encourage the United States private sector to provide launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services by—
<br>
<br>(A) simplifying and expediting the issuance and transfer of commercial licenses;
<br>
<br>(B) facilitating and encouraging the use of Government-developed space technology; and
<br>
<br>(C) promoting the continuous improvement of the safety of launch vehicles designed to carry humans, including through the issuance of regulations, to the extent permitted by this chapter;
<br>
<br>(3) to provide that the Secretary of Transportation is to oversee and coordinate the conduct of commercial launch and reentry operations, issue permits and commercial licenses and transfer commercial licenses authorizing those operations, and protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(4) to facilitate the strengthening and expansion of the United States space transportation infrastructure, including the enhancement of United States launch sites and launch-site support facilities, and development of reentry sites, with Government, State, and private sector involvement, to support the full range of United States space-related activities.

If no license, authorization, or permit is required, the Secretary may prevent the launch or reentry if the Secretary decides the launch or reentry would jeopardize the public health and safety, safety of property, or national security or foreign policy interest of the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) Single License or Permit.—The Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that only 1 license or permit is required from the Department of Transportation to conduct activities involving crew, government astronauts, or space flight participants, including launch and reentry, for which a license or permit is required under this chapter. The Secretary shall ensure that all Department of Transportation regulations relevant to the licensed or permitted activity are satisfied.

<br>70104(a) 	49 App.:2605(a). 	Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. 98–575, §6(a), (b), 98 Stat. 3057.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(2)–(4), the cross-reference is to section 70102(1) of the revised title (restating 49 App.:2603(12)) rather than to section 70102(11) (restating 49 App.:2603(11)) to correct a mistake. Section 3(2) of the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100–657, 102 Stat. 3900) redesignated 49 App.:2603(11) as 49 App.:2603(12) but did not amend the cross-reference in 49 App.:2605(a).
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(3) and (4), the words "the government of" are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "in force" are omitted as surplus.
<br>

<br>
