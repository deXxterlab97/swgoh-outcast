<br>§1413. Local educational agency eligibility
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>A local educational agency is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if such agency submits a plan that provides assurances to the State educational agency that the local educational agency meets each of the following conditions:
<br>(1) Consistency with State policies
<br>
<br>The local educational agency, in providing for the education of children with disabilities within its jurisdiction, has in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established under section 1412 of this title.
<br>(2) Use of amounts
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Amounts provided to the local educational agency under this subchapter shall be expended in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subchapter and—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be used to supplement State, local, and other Federal funds and not to supplant such funds; and
<br>
<br>(iii) shall not be used, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), to reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the local educational agency from local funds below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to—
<br>
<br>(i) the voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or departure for just cause, of special education personnel;
<br>
<br>(ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child—
<br>
<br>(I) has left the jurisdiction of the agency;
<br>
<br>(II) has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide a free appropriate public education to the child has terminated; or
<br>
<br>(III) no longer needs such program of special education; or
<br>
<br>(iv) the termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.
<br>(C) Adjustment to local fiscal effort in certain fiscal years
<br>(i) Amounts in excess
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which the allocation received by a local educational agency under section 1411(f) of this title exceeds the amount the local educational agency received for the previous fiscal year, the local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures otherwise required by subparagraph (A)(iii) by not more than 50 percent of the amount of such excess.
<br>(ii) Use of amounts to carry out activities under ESEA
<br>
<br>If a local educational agency exercises the authority under clause (i), the agency shall use an amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures under clause (i) to carry out activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.].
<br>(iii) State prohibition
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (i), if a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is unable to establish and maintain programs of free appropriate public education that meet the requirements of subsection (a) or the State educational agency has taken action against the local educational agency under section 1416 of this title, the State educational agency shall prohibit the local educational agency from reducing the level of expenditures under clause (i) for that fiscal year.
<br>(iv) Special rule
<br>
<br>The amount of funds expended by a local educational agency under subsection (f) shall count toward the maximum amount of expenditures such local educational agency may reduce under clause (i).
<br>(D) Schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) or any other provision of this subchapter, a local educational agency may use funds received under this subchapter for any fiscal year to carry out a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6314], except that the amount so used in any such program shall not exceed—
<br>
<br>(i) the number of children with disabilities participating in the schoolwide program; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) the amount received by the local educational agency under this subchapter for that fiscal year; divided by
<br>
<br>(II) the number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of that agency.
<br>(3) Personnel development
<br>
<br>The local educational agency shall ensure that all personnel necessary to carry out this subchapter are appropriately and adequately prepared, subject to the requirements of section 1412(a)(14) of this title and section 2102(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6612(b)].
<br>(4) Permissive use of funds
<br>(A) Uses
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(A) or section 1412(a)(17)(B) of this title (relating to commingled funds), funds provided to the local educational agency under this subchapter may be used for the following activities:
<br>(i) Services and aids that also benefit nondisabled children
<br>
<br>For the costs of special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services, provided in a regular class or other education-related setting to a child with a disability in accordance with the individualized education program of the child, even if 1 or more nondisabled children benefit from such services.
<br>(ii) Early intervening services
<br>
<br>To develop and implement coordinated, early intervening educational services in accordance with subsection (f).
<br>(iii) High cost education and related services
<br>
<br>To establish and implement cost or risk sharing funds, consortia, or cooperatives for the local educational agency itself, or for local educational agencies working in a consortium of which the local educational agency is a part, to pay for high cost special education and related services.
<br>(B) Administrative case management
<br>
<br>A local educational agency may use funds received under this subchapter to purchase appropriate technology for recordkeeping, data collection, and related case management activities of teachers and related services personnel providing services described in the individualized education program of children with disabilities, that is needed for the implementation of such case management activities.
<br>(5) Treatment of charter schools and their students
<br>
<br>In carrying out this subchapter with respect to charter schools that are public schools of the local educational agency, the local educational agency—
<br>
<br>(A) serves children with disabilities attending those charter schools in the same manner as the local educational agency serves children with disabilities in its other schools, including providing supplementary and related services on site at the charter school to the same extent to which the local educational agency has a policy or practice of providing such services on the site to its other public schools; and
<br>
<br>(B) provides funds under this subchapter to those charter schools—
<br>
<br>(i) on the same basis as the local educational agency provides funds to the local educational agency's other public schools, including proportional distribution based on relative enrollment of children with disabilities; and
<br>
<br>(ii) at the same time as the agency distributes other Federal funds to the agency's other public schools, consistent with the State's charter school law.
<br>(6) Purchase of instructional materials
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after December 3, 2004, a local educational agency that chooses to coordinate with the National Instructional Materials Access Center, when purchasing print instructional materials, shall acquire the print instructional materials in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as a State educational agency acquires print instructional materials under section 1412(a)(23) of this title.
<br>(B) Rights of local educational agency
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a local educational agency to coordinate with the National Instructional Materials Access Center.

<br>(b) Exception for prior local plans
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a local educational agency or State agency has on file with the State educational agency policies and procedures that demonstrate that such local educational agency, or such State agency, as the case may be, meets any requirement of subsection (a), including any policies and procedures filed under this subchapter as in effect before the effective date of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the State educational agency shall consider such local educational agency or State agency, as the case may be, to have met such requirement for purposes of receiving assistance under this subchapter.
<br>(2) Modification made by local educational agency
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (3), an application submitted by a local educational agency in accordance with this section shall remain in effect until the local educational agency submits to the State educational agency such modifications as the local educational agency determines necessary.
<br>(3) Modifications required by State educational agency

<br>If, after the effective date of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the provisions of this chapter are amended (or the regulations developed to carry out this chapter are amended), there is a new interpretation of this chapter by Federal or State courts, or there is an official finding of noncompliance with Federal or State law or regulations, then the State educational agency may require a local educational agency to modify its application only to the extent necessary to ensure the local educational agency's compliance with this subchapter or State law.
<br>(c) Notification of local educational agency or State agency in case of ineligibility
<br>
<br>If the State educational agency determines that a local educational agency or State agency is not eligible under this section, then the State educational agency shall notify the local educational agency or State agency, as the case may be, of that determination and shall provide such local educational agency or State agency with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

<br>(2) Additional requirement
<br>
<br>Any State agency or local educational agency in receipt of a notice described in paragraph (1) shall, by means of public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency.
<br>(3) Consideration
<br>
<br>In carrying out its responsibilities under paragraph (1), the State educational agency shall consider any decision made in a hearing held under section 1415 of this title that is adverse to the local educational agency or State agency involved in that decision.

<br>(1) Joint establishment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A State educational agency may require a local educational agency to establish its eligibility jointly with another local educational agency if the State educational agency determines that the local educational agency will be ineligible under this section because the local educational agency will not be able to establish and maintain programs of sufficient size and scope to effectively meet the needs of children with disabilities.
<br>(B) Charter school exception
<br>
<br>A State educational agency may not require a charter school that is a local educational agency to jointly establish its eligibility under subparagraph (A) unless the charter school is explicitly permitted to do so under the State's charter school law.
<br>(2) Amount of payments
<br>
<br>If a State educational agency requires the joint establishment of eligibility under paragraph (1), the total amount of funds made available to the affected local educational agencies shall be equal to the sum of the payments that each such local educational agency would have received under section 1411(f) of this title if such agencies were eligible for such payments.

<br>A local educational agency may not use more than 15 percent of the amount such agency receives under this subchapter for any fiscal year, less any amount reduced by the agency pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(C), if any, in combination with other amounts (which may include amounts other than education funds), to develop and implement coordinated, early intervening services, which may include interagency financing structures, for students in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on students in kindergarten through grade 3) who have not been identified as needing special education or related services but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment.
<br>(2) Activities
<br>
<br>In implementing coordinated, early intervening services under this subsection, a local educational agency may carry out activities that include—
<br>
<br>(A) professional development (which may be provided by entities other than local educational agencies) for teachers and other school staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic instruction and behavioral interventions, including scientifically based literacy instruction, and, where appropriate, instruction on the use of adaptive and instructional software; and
<br>
<br>(B) providing educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports, including scientifically based literacy instruction.
<br>(3) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or create a right to a free appropriate public education under this subchapter.
<br>(4) Reporting
<br>
<br>Each local educational agency that develops and maintains coordinated, early intervening services under this subsection shall annually report to the State educational agency on—
<br>
<br>(A) the number of students served under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) the number of students served under this subsection who subsequently receive special education and related services under this chapter during the preceding 2-year period.
<br>(5) Coordination with Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
<br>
<br>Funds made available to carry out this subsection may be used to carry out coordinated, early intervening services aligned with activities funded by, and carried out under, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] if such funds are used to supplement, and not supplant, funds made available under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for the activities and services assisted under this subsection.
<br>(g) Direct services by the State educational agency
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A State educational agency shall use the payments that would otherwise have been available to a local educational agency or to a State agency to provide special education and related services directly to children with disabilities residing in the area served by that local educational agency, or for whom that State agency is responsible, if the State educational agency determines that the local educational agency or State agency, as the case may be—
<br>
<br>(A) has not provided the information needed to establish the eligibility of such local educational agency or State agency under this section;
<br>
<br>(B) is unable to establish and maintain programs of free appropriate public education that meet the requirements of subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(C) is unable or unwilling to be consolidated with 1 or more local educational agencies in order to establish and maintain such programs; or
<br>
<br>(D) has 1 or more children with disabilities who can best be served by a regional or State program or service delivery system designed to meet the needs of such children.
<br>(2) Manner and location of education and services
<br>
<br>The State educational agency may provide special education and related services under paragraph (1) in such manner and at such locations (including regional or State centers) as the State educational agency considers appropriate. Such education and services shall be provided in accordance with this subchapter.
<br>(h) State agency eligibility
<br>
<br>Any State agency that desires to receive a subgrant for any fiscal year under section 1411(f) of this title shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the State educational agency that—
<br>
<br>(1) all children with disabilities who are participating in programs and projects funded under this subchapter receive a free appropriate public education, and that those children and their parents are provided all the rights and procedural safeguards described in this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) the agency meets such other conditions of this section as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
<br>(i) Disciplinary information
<br>
<br>The State may require that a local educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same extent that such disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children. The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child. If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from 1 school to another, the transmission of any of the child's records shall include both the child's current individualized education program and any such statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child.
<br>(j) State agency flexibility
<br>(1) Adjustment to State fiscal effort in certain fiscal years
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year for which the allotment received by a State under section 1411 of this title exceeds the amount the State received for the previous fiscal year and if the State in school year 2003–2004 or any subsequent school year pays or reimburses all local educational agencies within the State from State revenue 100 percent of the non-Federal share of the costs of special education and related services, the State educational agency, notwithstanding paragraphs (17) and (18) of section 1412(a) of this title and section 1412(b) of this title, may reduce the level of expenditures from State sources for the education of children with disabilities by not more than 50 percent of the amount of such excess.
<br>(2) Prohibition
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the Secretary determines that a State educational agency is unable to establish, maintain, or oversee programs of free appropriate public education that meet the requirements of this subchapter, or that the State needs assistance, intervention, or substantial intervention under section 1416(d)(2)(A) of this title, the Secretary shall prohibit the State educational agency from exercising the authority in paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Education activities
<br>
<br>If a State educational agency exercises the authority under paragraph (1), the agency shall use funds from State sources, in an amount equal to the amount of the reduction under paragraph (1), to support activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] or to support need based student or teacher higher education programs.
<br>(4) Report
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year for which a State educational agency exercises the authority under paragraph (1), the State educational agency shall report to the Secretary the amount of expenditures reduced pursuant to such paragraph and the activities that were funded pursuant to paragraph (3).
<br>(5) Limitation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State educational agency may not reduce the level of expenditures described in paragraph (1) if any local educational agency in the State would, as a result of such reduction, receive less than 100 percent of the amount necessary to ensure that all children with disabilities served by the local educational agency receive a free appropriate public education from the combination of Federal funds received under this chapter and State funds received from the State educational agency.

<br>§1414. Evaluations, eligibility determinations, individualized education programs, and educational placements
<br>(a) Evaluations, parental consent, and reevaluations
<br>(1) Initial evaluations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A State educational agency, other State agency, or local educational agency shall conduct a full and individual initial evaluation in accordance with this paragraph and subsection (b), before the initial provision of special education and related services to a child with a disability under this subchapter.
<br>(B) Request for initial evaluation
<br>
<br>Consistent with subparagraph (D), either a parent of a child, or a State educational agency, other State agency, or local educational agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability.
<br>(C) Procedures
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures—
<br>
<br>(I) to determine whether a child is a child with a disability (as defined in 1401 of this title) within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or, if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within such timeframe; and
<br>
<br>(II) to determine the educational needs of such child.
<br>(ii) Exception
<br>
<br>The relevant timeframe in clause (i)(I) shall not apply to a local educational agency if—
<br>
<br>(I) a child enrolls in a school served by the local educational agency after the relevant timeframe in clause (i)(I) has begun and prior to a determination by the child's previous local educational agency as to whether the child is a child with a disability (as defined in section 1401 of this title), but only if the subsequent local educational agency is making sufficient progress to ensure a prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and subsequent local educational agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed; or
<br>
<br>(II) the parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the child for the evaluation.
<br>(D) Parental consent
<br>(i) In general
<br>(I) Consent for initial evaluation
<br>
<br>The agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if the child qualifies as a child with a disability as defined in section 1401 of this title shall obtain informed consent from the parent of such child before conducting the evaluation. Parental consent for evaluation shall not be construed as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services.
<br>(II) Consent for services
<br>
<br>An agency that is responsible for making a free appropriate public education available to a child with a disability under this subchapter shall seek to obtain informed consent from the parent of such child before providing special education and related services to the child.
<br>(ii) Absence of consent
<br>(I) For initial evaluation
<br>
<br>If the parent of such child does not provide consent for an initial evaluation under clause (i)(I), or the parent fails to respond to a request to provide the consent, the local educational agency may pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedures described in section 1415 of this title, except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such parental consent.
<br>(II) For services
<br>
<br>If the parent of such child refuses to consent to services under clause (i)(II), the local educational agency shall not provide special education and related services to the child by utilizing the procedures described in section 1415 of this title.
<br>(III) Effect on agency obligations
<br>
<br>If the parent of such child refuses to consent to the receipt of special education and related services, or the parent fails to respond to a request to provide such consent—
<br>
<br>(aa) the local educational agency shall not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make available a free appropriate public education to the child for the failure to provide such child with the special education and related services for which the local educational agency requests such consent; and
<br>
<br>(bb) the local educational agency shall not be required to convene an IEP meeting or develop an IEP under this section for the child for the special education and related services for which the local educational agency requests such consent.
<br>(iii) Consent for wards of the State
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>If the child is a ward of the State and is not residing with the child's parent, the agency shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent from the parent (as defined in section 1401 of this title) of the child for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.
<br>(II) Exception
<br>
<br>The agency shall not be required to obtain informed consent from the parent of a child for an initial evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability if—
<br>
<br>(aa) despite reasonable efforts to do so, the agency cannot discover the whereabouts of the parent of the child;
<br>
<br>(bb) the rights of the parents of the child have been terminated in accordance with State law; or
<br>
<br>(cc) the rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the child.
<br>(E) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>The screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum implementation shall not be considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special education and related services.
<br>(2) Reevaluations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A local educational agency shall ensure that a reevaluation of each child with a disability is conducted in accordance with subsections (b) and (c)—
<br>
<br>(i) if the local educational agency determines that the educational or related services needs, including improved academic achievement and functional performance, of the child warrant a reevaluation; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the child's parents or teacher requests a reevaluation.
<br>(B) Limitation
<br>
<br>A reevaluation conducted under subparagraph (A) shall occur—
<br>
<br>(i) not more frequently than once a year, unless the parent and the local educational agency agree otherwise; and
<br>
<br>(ii) at least once every 3 years, unless the parent and the local educational agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.
<br>(b) Evaluation procedures
<br>(1) Notice
<br>
<br>The local educational agency shall provide notice to the parents of a child with a disability, in accordance with subsections (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) of section 1415 of this title, that describes any evaluation procedures such agency proposes to conduct.
<br>(2) Conduct of evaluation
<br>
<br>In conducting the evaluation, the local educational agency shall—
<br>
<br>(A) use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining—
<br>
<br>(i) whether the child is a child with a disability; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the content of the child's individualized education program, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum, or, for preschool children, to participate in appropriate activities;
<br>
<br>(B) not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and
<br>
<br>(C) use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors.
<br>(3) Additional requirements
<br>
<br>Each local educational agency shall ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under this section—
<br>
<br>(i) are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis;
<br>
<br>(ii) are provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally, unless it is not feasible to so provide or administer;
<br>
<br>(iii) are used for purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable;
<br>
<br>(iv) are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and
<br>
<br>(v) are administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of such assessments;
<br>
<br>(B) the child is assessed in all areas of suspected disability;
<br>
<br>(C) assessment tools and strategies that provide relevant information that directly assists persons in determining the educational needs of the child are provided; and
<br>
<br>(D) assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from 1 school district to another school district in the same academic year are coordinated with such children's prior and subsequent schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as possible, to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations.
<br>(4) Determination of eligibility and educational need
<br>
<br>Upon completion of the administration of assessments and other evaluation measures—
<br>
<br>(A) the determination of whether the child is a child with a disability as defined in section 1401(3) of this title and the educational needs of the child shall be made by a team of qualified professionals and the parent of the child in accordance with paragraph (5); and
<br>
<br>(B) a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility shall be given to the parent.
<br>(5) Special rule for eligibility determination
<br>
<br>In making a determination of eligibility under paragraph (4)(A), a child shall not be determined to be a child with a disability if the determinant factor for such determination is—
<br>
<br>(A) lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including in the essential components of reading instruction (as defined in section 6368(3) of this title, as such section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015);
<br>
<br>(B) lack of instruction in math; or
<br>
<br>(C) limited English proficiency.
<br>(6) Specific learning disabilities
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1406(b) of this title, when determining whether a child has a specific learning disability as defined in section 1401 of this title, a local educational agency shall not be required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability in oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skill, reading comprehension, mathematical calculation, or mathematical reasoning.
<br>(B) Additional authority
<br>
<br>In determining whether a child has a specific learning disability, a local educational agency may use a process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention as a part of the evaluation procedures described in paragraphs (2) and (3).
<br>(c) Additional requirements for evaluation and reevaluations
<br>(1) Review of existing evaluation data
<br>
<br>As part of an initial evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this section, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) review existing evaluation data on the child, including—
<br>
<br>(i) evaluations and information provided by the parents of the child;
<br>
<br>(ii) current classroom-based, local, or State assessments, and classroom-based observations; and
<br>
<br>(iii) observations by teachers and related services providers; and
<br>
<br>(B) on the basis of that review, and input from the child's parents, identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine—
<br>
<br>(i) whether the child is a child with a disability as defined in section 1401(3) of this title, and the educational needs of the child, or, in case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues to have such a disability and such educational needs;
<br>
<br>(ii) the present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the child;
<br>
<br>(iii) whether the child needs special education and related services, or in the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues to need special education and related services; and
<br>
<br>(iv) whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the individualized education program of the child and to participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum.
<br>(2) Source of data
<br>
<br>The local educational agency shall administer such assessments and other evaluation measures as may be needed to produce the data identified by the IEP Team under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>(3) Parental consent
<br>
<br>Each local educational agency shall obtain informed parental consent, in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(D), prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a disability, except that such informed parental consent need not be obtained if the local educational agency can demonstrate that it had taken reasonable measures to obtain such consent and the child's parent has failed to respond.
<br>(4) Requirements if additional data are not needed
<br>
<br>If the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, determine that no additional data are needed to determine whether the child continues to be a child with a disability and to determine the child's educational needs, the local educational agency—
<br>
<br>(A) shall notify the child's parents of—
<br>
<br>(i) that determination and the reasons for the determination; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the right of such parents to request an assessment to determine whether the child continues to be a child with a disability and to determine the child's educational needs; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall not be required to conduct such an assessment unless requested to by the child's parents.
<br>(5) Evaluations before change in eligibility
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a local educational agency shall evaluate a child with a disability in accordance with this section before determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The evaluation described in subparagraph (A) shall not be required before the termination of a child's eligibility under this subchapter due to graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility for a free appropriate public education under State law.
<br>(ii) Summary of performance
<br>
<br>For a child whose eligibility under this subchapter terminates under circumstances described in clause (i), a local educational agency shall provide the child with a summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance, which shall include recommendations on how to assist the child in meeting the child's postsecondary goals.
