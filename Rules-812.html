<br>
<br>(B) intentionally places a person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to that person, a member of the immediate family (as defined in section 115) of that person, or a spouse or intimate partner of that person by a course of conduct involving threats, acts of vandalism, property damage, criminal trespass, harassment, or intimidation; or

<br>
<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Severability
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–294, §3(c), Dec. 9, 2010, 124 Stat. 3179, provided that: "If any provision of section 48 of title 18, United States Code (as amended by this section), or the application of the provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the provision and the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby."
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–294, §2, Dec. 9, 2010, 124 Stat. 3177, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The United States has a long history of prohibiting the interstate sale, marketing, advertising, exchange, and distribution of obscene material and speech that is integral to criminal conduct.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Federal Government and the States have a compelling interest in preventing intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty.
<br>
<br>"(3) Each of the several States and the District of Columbia criminalize intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty, such as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, or impaling of animals for no socially redeeming purpose.
<br>
<br>"(4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes are commonly referred to as 'animal crush videos'.
<br>
<br>"(5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a whole—
<br>
<br>"(A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex;
<br>
<br>"(B) are patently offensive; and
<br>
<br>"(C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
<br>
<br>"(7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.
<br>
<br>"(8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the animal crush video image.
<br>
<br>"(9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine manner that—
<br>
<br>"(A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain anonymous;
<br>
<br>"(B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty occurred; and
<br>
<br>"(C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred within the statute of limitations.
<br>
<br>"(10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such behavior."
<br>§49. Enforcement of animal fighting prohibitions
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—Whoever violates subsection (a)(1), (b), (c), or (d) of section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both, for each violation.
<br>
<br>(b) Attending an Animal Fighting Venture.—Whoever violates subsection (a)(2)(A) of section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2156) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both, for each violation.
<br>
<br>(c) Causing an Individual Who Has Not Attained the Age of 16 To Attend an Animal Fighting Venture.—Whoever violates subsection (a)(2)(B) of section 26 (7 U.S.C. 2156) of the Animal Welfare Act shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both, for each violation.
<br>

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 688; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), (K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147; Pub. L. 104–132, title VII, §708(b), Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1296; Pub. L. 107–56, title VIII, §§810(a), 811(a), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 380, 381.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§464, 465 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§285, 286, 35 Stat. 1144).
<br>
<br>Sections were consolidated and rewritten both as to form and substance and that part of each section relating to destruction of property by means other than burning constitutes section 1363 of this title.
<br>
<br>The words "within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" were added to preserve existing limitations of territorial applicability. (See section 7 of this title and note thereunder.)
<br>
<br>The phrase "any building, structure, or vessel, any machinery or building materials and supplies, military or naval stores, munitions of war or any structural aids or appliances for navigation or shipping" was substituted for "any dwelling house, or any store, barn, stable, or other building, parcel of a dwelling house", in section 464 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and "any arsenal, armory, magazine, rope walk, ship house, warehouse, blockhouse, or barrack, or any storehouse, barn or stable, not parcel of a dwelling house, or any other building not mentioned in the section last preceding, or any vessel, built, building, or undergoing repair, or any lighthouse, or beacon, or any machinery, timber, cables, rigging, or other materials or appliances for building, repairing or fitting out vessels, or any pile of wood, boards, or other lumber, or any military, naval or victualing stores, arms, or other munitions of war", in section 465 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The substituted phrase is a concise and comprehensive description of the things enumerated in both sections.
<br>
<br>The punishment provisions are new and are graduated with some regard to the gravity of the offense. It was felt that a possible punishment of 20 years for burning a wood pile or injuring or destroying an outbuilding was disproportionate and not in harmony with recent legislation.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§118, 254 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §62, 35 Stat. 1100; May 18, 1934, ch. 299, §2, 48 Stat. 781).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates sections 118 and 254 with changes in phraseology and substance necessary to effect the consolidation.
<br>
<br>Also the words "Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture" appearing in section 118 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inserted in enumeration of Federal officers and employees in section 1114 of this title.
<br>
<br>The punishment provision of section 254 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was adopted as the latest expression of Congressional intent. This consolidation eliminates a serious incongruity in punishment and application.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 255 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (R.S. §4062).
<br>
<br>Punishment provision was rewritten to make it more definite by substituting a maximum of $5,000 in lieu of the words "fined at the discretion of the court." As thus revised this provision conforms with the first punishment provision of section 111 of this title. So, also, the greater punishment provided by the second paragraph of section 111 was added to this section for offenses involving the use of dangerous weapons.

<br>Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title VI, §645(c), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–709, provided that: "The amendments made by subsection (b) [enacting this section] shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996]."
<br>Congressional Findings and Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–309, §2, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4922, provided that:
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Female genital mutilation is recognized internationally as a human rights violation and a form of child abuse, gender discrimination, and violence against women and girls. Female genital mutilation is a global problem whose eradication requires international cooperation and enforcement at the national level. The United States should demonstrate its commitment to the rights of women and girls by leading the way in the international community in banning this abhorrent practice.
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress has previously prohibited the commission of female genital mutilation on minors. Female genital mutilation is a heinous practice that often inflicts excruciating pain on its victims and causes them to suffer grave physical and psychological harm.
<br>
<br>"(3) Congress has the power under article I, section 8 of the Constitution to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution treaties entered into by the United States.
<br>
<br>"(4) Congress also has the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit female genital mutilation. An international market for the practice exists, and persons who perform female genital mutilation in other countries typically earn a living from doing so.
<br>
<br>"(5) Those who perform this conduct often rely on a connection to interstate or foreign commerce, such as interstate or foreign travel, the transmission or receipt of communications in interstate or foreign commerce, the use of instruments traded in interstate or foreign commerce, or payments of any kind in furtherance of this conduct.
<br>
<br>"(6) Amending the statute to specify a link to interstate or foreign commerce would confirm that Congress has the affirmative power to prohibit this conduct."
<br>Sense of the Congress
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–309, §5, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4924, provided that: "It is the sense of the Congress that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan erred in invalidating the prior version of such section 116 [this section] (See United States v. Nagarwala, 350 F. Supp. 3d 613, 631 (E.D. Mich. 2018)). The commercial nature of female genital mutilation (hereinafter in this section referred to as 'FGM') is 'self-evident,' meaning that the 'absence of particularized findings' about the commercial nature of FGM in the predecessor statute did not 'call into question Congress's authority to legislate' (Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 21 (2005)). Nevertheless, the Congress has elected to amend the FGM statute to clarify the commercial nature of the conduct that this statute regulates. But, by doing so, Congress does not hereby ratify the district court's erroneous interpretation in Nagarwala."
<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title VI, §645(a), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–708, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the practice of female genital mutilation is carried out by members of certain cultural and religious groups within the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) the practice of female genital mutilation often results in the occurrence of physical and psychological health effects that harm the women involved;
<br>
<br>"(3) such mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights secured by Federal and State law, both statutory and constitutional;
<br>
<br>"(4) the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of female genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any single State or local jurisdiction to control;
<br>
