In carrying out this section, such Federal agency or agencies may not consider visual or auditory material to fail to qualify as being of international educational character—
<br>
<br>(1) because it advocates a particular position or viewpoint, whether or not it presents or acknowledges opposing viewpoints;
<br>
<br>(2) because it might lend itself to misinterpretation, or to misrepresentation of the United States or other countries, or their people or institutions;
<br>
<br>(3) because it is not representative, authentic, or accurate or does not represent the current state of factual knowledge of a subject or aspect of a subject unless the material contains widespread and gross misstatements of fact;
<br>
<br>(4) because it does not augment international understanding and goodwill, unless its primary purpose or effect is not to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or an aspect of a subject and its content is not such as to maintain, increase, or diffuse knowledge; or
<br>
<br>(5) because in the opinion of the agency the material is propaganda.
