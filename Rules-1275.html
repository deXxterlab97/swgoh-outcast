<br>
<br>"(1) the Secretary [of Transportation] and other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process should cooperate with each other and other agencies on environmental review and project delivery activities at the earliest practicable time to avoid delays and duplication of effort later in the process, head off potential conflicts, and ensure that planning and project development decisions reflect environmental values; and

<br>
<br>"(b) Technical Assistance.—If requested at any time by a State or local planning agency, the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, shall, to the extent practicable and appropriate, as determined by the agencies, provide technical assistance to the State or local planning agency on accomplishing the early coordination activities described in subsection (d).

<br>
<br>"(d) Early Coordination Activities.—Early coordination activities shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Technical assistance on identifying potential impacts and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.
<br>
<br>"(2) The potential appropriateness of using planning products and decisions in later environmental reviews.
<br>
<br>"(3) The identification and elimination from detailed study in the environmental review process of the issues that are not significant or that have been covered by prior environmental reviews.
<br>
<br>"(4) The identification of other environmental review and consultation requirements so that the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare, as appropriate, other required analyses and studies concurrently with planning activities.
<br>
<br>"(5) The identification by agencies with jurisdiction over any permits related to the project of any and all relevant information that will reasonably be required for the project.
<br>
<br>"(6) The reduction of duplication between requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and State and local planning and environmental review requirements, unless the agencies are specifically barred from doing so by applicable law.

<br>§140. Nondiscrimination
<br>
<br>(a) Prior to approving any programs for projects as provided for in section 135, the Secretary shall require assurances from any State desiring to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter that employment in connection with proposed projects will be provided without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, or sex. The Secretary shall require that each State shall include in the advertised specifications, notification of the specific equal employment opportunity responsibilities of the successful bidder. In approving programs for projects on any of the Federal-aid systems, the Secretary 1 if necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity, shall require certification by any State desiring to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter that there are in existence and available on a regional, statewide, or local basis, apprenticeship, skill improvement or other upgrading programs, registered with the Department of Labor or the appropriate State agency, if any, which provide equal opportunity for training and employment without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, or sex. In implementing such programs, a State may reserve training positions for persons who receive welfare assistance from such State; except that the implementation of any such program shall not cause current employees to be displaced or current positions to be supplanted or preclude workers that are participating in an apprenticeship, skill improvement, or other upgrading program registered with the Department of Labor or the appropriate State agency from being referred to, or hired on, projects funded under this title without regard to the length of time of their participation in such program. The Secretary shall periodically obtain from the Secretary of Labor and the respective State transportation departments information which will enable the Secretary to judge compliance with the requirements of this section and the Secretary of Labor shall render to the Secretary such assistance and information as the Secretary of Transportation shall deem necessary to carry out the equal employment opportunity program required hereunder.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary, in cooperation with any other department or agency of the Government, State agency, authority, association, institution, Indian tribal government, corporation (profit or nonprofit), or any other organization or person, is authorized to develop, conduct, and administer surface transportation and technology training, including skill improvement programs, and to develop and fund summer transportation institutes. From administrative funds made available under section 104(a), the Secretary shall deduct such sums as necessary, not to exceed $10,000,000 per fiscal year, for the administration of this subsection. Such sums so deducted shall remain available until expended. The provisions of section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41 shall not be applicable to contracts and agreements made under the authority herein granted to the Secretary. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not to exceed ½ of 1 percent of funds apportioned to a State for the surface transportation block grant program under section 104(b) may be available to carry out this subsection upon request of the State transportation department to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary, in cooperation with any other department or agency of the Government, State agency, authority, association, institution, Indian tribal government, corporation (profit or nonprofit), or any other organization or person, is authorized to develop, conduct, and administer training programs and assistance programs in connection with any program under this title in order that minority businesses may achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for contracts and subcontracts. From administrative funds made available under section 104(a), the Secretary shall deduct such sums as necessary, not to exceed $10,000,000 per fiscal year, for the administration of this subsection. The provisions of section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41 shall not be applicable to contracts and agreements made under the authority herein granted to the Secretary notwithstanding the provisions of section 3106 of title 41.
<br>
<br>(d) Indian Employment.—Consistent with section 703(i) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e–2(i)), nothing in this section shall preclude the preferential employment of Indians living on or near a reservation on projects and contracts on Indian reservation roads. States may implement a preference for employment of Indians on projects carried out under this title near Indian reservations. The Secretary shall cooperate with Indian tribal governments and the States to implement this subsection.

If the Secretary does not make such a determination within such one-year period, the amounts so withheld shall be reapportioned to all other eligible States.

<br>§144. National bridge and tunnel inventory and inspection standards
<br>
<br>(a) Findings and Declarations.—
<br>
<br>(1) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) the condition of the bridges of the United States has improved since the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105–178; 112 Stat. 107), yet continued improvement to bridge conditions is essential to protect the safety of the traveling public and allow for the efficient movement of people and goods on which the economy of the United States relies; and
<br>
<br>(B) the systematic preventative maintenance of bridges, and replacement and rehabilitation of deficient bridges, should be undertaken through an overall asset management approach to transportation investment.
<br>
<br>(2) Declarations.—Congress declares that it is in the vital interest of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) to inventory, inspect, and improve the condition of the highway bridges and tunnels of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) to use a data-driven, risk-based approach and cost-effective strategy for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation of highway bridges and tunnels to ensure safety and extended service life;
<br>
<br>(C) to use performance-based bridge management systems to assist States in making timely investments;
<br>
<br>(D) to ensure accountability and link performance outcomes to investment decisions; and
<br>
<br>(E) to ensure connectivity and access for residents of rural areas of the United States through strategic investments in National Highway System bridges and bridges on all public roads.
<br>
<br>(b) National Bridge and Tunnel Inventories.—The Secretary, in consultation with the States and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over highway bridges and tunnels, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) inventory all highway bridges on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned bridges, that are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads;
<br>
<br>(2) inventory all tunnels on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned tunnels;
<br>
<br>(3) classify the bridges according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, including the potential impacts to emergency evacuation routes and to regional and national freight and passenger mobility if the serviceability of the bridge is restricted or diminished;
<br>
<br>(4) based on that classification, assign each a risk-based priority for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation; and
<br>
<br>(5) determine the cost of replacing each structurally deficient bridge identified under this subsection with a comparable facility or the cost of rehabilitating the bridge.
<br>
<br>(c) General Bridge Authority.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525 et seq.) shall apply to bridges authorized to be replaced, in whole or in part, by this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Exception.—Section 502(b) of the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525(b)) and section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401), shall not apply to any bridge constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or replaced with assistance under this title, if the bridge is over waters that—
<br>
<br>(A) are not used and are not susceptible to use in the natural condition of the water or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce; and
<br>
<br>(B) are—

<br>
<br>(2) Inspection report.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the MAP–21, each State and appropriate Federal agency shall report element level data to the Secretary, as each bridge is inspected pursuant to this section, for all highway bridges on the National Highway System.
<br>
<br>(3) Guidance.—The Secretary shall provide guidance to States and Federal agencies for implementation of this subsection, while respecting the existing inspection schedule of each State.
<br>
<br>(4) Bridges not on national highway system.—The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) conduct a study on the benefits, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of requiring element-level data collection for bridges not on the National Highway System; and

<br>
<br>(e) Bridges Without Taxing Powers.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any bridge that is owned and operated by an agency that does not have taxing powers and whose functions include operating a federally assisted public transit system subsidized by toll revenues shall be eligible for assistance under this title, but the amount of such assistance shall in no event exceed the cumulative amount which such agency has expended for capital and operating costs to subsidize such transit system.
<br>
<br>(2) Insufficient assets.—Before authorizing an expenditure of funds under this subsection, the Secretary shall determine that the applicant agency has insufficient reserves, surpluses, and projected revenues (over and above those required for bridge and transit capital and operating costs) to fund the bridge project or activity eligible for assistance under this title.
<br>
<br>(3) Crediting of non-federal funds.—Any non-Federal funds expended for the seismic retrofit of the bridge may be credited toward the non-Federal share required as a condition of receipt of any Federal funds for seismic retrofit of the bridge made available after the date of the expenditure.
<br>
<br>(f) Replacement of Destroyed Bridges and Ferry Boat Service.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may use the funds apportioned under section 104(b)(2) to construct any bridge that replaces—
