<br>In subsection (a), the words "When an employee has been in a missing status almost 12 months" are substituted for "When the twelve months' period from the date of commencement of absence is about to expire in any case of a person entitled under section 2 of this Act to receive or be credited with pay and allowances" for clarity and to conform to the definitions in section 5561(2) and (5). For the same reasons, the words "the end of 12 months in a missing status" are substituted for "the twelve months' absence shall have expired". The words "or his designee" are supplied on authority of 50A U.S.C. 1009(a) which is codified in part in section 5566(a).

The words "or his designee" are supplied on authority of 50A U.S.C. 1009(a) which is in part codified in section 5566(a).

The words "This section does not entitle" are substituted for "Provided, That nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring . . . any right".
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
<br>§5566. Agency determinations
<br>
<br>(a) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may make any determination necessary to administer this subchapter, and when so made it is conclusive as to—
<br>
<br>(1) death or finding of death;
<br>
<br>(2) the fact of dependency under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(3) any other status covered by this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(4) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the head of the agency concerned; and
<br>
<br>(5) whether information received concerning an employee is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.
<br>
<br>(b) When the head of the agency concerned receives information that he considers to conclusively establish the death of an employee, he shall take action thereon as an official report of death, notwithstanding an earlier action relating to death or other status of the employee. After the end of 12 months in a missing status prescribed by section 5565 of this title, the head of the agency concerned or his designee shall make a finding of death when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that an employee in a missing status is dead.
<br>
<br>(c) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may determine the entitlement of an employee to pay and allowances under this subchapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that an employee captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.
<br>
<br>(d) When circumstances warrant the reconsideration of a determination made under this subchapter, the head of the agency concerned or his designee may change or modify it.
<br>
<br>(e) When the account of an employee has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this subchapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the employee if the head of the agency concerned or his designee determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the employee was not a party.
<br>
<br>(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from the pay and allowances of an employee for the period he is in a missing status may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment paid for a period after the end, under this subchapter or otherwise, of entitlement to pay and allowances may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of a deceased employee when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death.
<br>
<br>(g) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.
<br>
<br>(h) For the purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of an employee in active service is deemed an employee. A determination under this section made by the head of the agency concerned or his designee is conclusive on all other agencies of the United States. This section does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.

<br>
<br>(2) a survivor of a casualty to a ship, station, or military installation which results in the loss or destruction of disbursing records.
<br>
<br>That settlement is conclusive on the accounting officials of the United States in settling the accounts of disbursing officials.
<br>
<br>(b) Payment or settlement of an account made pursuant to a report, determination, or finding of death may not be recovered or reopened because of a later report or determination which fixes a date of death.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), subsections (a) and (b) of 5 App. U.S.C. 1117 are restated as definitions.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1)(A), the term "Executive agency" is substituted for "the executive branch of the Government of the United States, including each corporation wholly owned or controlled by the United States" and "the General Accounting Office" to conform to the definition in 5 U.S.C. 105.
