<br>(a) Annual assessments required
<br>
<br>For each nuclear weapon type in the stockpile of the United States, each official specified in subsection (b) on an annual basis shall, to the extent such official is directly responsible for the safety, reliability, performance, or military effectiveness of that nuclear weapon type, complete an assessment of the safety, reliability, performance, or military effectiveness (as the case may be) of that nuclear weapon type.
<br>(b) Covered officials
<br>
<br>The officials referred to in subsection (a) are the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The head of each national security laboratory.

<br>(2) The Commander of the United States Strategic Command.
<br>(c) Dual validation teams in support of assessments
<br>
<br>In support of the assessments required by subsection (a), the Administrator may establish teams, known as "dual validation teams", to provide each national security laboratory responsible for weapons design with independent evaluations of the condition of each warhead for which such laboratory has lead responsibility. A dual validation team established by the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be comprised of weapons experts from the laboratory that does not have lead responsibility for fielding the warhead being evaluated;
<br>

<br>The head of each national security laboratory shall establish and use one or more teams of experts, known as "red teams", to assist in the assessments required by subsection (a). Each such team shall include experts from both of the other national security laboratories. Each such team for a national security laboratory shall—
<br>
<br>(1) review both the matters covered by the assessments under subsection (a) performed by the head of that laboratory and any independent evaluations conducted by a dual validation team under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(2) subject such matters to challenge; and

<br>
<br>(ii) a discussion of why options other than an underground nuclear test are not available or would not resolve such issues.
<br>
<br>(B) An identification of the specific underground nuclear tests which, while not necessary, might have value in resolving any such issues and a discussion of the anticipated value of conducting such tests.
<br>
<br>(C) Such official's determination as to the readiness of the United States to conduct the underground nuclear tests identified under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B), if directed by the President to do so.
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) a discussion of the relative merits of other nuclear weapon types (if any), or compensatory measures (if any) that could be taken, that could enable accomplishment of the missions of the nuclear weapon types to which the assessments relate, should such assessments identify any deficiency with respect to such nuclear weapon types;
<br>
<br>(B) a summary of all major assembly releases in place as of the date of the report for the active and inactive nuclear weapon stockpiles; and

<br>(a) Establishment of program
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Energy shall establish and support a program to assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive ban on nuclear explosives testing is negotiated and ratified within the framework agreed to by the United States and the Russian Federation.
<br>(b) Purposes of program
<br>
<br>The purposes of the program under subsection (a) shall be the following:
<br>
<br>(1) To assure that the United States maintains a vigorous program of stockpile inspection and non-explosive testing so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban is entered into, the United States remains able to detect and identify potential problems in stockpile reliability and safety in existing designs of nuclear weapons.
<br>
<br>(2) To assure that the specific materials, components, processes, and personnel needed for the remanufacture of existing nuclear weapons or the substitution of alternative nuclear warheads are available to support such remanufacture or substitution if such action becomes necessary in order to satisfy reliability and safety requirements under a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement.
<br>
<br>(3) To assure that a vigorous program of research in areas related to nuclear weapons science and engineering is supported so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement is entered into, the United States is able to maintain a base of technical knowledge about nuclear weapons design and nuclear weapons effects.
<br>(c) Conduct of program
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the program provided for in subsection (a). The program shall be carried out with the participation of representatives of the Department of Defense, the nuclear weapons production facilities, and the national security laboratories.

<br>(e) Expression of individual views
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>No individual, including a representative of the President, may take any action against, or otherwise constrain, a director of a national security laboratory or a nuclear weapons production facility or a member of the Nuclear Weapons Council from presenting the professional views of the director or member, as the case may be, to the President, the National Security Council, or Congress regarding—

<br>"(1) rebuilding a robust plutonium pit production infrastructure with a capacity of up to 80 pits per year is critical to maintaining the viability of the nuclear weapons stockpile;
<br>
<br>"(2) that effort will require cooperation from experts across the nuclear security enterprise; and
<br>
<br>"(3) any further delay to achieving a plutonium sustainment capability to support the planned stockpile life extension programs will result in an unacceptable capability gap to our deterrent posture."
