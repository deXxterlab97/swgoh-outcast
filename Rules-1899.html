<br>§3706. Escrow of deposits and downpayments

The failure of the seller or the seller's agent to create such trust account and to maintain it until the deposit or payment has been disbursed for the benefit of the veteran purchaser at settlement or, if the transaction does not materialize, is otherwise disposed of in accordance with the terms of the contract, may constitute an unfair marketing practice within the meaning of section 3704(b) of this title.

<br>
<br>(A) the cost of the energy efficiency improvements, up to $3,000; or

<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3703(a)(1)(A) of this title, any loan guaranteed under this subsection shall be guaranteed in an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the guaranty that would be provided under those provisions for the dwelling without the energy efficiency improvements; and
<br>
<br>(B) an amount that bears the same relation to the cost of the energy efficiency improvements as the guaranty referred to in subparagraph (A) bears to the amount of the loan minus the cost of such improvements.
<br>
<br>(4) The amount of the veteran's entitlement, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 3703(a)(1) of this title, shall not be affected by the amount of the guaranty referred to in paragraph (3)(B).
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary shall take appropriate actions to notify eligible veterans, participating lenders, and interested realtors of the availability of loan guarantees under this subsection and the procedures and requirements that apply to the obtaining of such guarantees.

<br>
<br>(E) The term "residential energy conservation measure" means—
<br>
<br>(i) caulking and weatherstripping of all exterior doors and windows;
<br>

<br>
<br>(I) replacement burners, boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a reduction in the amount of fuel consumed as a result of increased combustion efficiency,
<br>
<br>(II) devices for modifying flue openings which will increase the efficiency of the heating system, and
<br>
<br>(III) electrical or mechanical furnace ignition systems which replace standing gas pilot lights;
<br>
<br>(iii) clock thermostats;
<br>
<br>(iv) ceiling, attic, wall, and floor insulation;

<br>
<br>(B) the loan must be secured by the same dwelling or farm residence as was the loan being refinanced;
<br>
<br>(C) the amount of the loan may not exceed—

<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a loan for the purpose specified in subsection (a)(11), an amount equal to the sum of the amount referred to with respect to the loan under clause (i) and the amount specified under subsection (d)(2);

<br>
<br>(E) the term of the loan may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced by more than 10 years; and

<br>
<br>(i) must occupy such dwelling or residence as such veteran's home;
<br>
<br>(ii) must have previously occupied such dwelling or residence as such veteran's home and must certify, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that the veteran has previously so occupied such dwelling or residence; or

<br>
<br>(2) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose. For purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.
<br>
<br>(3) If a veteran is deceased and if such veteran's surviving spouse was a co-obligor under an existing loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter, such surviving spouse shall, only for the purpose specified in subsection (a)(8) of this section, be deemed to be a veteran eligible for benefits under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in subclause (A)(ii) or (B)(ii) of subsection (a)(9) of this section, the purchase of (or the refinancing of a loan secured by) the manufactured home and the lot for that home shall be considered as one loan and must comply with such criteria as may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations.
<br>
<br>(2) A loan may not be guaranteed for the purposes of subsection (a)(9) of this section unless the manufactured home purchased, upon being permanently affixed to the lot, is considered to be real property under the laws of the State where the lot is located.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "veteran", when used with respect to a loan guaranteed or to be guaranteed under this chapter, includes the veteran's spouse if the spouse is jointly liable with the veteran under the loan.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of determining whether a veteran meets the standards referred to in subsection (b)(3) of this section and section 3712(e)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which establish—
<br>
<br>(A) credit underwriting standards to be used in evaluating loans to be guaranteed under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) standards to be used by lenders in obtaining credit information and processing loans to be guaranteed under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) In the regulations prescribed under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish standards that include—
<br>
<br>(A) debt-to-income ratios to apply in the case of the veteran applying for the loan;
<br>
<br>(B) criteria for evaluating the reliability and stability of the income of the veteran applying for the loan; and
<br>
<br>(C) procedures for ascertaining the monthly income required by the veteran to meet the anticipated loan payment terms.
<br>
<br>If the procedures described in clause (C) of this paragraph include standards for evaluating residual income, the Secretary shall, in establishing such standards, give appropriate consideration to State statistics (in States as to which the Secretary determines that such statistics are reliable) pertinent to residual income and the cost of living in the State in question rather than in a larger region.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Any lender making a loan under this chapter shall certify, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the lender has complied with the credit information and loan processing standards established under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and that, to the best of the lender's knowledge and belief, the loan meets the underwriting standards established under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) Any lender who knowingly and willfully makes a false certification under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the Secretary's loss on the loan involved or to another appropriate amount, not to exceed $10,000, whichever is greater.

<br>
<br>(B) the dwelling unit that the purchase of stock or membership in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation entitles the purchaser to occupy is a single family residential unit.
<br>
<br>(2) In this subsection, the term "cooperative housing corporation" has the meaning given such term in section 216(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
<br>
<br>(3) When applying the term "value of the property" to a loan guaranteed under subsection (a)(12), such term means the appraised value of the stock or membership entitling the purchaser to the permanent occupancy of the dwelling unit in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation.

L. 104–110, title II, §201(b), Feb. 13, 1996, 110 Stat. 770.
<br>§3711. Direct loans to veterans
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that housing credit for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title is not and has not been generally available to veterans living in rural areas, or in small cities and towns not near large metropolitan areas. It is therefore the purpose of this section to provide housing credit for veterans living in such rural areas and such small cities and towns.
<br>
<br>(b) Whenever the Secretary finds that private capital is not generally available in any rural area or small city or town for the financing of loans guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, the Secretary shall designate such rural area or small city or town as a "housing credit shortage area". The Secretary shall, with respect to any such area, make, or enter into commitments to make, to any veteran eligible under this title, a loan for any or all of the purposes described in section 3710(a) or 3712 of this title (other than the refinancing of a loan under section 3710(a)(8) or 3712(a)(1)(F)).
<br>
<br>(c) No loan may be made under this section to a veteran unless the veteran shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
<br>
<br>(1) the veteran is unable to obtain from a private lender in such housing credit shortage area, at an interest rate not in excess of the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, a loan for such purpose for which the veteran is qualified under section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(2) the veteran is unable to obtain a loan for such purpose from the Secretary of Agriculture under title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, not to exceed the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans, or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as may be applicable.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except for any loan made under this chapter for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title, the original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under section 3710 of this title at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000; and the guaranty entitlement of any veteran who heretofore or hereafter has been granted a loan under this section shall be charged with an amount which bears the same ratio to $36,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.
<br>
<br>(B) The original principal amount of any loan made under this section for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title shall not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under such section at the time the loan is made bears to $20,000. The amount of the guaranty entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title of any veteran who is granted a loan under this section, or who before October 18, 1978, was granted a loan under this section, shall be charged with the amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.
<br>
<br>(3) No veteran may obtain loans under this section aggregating more than $33,000.
<br>
<br>(e) Loans made under this section shall be repaid in monthly installments, except that in the case of any such loan made for any of the purposes described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may provide that such loan shall be repaid in quarterly, semiannual, or annual installments.
<br>
<br>(f) In connection with any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to pay taxes and assessments on the real estate, to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements, and to meet the incidental expenses of the transaction. The Secretary shall determine the expenses incident to origination of loans made under this section, which expenses, or a reasonable flat allowance in lieu thereof, shall be paid by the veteran in addition to the loan closing costs.
<br>
<br>(g) The Secretary may sell, and shall offer for sale, to any person or entity approved for such purpose by the Secretary, any loan made under this section at a price which the Secretary determines to be reasonable under the conditions prevailing in the mortgage market when the agreement to sell the loan is made; and shall guarantee any loan thus sold subject to the same conditions, terms, and limitations which would be applicable were the loan guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(h) The Secretary may exempt dwellings constructed through assistance provided by this section from the minimum land planning and subdivision requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3704 of this title, and with respect to such dwellings may prescribe special minimum land planning and subdivision requirements which shall be in keeping with the general housing facilities in the locality but shall require that such dwellings meet minimum requirements of structural soundness and general acceptability.
<br>
<br>(i) The Secretary is authorized, without regard to the provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, to make or enter into a commitment to make a loan to any veteran to assist the veteran in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit authorized under chapter 21 of this title, if the veteran is determined to be eligible for the benefits of such chapter 21, and is eligible for loan guaranty benefits under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(j)(1) If any builder or sponsor proposes to construct one or more dwellings in a housing credit shortage area, or in any area for a veteran who is determined to be eligible for assistance in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit under chapter 21 of this title, the Secretary may enter into commitment with such builder or sponsor, under which funds available for loans under this section will be reserved for a period not in excess of three months, or such longer period as the Secretary may authorize to meet the needs in any particular case, for the purpose of making loans to veterans to purchase such dwellings. Such commitment may not be assigned or transferred except with the written approval of the Secretary. The Secretary shall not enter into any such commitment unless such builder or sponsor pays a nonrefundable commitment fee to the Secretary in an amount determined by the Secretary, not to exceed 2 percent of the funds reserved for such builder or sponsor.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever the Secretary finds that a dwelling with respect to which funds are being reserved under this subsection has been sold, or contracted to be sold, to a veteran eligible for a direct loan under this section, the Secretary shall enter into a commitment to make the veteran a loan for the purchase of such dwelling. With respect to any loan made to an eligible veteran under this subsection, the Secretary may make advances during the construction of the dwelling, up to a maximum in advances of (A) the cost of the land plus (B) 80 percent of the value of the construction in place.
<br>

<br>
<br>(F) To refinance in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection an existing loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this section.
<br>
<br>(G) To refinance in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subsection an existing loan that was made for the purchase of, and that is secured by, a manufactured home and to purchase a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be placed.
<br>
<br>(2) A loan for any of the purposes described in paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than the refinancing under clause (F) of such paragraph of an existing loan) may include an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to cover the cost of necessary preparation of a lot already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, including the costs of installing utility connections and sanitary facilities, of paving, and of constructing a suitable pad for the manufactured home.
<br>
<br>(3) Any loan made for the purposes described in clause (C), (E), or (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered as part of one loan. The transaction may be evidenced by a single loan instrument or by separate loan instruments for (A) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the manufactured home, and (B) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the lot and the necessary preparation of such lot.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) the interest rate of the loan must be less than the interest rate of the loan being refinanced;
<br>
<br>(ii) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home or manufactured-home lot, or manufactured home and manufactured-home lot, as was the loan being refinanced;
<br>
<br>(iii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(A) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan;
<br>

<br>(vi) the veteran must own the manufactured home, or the manufactured-home lot, or the manufactured home and the manufactured-home lot, securing the loan and—

<br>
<br>(III) in any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as a home because of such status, the spouse of the veteran must occupy, or must have previously occupied, the manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as such spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.

<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of—

<br>
<br>(IV) such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(E) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan.
<br>
<br>(B) When a loan is made to a veteran for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title, and the loan being refinanced was guaranteed, insured, or made under this section, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing such loan may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such portion of such loan. For the purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such portion of such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Use of entitlement for purposes specified in this section for the purchase of a manufactured home unit shall preclude the use of remaining entitlement for the purchase of an additional manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall restore entitlement to all housing loan benefits under this chapter for the veteran when the conditions prescribed in section 3702(b) of this title have been met.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Loans for any of the purposes authorized by subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to the closing of the loan, except that the Secretary may exempt any lender of a class listed in section 3702(d) of this title from compliance with such prior approval requirement if the Secretary determines that the experience of such lender or class of lenders in manufactured home financing warrants such exemption.
<br>
<br>(2) Upon determining that a loan submitted for prior approval is eligible for guaranty for purposes specified in this section, the Secretary shall issue a commitment to guarantee such loan and shall thereafter guarantee the loan when made if such loan qualifies therefor in all respects.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Secretary's guaranty may not exceed the lesser of (i) the lesser of $20,000 or 40 percent of the loan, or (ii) the maximum amount of the guaranty entitlement available to the veteran as specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) A claim under the Secretary's guaranty shall, at the election of the holder of a loan, be made by the filing of an accounting with the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(i) within a reasonable time after the receipt by such holder of an appraisal by the Secretary of the value of the security for the loan; or
<br>
<br>(ii) after liquidation of the security for the loan.
<br>
<br>(C) If the holder of a loan applies for payment of a claim under clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the amount of such claim payable by the Secretary shall be the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total indebtedness over the amount of the appraisal referred to in such clause; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.
<br>
<br>(D) If the holder of a loan files for payment of a claim under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the amount of such claim payable by the Secretary shall be the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total indebtedness over the greater of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by the Secretary, or the amount of the liquidation or resale proceeds; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.
<br>
<br>(E) In any accounting filed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall permit to be included therein accrued unpaid interest from the date of the first uncured default to such cutoff date as the Secretary may establish, and the Secretary shall allow the holder of the loan to charge against the liquidation or resale proceeds accrued interest from the cutoff date established to such further date as the Secretary may determine and such costs and expenses as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and proper.
<br>
<br>(F) The liability of the United States under the guaranty provided for by this paragraph shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the obligation.
<br>
<br>(4) The maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to a veteran for purposes specified in this section shall be $20,000 reduced by the amount of any such entitlement previously used by the veteran. Use of entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3711 of this title shall reduce entitlement available for use for purposes specified in this section to the same extent that entitlement available for purposes specified in such section 3710 is reduced below $20,000.
<br>
<br>(5) The amount of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not exceed an amount equal to 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The maturity of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not be more than—
<br>
<br>(A) fifteen years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of a lot;
<br>
<br>(B) twenty years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of—
<br>
<br>(i) a single-wide manufactured home; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a single-wide manufactured home and a lot;
<br>
<br>(C) twenty-three years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of a double-wide manufactured home; or
<br>
<br>(D) twenty-five years and thirty-two days, in the case of a loan for the purchase of a double-wide manufactured home and a lot.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall preclude the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, from consenting to necessary advances for the protection of the security or the holder's lien, to a reasonable extension of the term of such loan, or to a reasonable reamortization of such loan.
