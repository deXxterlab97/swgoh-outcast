<br>17	With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul: and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him: and going over the Jordan,
<br>18	They passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king’s household, and do according to his commandment. And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan,
<br>19	Said to him: Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the king, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.
<br>20	For I thy servant acknowledge my sin: and therefore I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come down to meet my lord the king.
<br>21	But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said: Shall Semei for these words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord’s anointed?
<br>22	And David said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me?   shall there any man be killed this day in Israel? do not I know that this day I am made king over Israel?
<br>23	And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he swore unto him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard: nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his return in peace.
<br>25	And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him: Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?
<br>26	And he answering, said: My lord, O king, my servant despised me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on and go with the king: for I thy servant am lame. 27 Moreover he hath also accused me thy ser- vant to thee, my lord the king: but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do what pleaseth
<br>thee.
<br>28	For all of my father’s house were no better than worthy of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the guests of thy table: what just complaint there- fore have I? or what right to cry any more to the king?
<br>29	Then the king said to him: Why speakest thou any more? what I have said is determined: thou and Siba divide the possessions.
<br>30	And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.
<br>31	Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him beyond the river. 32 Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a man exceeding
<br>rich.
<br>33	And the king said to Berzellai: Come with me that thou mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem.
<br>34	And Berzellai said to the king: How many
<br> 
<br>are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
<br>35	I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet and bitter? or can meat or drink delight thy servant? or can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?
<br>36	I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee: I need not this recompense.
<br>37	But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the king, and do to him whatso- ever seemeth good to thee.
<br>38	Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.
<br>39	And when all the people and the king had passed over the Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him: and he returned to his own place.
<br>40	So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now all the people of Juda had brought the king over, and only half of the people of Israel were there.
<br>41	Therefore all the men of Israel running to- gether to the king, said to him: Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?
<br>42	And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king’s, or have any gifts been given us?
<br>43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: I have ten parts in the king more
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And there happened to be there a man of Be- lial, whose name was Seba, the son of Bochri, a man of Jemini: and he sounded the trumpet, and said: We have no part in David, nor inheri- tance in the son of Isai: return to thy dwellings, O Israel.
<br>2	And all Israel departed from David, and fol- lowed Seba the son of Bochri: but the men of Juda stuck to their king from the Jordan unto Jerusalem.
<br>3	And when the king was come into his house at Jerusalem, he took the ten women his concu- bines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them inward, allowing them provisions: and he went not in unto them, but they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood. 4 And the king said to Amasa: Assemble to me all the men of Juda against the third day,
<br>and be thou here present.
<br>5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Juda, but he tarried beyond the set time which the king had appointed him.
<br>6	And David said to Abisai: Now will Seba the son of Bochri do us more harm than did Ab- salom: take thou therefore the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find fenced cities, and escape us.
<br>7	So Joab’s men went out with him, and the Cerethi and the Phelethi: and all the valiant men went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.
<br> 
<br>8	And when they were at the great stone which is in Gabaon, Amasa coming met them. And Joab had on a close coat of equal length with his habit, and over it was girded with a sword hanging down to his flank, in a scabbard, made in such manner as to come out with the least motion and strike.
<br>9	And Joab said to Amasa: God save thee, my brother. And he took Amasa by the chin with his right hand to kiss him.
<br>10	But Amasa did not take notice of the sword, which Joab had, and he struck him in the side, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and gave him not a second wound, and he died. And Joab, and Abisai his brother pursued after Seba the son of Bochri.
<br>11	In the mean time some men of Joab’s com- pany stopping at the dead body of Amasa, said: Behold he that would have been in Joab’s stead the companion of David.
<br>12	And Amasa imbrued with blood, lay in the midst of the way. A certain man saw this that all the people stood still to look upon him, so he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and covered him with a garment, that they who passed might, not stop on his account.
<br>13	And when he was removed out of the way, all the people went on following Joab to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.
<br>14	Now he had passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abela and Bethmaacha: and all the chosen men were gathered together unto him.
<br>15	And they came, and besieged him in Abela, and in Bethmaacha, and they cast up works round the city, and the city was besieged: and all the people that were with Joab, laboured to throw down the walls.
<br>16	And a wise woman cried out from the city: Hear, hear, and say to Joab: Come near hither, and I will speak with thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	And when he was come near to her, she said to him: Art thou Joab? And he answered: I am. And she spoke thus to him: Hear the words of thy handmaid. He answered: I do hear.
<br>18	And she again said: A saying was used in the old proverb: They that inquire, let them inquire in Abela: and so they made an end.
<br>19	Am not I she that answer truth in Israel, and thou seekest to destroy the city, and to over- throw a mother in Israel? Why wilt thou throw down the inheritance of the Lord?
<br>20	And Joab answering said: God forbid, God forbid that I should, I do not throw down, nor destroy.
<br>21	The matter is not so, but a man of mount Ephraim, Seba the son of Bochri by name, hath lifted up his hand against king David: deliver him only, and we will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab: Behold his head shall be thrown to thee from the wall.
<br>22	So she went to all the people, and spoke to them wisely: and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bochri, and cast it out to Joab. And he sounded the trumpet, and they departed from the city, every one to their home: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
<br>23	So Joab was over all the army of Israel: and Banaias the son of Joiada was over the Cerethites and Phelethites,
<br>24	But Aduram over the tributes: and Jos- aphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.
<br>25	And Siva was scribe: and Sadoc and Abi- athar, priests.
<br>26	And Ira the Jairite was the priest of David.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And there was a famine in the days of David for three years successively: and David consulted
<br> 
<br>the oracle of the Lord. And the Lord said: It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he slow the Gabaonites.
<br>2	Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them: (Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Am- orrhites: and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for the children of Israel and Juda:)
<br>3	David therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? and what shall be the atonement or you, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?
<br>4	And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about silver and gold, but against Saul and against his house: neither do we desire that any man be slain of Israel. And the king said to them: What will you then that I should do for you?
<br>5	And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.
<br>6	Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify them to the Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen of the Lord. And the king said:  I will give them.
<br>7	And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord, that had been between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
<br>8	So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi:
<br>9	And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: and they crucified them on a hill before the Lord: and these seven died together
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to be reaped.
<br>10	And Respha the daughter of Aia took hair- cloth, and spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till water dropped upon them out of heaven: and suffered neither the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.
<br>11	And it was told David, what Respha the daughter of Aia, the concubine of Saul, had done. 12 And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged them when they had slain Saul in
<br>Gelboe.
<br>13	And he brought from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered up the bones of them that were crucified,
<br>14	And they buried them with the bones of Saul, and of Jonathan his son in the land of Ben- jamin, in the side, in the sepulchre of Cis his father: and they did all that the king had com- manded, and God shewed mercy again to the land after these things.
<br>15	And the Philistines made war again against Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David growing faint,
<br>16	Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Ara- pha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hun- dred ounces, being girded with a new sword, at- tempted to kill David.
<br>17	And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking the Philistine killed him. Then David’s men swore unto him saying: Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the lamp of Israel.
<br>18	There was also a second battle in Gob
<br> 
<br>against the Philistines: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of Arapha of the family of the giants.
<br>19	And there was a third battle in Gob against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an embroiderer of Bethlehem slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
<br>20	A fourth battle was in Geth: where there was a man of great stature, that had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, four and twenty in all, and he was of the race of Arapha. 21 And he reproached Israel: and Jonathan the son of Samae the brother of David slew him. 22 These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by the hand of David, and of his
<br>servants.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And David spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,
<br>2	And he said: The Lord is my rock, and my strength, and my saviour.
<br>3	God is my strong one, in him will I trust: my shield, and the horn of my salvation: he lifteth me up, and is my refuge: my saviour, thou wilt deliver me from iniquity.
<br>4	I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised: and I shall be saved from my enemies.
<br>5	For the pangs of death have surrounded me: the floods of Belial have made me afraid.
<br>6	The cords of hell compassed me: the snares of death prevented me.
<br>7	In my distress I will call upon the Lord, and I will cry to my God: and he will hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come to his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ears.
<br>8	The earth shook and trembled, the founda- tions of the mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was angry with them.
<br>9	A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a de- vouring fire out of his mouth: coals were kindled by it.
<br>10	He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
<br>11	And he rode upon the cherubims, and flew: and slid upon the wings of the wind.
<br>12	He made darkness a covering round about him: dropping waters out of the clouds of the heavens.
<br>13	By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were kindled.
<br>14	The Lord shall thunder from heaven: and the most high shall give forth his voice.
<br>15	He shot arrows and scattered them: light- ning, and consumed them.
<br>16	And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the spirit of his wrath.
<br>17	He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of many waters.
<br>18	He delivered me from my most mighty en- emy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
<br>19	He prevented me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord became my stay.
<br>20	And he brought me forth into a large place, he delivered me, because I pleased him.
<br>21	The Lord will reward me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands he will render to me.
<br>22	Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
<br>23	For all his judgments are in my sight: and his precepts I have not removed from me.
<br> 
<br>24	And I shall be perfect with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity.
<br>25	And the Lord will recompense me accord- ing to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his eyes.
<br>26	With the holy one thou wilt be holy: and with the valiant perfect.
<br>27	With the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.
<br>28	And the poor people thou wilt save: and with thy eyes thou shalt humble the haughty.
<br>29	For thou art my lamp O Lord: and thou, O Lord, wilt enlighten my darkness.
<br>30	For in thee I will run girded: in my God I will leap over the wall.
<br>31	God, his way is immaculate, the word of the Lord is tried by fire: he is the shield of all that trust in him.
<br>32	Who is God but the Lord: and who is strong but our God?
<br>33	God who hath girded me with strength, and made my way perfect.
<br>34	Making my feet like the feet of harts, and setting me upon my high places.
<br>35	He teacheth my hands to war: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass.
<br>36	Thou hast given me the shield of my sal- vation: and thy mildness hath multiplied me.
<br>37	Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall not fail.
<br>38	I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will not return again till I consume them.
<br>39	I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.
<br>40	Thou hast girded me with strength to bat- tle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>41	My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that hated me, and I shall destroy them.
<br>42	They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the Lord, and he shall not hear them.
<br>43	I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets.
<br>44	Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, shall serve me,
<br>45	The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will obey me.
<br>46	The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in their distresses.
<br>47	The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my salvation shall be ex- alted:
<br>48	God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under me,
<br>49	Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver me.
<br>50	Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.
<br>51	Giving great salvation to his king, and shewing mercy to David his anointed, and to his seed for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>Now these are David’s last words. David the son of Isai said: The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said:
<br>2 The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue.
<br> 
<br>3	The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God.
<br>4	As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain.
<br>5	Neither is my house so great with God, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured. For he is all my salvation, and all my will: neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up.
<br>6	But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands.
<br>7	And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with the staff of a lance: but they shall be set on fire and burnt to nothing.
<br>8	These are the names of the valiant men of David: Jesbaham sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one onset.
<br>9	After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the Philistines, and they were there gathered together to battle.
<br>10	And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.
<br>11	And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the Philistines were gathered to- gether in a troop: for there was a field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face of the Philistines,
<br>12	He stood in the midst of the field, and de- fended it, and defeated the Philistines: and the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord gave a great victory.
<br>13	Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants.
<br>14	And David was then in a hold: and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethle- hem.
<br>15	And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.
<br>16	And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord,
<br>17	Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did these three mighty men.
<br>18	Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,
<br>19	And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three first he attained not.
<br>20	And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.
<br>21	He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.
<br>22	These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.
<br>23	And he was renowned among the three
<br> 
<br>valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained not to the first three: and David made him of his privy council. 24 Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem.
<br>25	Semma of Harodi, Elica of Harodi,
<br>26	Heles of Phalti, Hira the son of Acces of Thecua,
<br>27	Abiezer of Anathoth, Mobonnai of Husati,
<br>28	Selmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Ne- tophathite,
<br>29	Heled the son of Baana, also a Ne- tophathite, Ithai the son of Ribai of Gabaath of the children of Benjamin,
<br>30	Banaia the Pharathonite, Heddai of the torrent Gaas,
<br>31	Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Beromi,
<br>32	Eliaba of Salaboni. The sons of Jassen, Jonathan,
<br>33	Semma of Orori, Aliam the son of Sarar the Arorite,
<br>34	Eliphelet   the   son   of   Aasbai   the   son of Machati, Eliam the son of Achitophel the Gelonite,
<br>35	Hesrai of Carmel, Pharai of Arbi,
<br>36	Igaal the son of Nathan of Soba, Bonni of Gadi,
<br>37	Selec of Ammoni, Naharai the Berothite, armourbearer of Joab the son of Sarvia,
<br>38	Ira the Jethrite, Gareb also a Jethrite;
<br>39	Urias the Hethite, thirty and seven in all.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>
<br>And the anger of the Lord was again kindled against Israel, and stirred up David among them, saying: Go, number Israel and Juda.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	And the king said to Joab the general of his army: Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and number ye the people that I may know the number of them.
<br>3	And Joab said to the king: The Lord thy God increase thy people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again multi- ply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king: but what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?
<br>4	But the king’s words prevailed over the words of Joab, and of the captains of the army: and Joab, and the captains of the soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
<br>5	And when they had passed the Jordan, they came to Aroer to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of Gad.
<br>6	And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of Dan. And going about by Sidon,
<br>7	They passed near the walls of Tyre, and all the land of the Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and they came to the south of Juda into Bersabee:
<br>8	And having gone through the whole land, after nine months and twenty days, they came to Jerusalem.
<br>9	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king, and there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword: and of Juda five hundred thou- sand fighting men.
<br>10	But David’s heart struck him, after the people were numbered: and David said to the Lord: I have sinned very much in what I have done: but I pray thee, O Lord, to take away the iniquity of thy servant, because I have done exceeding foolishly.
<br>11	And David arose in the morning, and the
<br> 
<br>word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David, saying:
<br>12	Go, and say to David: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee. 13 And when Gad was come to David, he told him, saying: Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land: or thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy land. Now therefore deliberate, and see what answer I shall return to him that
<br>sent me.
<br>14	And David said to Gad: I am in a great strait: but it is better that I should fall into the hands of the Lord (for his mercies are many) than into the hands of men.
<br>15	And the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning unto the time appointed, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersabee seventy thousand men.
<br>16	And when the angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction, and said to the angel that slew the people: It is enough: now hold thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.
<br>17	And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people: It is I; I am he that have sinned, I have done wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father’s house.
<br>18	And Gad came to David that day, and said: Go up, and build an altar to the Lord in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.
<br>19	And David went up according to the word of Gad which the Lord had commanded him.
<br>20	And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him:
<br> 
<br>
<br>21	And going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face to the earth, and said: Wherefore is my lord the king come to his ser- vant? And David said to him: To buy the thrashingfloor of thee, and build an altar to the Lord, that the plague, which rageth among the people, may cease.
<br>22	And Areuna said to David: Let my lord the king take, and offer, as it seemeth good to him: thou hast here oxen for a holocaust, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.
<br>23	All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king: and Areuna said to the king: The Lord thy God receive thy vow.
<br>24	And the king answered him, and said: Nay, but I will buy it of thee, at a price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God holocausts free cost. So David bought the floor, and the oxen, for fifty sicles of silver:
<br>25	And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered holocausts and peace offerings: and the Lord became merciful to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

<br>Third Book of Kings
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes he was not warm.
<br>2	His servants therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our Lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom and warm our lord the king.
<br>3	So they sought a beautiful young woman, in all the coasts of Israel and they found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.
<br>4	And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the king, and served him, but the king did not know her.
<br>5	And Adonias, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
<br>6	Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.
<br>7	And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar, the priest, who fur- thered Adonias’s side.
<br>8	But Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David’s army, was not with Adonias.
<br> 
<br>9	And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Juda, the king’s servants:
<br>10	But Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon, his brother, he invited not.
<br>11	And Nathan said to Bethsabee, the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias, the son of Haggith, reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?
<br>12	Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
<br>13	Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to me, thy handmaid, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?
<br>14	And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.
<br>15	So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old, and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.
<br>16	Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?
<br>17	She answered, and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid, by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>me, and he shall sit on my throne.
<br>18	And behold, now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.
<br>19	He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king’s sons, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the general of the army: but Solomon, thy servant, he invited not.
<br>20	And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Is- rael are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.
<br>21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I, and my son, Solomon, shall be accounted offend- ers.
<br>22	As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, came.
<br>23	And they told the king, saying: Nathan, the prophet, is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,
<br>24	Nathan said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?
<br>25	Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king’s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:
<br>26	But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Solomon, thy servant, he hath not invited.
<br>27	Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me, thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
<br>28	And king David answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to
<br> 
<br>the king, and stood before him,
<br>29	The king swore, and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all dis- tress,
<br>30	Even as I swore to thee, by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.
<br>31	And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.
<br>32	King David also said: Call me Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,
<br>33	He said to them: Take with you the ser- vants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:
<br>34	And let Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.
<br>35	And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.
<br>36	And Banaias, the son of Joiada, answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord, the God of my lord the king.
<br>37	As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.
<br>38	So Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, went down, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.
<br>39	And Sadoc, the priest, took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and they sounded the trumpet, and all the peo- ple said: God save king Solomon.
<br>40	And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.
<br>41	And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trum- pet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?
<br>42	While he yet spoke, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.
<br>43	And Jonathan answered Adonias:   Not so: for our lord, king David, hath appointed Solomon king;
<br>44	And hath sent with him Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king’s mule:
<br>45	And Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.
<br>46	Moreover, Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.
<br>47	And the king’s servants going in, have blessed ouur lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:
<br>48	And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.
<br>49	Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose, and every man went his way.
<br> 
<br>50	And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the horn of the altar.
<br>51	And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.
<br>52	And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.
<br>53	Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in, he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:
<br>2	I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself a man.
<br>3	And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayst understand all thou dost, and whitherso- ever thou shalt turn thyself:
<br>4	That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk be- fore me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.
<br>5	Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. 6 Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to hell in peace. 7 But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of
<br>Absalom, thy brother.
<br>8	Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with the sword:
<br>9	Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.
<br>10	So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
<br>11	And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.
<br>12	And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.
<br>13	And Adonias, the son of Haggith, came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? He answered: It is peaceable.
<br>14	And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:
<br>15	Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother’s: for it was appointed him by the Lord.
<br>16	Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face. And she said to him:
<br> 
<br>Say on.
<br>17	And he said I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.
<br>18	And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.
<br>19	Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right hand.
<br>20	And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee; do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother ask, for I must not turn away thy face.
<br>21	And she said: Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to Adonias, thy brother, to wife.
<br>22	And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom; for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Sarvia. 23 Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, say- ing: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his
<br>own life.
<br>24	And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David, my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.
<br>25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Ba- naias, the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died.
<br>26	And the king said also to Abiathar, the priest: Go to Anathoth, to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David, my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>father endured.
<br>27	So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Silo.
<br>28	And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and took hold on the horn of the altar.
<br>29	And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias, the son of Joiada, saying. Go, kill him.
<br>30	And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.
<br>31	And the king said to him: Do as he hath said; and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father:
<br>32	And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head; because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father, David, not knowing it; Ab- ner, the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether general of the army of Juda;
<br>33	And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed, and his house, and to his throne, be peace for ever from the Lord.
<br>34	So Banaias, the son of Joiada, went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.
<br>35	And the king appointed Banaias, the son
<br> 
<br>of Joiada in his room over the army; and Sadoc, the priest, he put in the place of Abiathar.
<br>36	The king also sent, and called for Se- mei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any where.
<br>37	For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.
<br>38	And Semei said to the king: The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<br>39	And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.
<br>40	And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth, to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.
<br>41	And it was told Solomon, that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.
<br>42	And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.
<br>43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?
<br>44	And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David, my father: the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head.
<br>45	And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>46	So the king commanded Banaias, the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck him; and he died.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity with Pharao, the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David: until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
<br>2	But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: for there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.
<br>3	And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David, his father; only he sacrificed in the high places, and burnt incense.
<br>4	He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the great high place: a thou- sand victims for holocausts, did Solomon offer upon that altar, in Gabaon.
<br>5	And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.
<br>6	And Solomon said: Thou hast shewed great mercy to thy servant David, my father, even as he walked before thee in truth, and justice, and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
<br>7	And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David, my father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in;
<br>8	And thy servant is in the midst of the peo- ple which thou hast chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for mul-
<br> 
<br>titude.
<br>9	Give therefore to thy servant an understand- ing heart, to judge thy people, and discern be- tween good and evil. For who shall be able to judge this people, thy people, which is so numer- ous?
<br>10	And the word was pleasing to the Lord, that Solomon had asked such a thing.
<br>11	And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life nor riches, nor the lives of thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern jndgment;
<br>12	Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a wise and un- derstanding heart, in so much that there hath been no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.
<br>13	Yea, and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given thee; to wit, riches and glory: so that no one hath been like thee among the kings in all days heretofore.
<br>14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my commandments, as thy fa- ther walked, I will lengthen thy days.
<br>15	And Solomon awaked, and perceived that it was a dream: and when he was come to Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered holocausts, and sacrificed victims of peace offerings, and made a great feast for all his servants.
<br>16	Then there came two women that were har- lots, to the king, and stood before him.
<br>17	And one of them said: I beseech thee, my lord, I and this woman dwelt in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber. 18 And the third day after I was delivered, she also was delivered; and we were together, and no other person with us in the house; only we two.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>19	And this woman’s child died in the night: for in her sleep she overlaid him.
<br>20	And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from my side, while I, thy handmaid, was asleep, and laid it in her bosom: and laid her dead child in my bosom.
<br>21	And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it was dead: but consider- ing him more diligently, when it was clear day, I found that it was not mine which I bore.
<br>22	And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayst, but thy child is dead, and mine is alive.   On the contrary, she said; Thou liest: for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they strove before the king.
<br>23	Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child is dead. And the other answereth: Nay; but thy child is dead, and mine liveth.
<br>24	The king therefore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had brought a sword before the king,
<br>25	Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.
<br>26	But the woman, whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her bowels were moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the child alive, and do not kill it. But the other said: Let it be neither mine nor thine; but divide it.
<br>27	The king answered, and said: Give the liv- ing child to this woman, and let it not be killed; for she is the mother thereof.
<br>28	And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And king Solomon reigned over all Israel:
<br>2	And these were the princes which he had: Azarias, the son of Sadoc, the priest:
<br>3	Elihoreph, and Ahia, the sons of Sisa, scribes: Josaphat, the son of Ahilud, recorder:
<br>4	Banaias, the son of Joiada, over the army: and Sadoc, and Abiathar, priests.
<br>5	Azarias, the son of Nathan, over them that were about the king: Zabud, the son of Nathan, the priest, the king’s friend:
<br>6	And Ahisar, governor of the house: and Adoniram, the son of Abda, over the tribute.
<br>7	And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and for his house hold: for every one provided neces- saries, each man his month in the year.
<br>8	And these are their names: Benhur, in mount Ephraim.
<br>9	Bendecar, in Macces, and in Salebim, and in Bethsames, and in Elon, and in Bethanan.
<br>10	Benhesed, in Aruboth: his was Socho, and all the land of Epher.
<br>11	Benabinadab, to whom belonged all Nephath-Dor: he had Tapheth, the daughter of Solomon, to wife.
<br>12	Bana, the son of Ahilud, who governed Thanac, and Mageddo, and all Bethsan, which is by Sarthana, beneath Jezrael, from Bethsan unto Abelmehula, over against Jecmaan.
<br>13	Bengaber, in Ramoth Galaad: he had the town of Jair, the son of Manasses, in Galaad: he was chief in all the country of Argob, which is in Basan, threescore great cities with walls, and brazen bolts.
<br>14	Ahinadab, the son of Addo, was chief in Manaim.
<br>15	Achimaas, in Nephthali: he also had Base- math, the daughter of Solomon, to wife.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	Baana, the son of Husi, in Aser, and in Baloth.
<br>17	Josaphat, the son of Pharue, in Issachar.
<br>18	Semei, the son of Ela, in Benjamin.
<br>19	Gaber, the son of Uri, in the land of Galaad, in the land of Sehon, the king of the Amorrhites, and of Og, the king of Basan, over all that were in that land.
<br>20	Juda and Israel were innumerable, as the sand of the sea in multitude; eating and drinking, and rejoicing.
<br>21	And Solomon had under him all the kingdoms, from the river to the land of the Philistines, even to the border of Egypt: and they brought him presents, and served him all the days of his life.
<br>22	And the provision of Solomon, for each day, was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal;
<br>23	Ten fat oxen, and twenty out of the pas- tures, and a hundred rams; besides venison of harts, roes, and buffles, and fatted fowls.
<br>24	For he had all the country which was be- yond the river, from Thaphsa to Gazan, and all the kings of those countries: and he had peace on every side round about.
<br>25	And Juda, and Israel, dwelt without any fear, every one under his vine, and under his fig tree, from Dan to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon.
<br>26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of chariot horses, and twelve thousand for the sad- dle.
<br>27	And the foresaid governors of the king fed them; and they furnished the necessaries also for king Solomon’s table, with great care, in their time.
<br>28	They brought barley also, and straw for the horses and beasts, to the place where the king was, according as it was appointed them.
<br> 
<br>29	And God gave to Solomon wisdom, and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, as the sand that is on the sea shore.
<br>30	And the wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the Orientals, and of the Egyp- tians;
<br>31	And he was wiser than all men: wiser than Ethan, the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chal- col, and Dorda, the sons of Mahol, and he was renowned in all nations round about.
<br>32	Solomon also spoke three thousand para- bles: and his poems were a thousand and five.
<br>33	And he treated about trees, from the cedar that is in Libanus, unto the hyssop that cometh out of the wall: and he discoursed of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
<br>34	And they came from all nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who heard of his wisdom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to Solomon: for he heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram had always been David’s friend.
<br>2	Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
<br>3	Thou knowest the will of David, my father, and that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars that were round about him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
<br>4	But now the Lord my God hath given me rest round about; and there is no adversary nor evil occurrence.
<br>5	Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon the throne, in thy place, he shall build
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a house to my name.
<br>6	Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down cedar trees, out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou knowest how there is not among my people a man that has skill to hew wood like to the Sidonians.
<br>7	Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given to David a very wise son over this numer- ous people.
<br>8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have heard all thou hast desired of me; and I will do all thy desire concerning cedar trees, and fir trees.
<br>9	My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put them together in floats, on the sea, and convey them to the place, which thou shalt signify to me, and will land them there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries to furnish food for my household.
<br>10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all his desire.
<br>11	And Solomon allowed Hiram twenty thou- sand measures of wheat, for provision for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram every year.
<br>12	And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a league together.
<br>13	And king Solomon chose workmen out of all Israel, and the levy was of thirty thousand men.
<br>14	And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns, so that two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.
<br>15	And Solomon had seventy thousand to
<br> 
<br>carry burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountain:
<br>16	Besides the overseers who were over every work, in number three thousand and three hun- dred, that ruled over the people, and them that did the work.
<br>17	And the king commanded that they should bring great stones, costly stones, for the founda- tion of the temple, and should square them:
<br>18	And the masons of Solomon, and the ma- sons of Hiram, hewed them: and the Giblians prepared timber and stones to build the house.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon over Israel, in the month Zio, (the same is the second month) he began to build a house to the Lord.
<br>2	And the house, which king Solomon built to the Lord, was threescore cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.
<br>3	And there was a porch before the temple, of twenty cubits in length, according to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it was ten cubits in breadth, before the face of the temple. 4 And he made in the temple oblique windows.
<br>5	And upon the wall of the temple, he built floors round about, in the walls of the house, round about the temple and the oracle, and he made chambers in the sides round about.
<br>6	The floor that was underneath was five cu- bits in breadth, and the middle floor was six cu- bits in breadth, and the third floor was seven cu- bits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>be fastened in the walls of the temple.
<br>7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in build- ing.
<br>8	The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house: and by winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the third.
<br>9	So he built the house, and finished it: and he covered the house with roofs of cedar.
<br>10	And he built a floor over all the house, five cubits in height, and he covered the house with timber of cedar.
<br>11	And the word of the Lord came to Solomon,
<br>12	As for this house, which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments, walking in them, I will fulfil my word to thee, which I spoke to David thy father.
<br>13	And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will not forsake my people Israel. 14 So Solomon built the house, and finished
<br>it.
<br>15	And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
<br>16	And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder part of the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle to be the holy of holies.
<br>17	And the temple itself, before the doors of the oracle, was forty cubits long.
<br>18	And all the house was covered within with cedar, having the turnings, and the joints thereof artfully wrought, and carvings projecting out:
<br> 
<br>all was covered with boards of cedar: and no stone could be seen in the wall at all.
<br>19	And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
<br>20	Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered it, and overlaid it with most pure gold. And the altar also he covered with cedar.
<br>21	And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold, and fastened on the plates with nails of gold.
<br>22	And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with gold: the whole altar of the oracle he covered also with gold.
<br>23	And he made in the oracle two cherubims of olive tree, of ten cubits in height.
<br>24	One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity of one wing to the extremity of the other wing.
<br>25	The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was the same in both the cherubims:
<br>26	That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other cherub.
<br>27	And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubims stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in the midst of the temple touched one another.
<br>28	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
<br>29	And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.
<br>31	And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive tree, snd posts of five corners, 32 And two doors of olive tree: and he carved upon them figures of cherubims, and figures of palm trees, and carvings very much projecting; and he overlaid them with gold: and he covered both the cherubims and the palm trees, and the
<br>other things, with gold.
<br>33	And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olive tree foursquare:
<br>34	And two doors of fir tree, one of each side: and each door was double, and so opened with folding leaves.
<br>35	And he carved cherubims, and palm trees, and carved work standing very much out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by rule.
<br>36	And he built the inner court with three rows of polished stones, and one row of beams of cedar.
<br>37	In the fourth year was the house of the Lord founded, in the month Zio:
<br>38	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul. (which is the eighth month) the house was finished in all the works thereof, and in all the appurtenances thereof: and he was seven years in building it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection.
<br>2 He built also the house of the forest of Libanus; the length of it was a hundred cu- bits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into pillars.
<br> 
<br>3	And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was held up with five and forty pillars. And one row had fifteen pillars,
<br>4	Set one against another,
<br>5	And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars, and over the pillars were square beams in all things equal.
<br>6	And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits in breadth: and an- other porch before the greater porch, and pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.
<br>7	He made also the porch of the throne wherein is the seat of judgment; and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.
<br>8	And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in judgment of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch;
<br>9	All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure, both within and with- out: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without, unto the great court.
<br>10	And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten cubits or eight cubits.
<br>11	And above there were costly stones of equal measure hewed, and in like manner planks of cedar.
<br>12	And the great court was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one row of planks of cedar, which also was observed in the inner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.
<br>13	And king Solomon sent, and brought Hi- ram from Tyre,
<br>14	The son of a widow woman, of the tribe of Nephthali, whose father was a Tyrian, an artifi- cer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understand- ing, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come to king Solomon, he wrought
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>all his work.
<br>15	And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.
<br>16	He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
<br>17	And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.
<br>18	And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did he to the other chapiter.
<br>19	And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily work, in the porch of four cubits.
<br>20	And again there were other chapiters on the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network: and of pomegranates there were two hundred, in rows round about the other chapiter.
<br>21	And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when he had set up the pil- lar on the right hand, he called the name thereof Jachin: in like manner he set up the second pil- lar, and called the name thereof Booz.
<br>22	And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished. 23 He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim, round all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits
<br>compassed it round about.
<br>24 And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten cubits going about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures. 25 And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which
<br> 
<br>three looked towards the north, and three to- wards the west, and three towards the south, and three towards the east: and the sea was above upon them, and their hinder parts were all hid within.
<br>26	And the laver was a hand breadth thick: and the brim thereof was like the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates.
<br>27	And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.
<br>28	And the work itself of the bases, was in- tergraven: and there were gravings between the joinings.
<br>29	And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and oxen, and cherubims; and in the joinings likewise above: and under the li- ons and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.
<br>30	And every base had four wheels, and axle- trees of brass: and at the four sides were un- dersetters, under the laver molten, looking one against another.
<br>31	The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the chapiter: and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round, and together it was one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were divers engravings: and the spaces between the pillars were square, not round.
<br>32	And the four whee]s, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
<br>33	And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and their axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.
<br>34	And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each base, were of the base itself, cast and joined together.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>35	And on the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a cubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its grav- ings, and divers sculptures of itself.
<br>36	He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the corners, cherubims, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a man stand- ing, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.
<br>37	After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure, and the like graving.
<br>38	He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bates, and was of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many lavers.
<br>39	And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple, and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple, over against the east southward.
<br>40	And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished all the work of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.
<br>41	The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the chapiters of the pillars: and the two networks, to cover the two cords, that were upon the top of the pillars.
<br>42	And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters, which were upon the tops of the pillars.
<br>43	And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.
<br>44	And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.
<br>45	And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the vessels that Hiram made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of fine brass.
<br>46	In the plains of the Jordan, did the king cast them in a clay ground, between Socoth and
<br> 
<br>Sartham.
<br>47	And Solomon placed all the vessels: but for its exceeding great multitude the brass could not be weighed.
<br>48	And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the ta- ble of gold, upon which the loaves of proposition should be set:
<br>49	And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on the left, over against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like lilies, and the lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,
<br>50	And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of most pure gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.
<br>51	And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the Lord, and brought in the things that David, his father, had dedicated, the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the house of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Then all the ancients of Israel, with the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the families of the children of Israel, were assembled to king Solomon, in Jerusalem: that they might carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, out of the city of David, that is, out of Sion.
<br>2	And all Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon, on the festival day, in the month of Ethanim, the same is the seventh month.
<br>3	And a]l the ancients of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark,
<br>4	And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the covenant, and all the vessels of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the sanctuary, that were in the tabernacle: and the priests and the Levites carried them.
<br>5	And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were assembled unto him, went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed sheep and oxen, that could not be counted or numbered.
<br>6	And tbe priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the or- acle of the temple, into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubims.
<br>7	For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and covered the ark, and the staves thereof above.
<br>8	And whereas the staves stood out, the ends of them were seen without, in the sanctuary be- fore the oracle, but were not seen farther out, and there they have been unto this day.
<br>9	Now in the ark there was nothing else but the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<br>10	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, that a cloud filled the house of the Lord,
<br>11	And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
<br>12	Then Solomon said: The Lord said that he would dwell in a cloud.
<br>13	Building, I have built a house for thy dwelling, to be thy most firm throne for ever.
<br>14	And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: for all the assembly of Israel stood.
<br>15	And Solomon said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David, my father, and with his own hands hath accomplished it, saying:
<br>16	Since the day that I brought my people
<br> 
<br>Israel, out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built, that my name might be there: but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
<br>17	And David, my father, would have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel: 18 And the Lord said to David, my father: Whereas, thou hast thought in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou hast done well in hav-
<br>ing this same thing in thy mind.
<br>19	Nevertheless, thou shalt not build me a house, but thy son, that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.
<br>20	The Lord hath performed his word which he spoke. And I stand in the room of David, my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised: and have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
<br>21	And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<br>22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the sight of the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,
<br>23	And said: Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on the earth beneath: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants, that have walked before thee with all their heart:
<br>24	Who hast kept with thy servant David, my father, what thou hast promised him: with thy mouth thou didst speak, and with thy hands thou hast performed, as this day proveth.
<br>25	Now, therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David, my father, what thou hast spoken to him, saying: There shall not be taken away of thee a man in my sight, to sit on the throne of Israel: yet so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou hast walked in my sight.
<br>26	And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy words be established, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David, my father.
<br>27	Is it then to be thought that God should indeed dwell upon earth? for if heaven, and the heavens of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built?
<br>28	But have regard to the prayer of thy ser- vant, and to his supplications, O Lord, my God: hear the hymn and the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day:
<br>29	That thy eyes may be open upon this house, night and day: upon the house of which thou hast said: My name shall be there: that thou mayst hearken to the prayer which thy ser- vant prayeth, in this place to thee:
<br>30	That thou mayst hearken to the suppli- cation of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whatsoever they shall pray for in this place, and hear them in the place of thy dwelling in heaven; and when thou hearest, shew them mercy.
<br>31	If any man trespass against his neighbour, and have an oath upon him, wherewith he is bound, and come, because of the oath, before thy altar, to thy house,
<br>32	Then hear thou in heaven: and do and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, and bringing his way upon his own head, and justi- fying the just, and rewarding him according to his justice.
<br>33	If thy people Israel shall fly before their enemies (because they will sin against thee) and doing penance, and confessing to thy name, shall come and pray, and make supplications to thee in this house:
<br>34	Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them back to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
<br>35	If heaven shall be shut up, and there shall
<br> 
<br>be no rain, because of their sins, and they, pray- ing in this place, shall do penance to thy name, and shall be converted from their sins, by occa- sion of their afflictions:
<br>36	Then hear thou them in heaven, and for- give the sins of thy servants, and of thy people Is- rael: and shew them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people in possession.
<br>37	If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence, or corrupt air, or blasting, or locust, or mildew; if their enemy afflict them, besieging the gates, whatsoever plague, whatsoever infirmity,
<br>38	Whatsoever curse or imprecation shall hap- pen to any man of thy people Israel: when a man shall know the wound of his own heart, and shall spread forth his hands in this house;
<br>39	Then hear thou in heaven, in the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and do so as to give to every one according to his ways, as thou shalt see his heart (for thou only knowest the heart of all the children of men)
<br>40	That they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the face of the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.
<br>41	Moreover also the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far conntry for thy name’s sake, (for they shall hear every where of thy great name, and thy mighty hand,
<br>42	And thy stretched out arm) so when he shall come, and shall pray in this place,
<br>43	Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy dwelling place, and do all those things, for which that stranger shall call upon thee: that all the people of the earth may learn to fear thy name, as do thy people Israel, and may prove that thy name is called upon on this house, which I have built.
<br>44	If thy people go out to war against their en-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>emies, by what way soever thou shalt send them, they shall pray to thee towards the way of the city, which thou hast chosen, and towards the house, which I have built to thy name:
<br>45	And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and do judgment for them.
<br>46	But if they sin against thee, (for there is no man who sinneth not) and thou being angry, deliver them up to their enemies, so that they be led away captives into the land of their enemies, far or near;
<br>47	Then if they do penance in their heart, in the place of captivity, and being converted, make supplication to thee in their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have committed wickedness:
<br>48	And return to thee with all their heart, and all their soul, in the land of their enemies, to which they have been led captives: and pray to thee towards the way of their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the temple which I have built to thy name:
<br>49	Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy throne, their prayers, and their supplica- tions, and do judgment for them:
<br>50	And forgive thy people, that have sinned against thee, and all their iniquities, by which they have transgressed against thee: and give them mercy before them that have made them captives, that they may have compassion on them.
<br>51	For they are thy people, and thy inheri- tance, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron. 52 That thy eyes may be open to the suppli- cation of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, to hear them in all things for which they shall
<br>call upon thee.
<br> 
<br>53	For thou hast separated them to thyself for an inheritance, from amongst all the people of the earth, as thou hast spoken by Moses, thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.
<br>54	And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and sup- plication to the Lord, that he rose from before the altar of the Lord: for he had fixed both knees on the ground, and had spread his hands towards heaven.
<br>55	And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:
<br>56	Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed so much as one word of all the good things that he promised by his servant Moses.
<br>57	The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers, and not leave us, nor cast us off:
<br>58	But may he incline our hearts to himself, that we may walk in all his ways, and keep his commandments, and his ceremonies, and all his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
<br>59	And let these my words, wherewith I have prayed before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may do judgment for his servant, and for his people Israel, day by day:
<br>60	That all the people of the earth may know, that the Lord he is God, and there is no other besides him.
<br>61	Let our hearts also be perfect with the Lord our God, that we may walk in his statutes, and keep his commandments, as at this day.
<br>62	And the king, and all Israel with him, of- fered victims before the Lord.
<br>63	And Solomon slew victims of peace of- ferings, which he sacrificed to the Lord, two
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king, and all the children of Israel, dedicated the temple of the Lord.
<br>64	In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lord for there he offered the holocaust, and sac- rifice, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the holocaust, and sacrifice, and the fat of the peace offerings.
<br>65	And Solomon made at the same time a solemn feast, and all Israel with him, a great multitude, from the entrance of Emath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, that is, fourteen days.
<br>66	And on the eighth day, he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and went to their dwellings, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for all the good things that the Lord had done for David, his servant, and for Israel, his people.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all that he desired and was pleased to do,
<br>2	That the Lord appeared to him the second time, as he had appeared to him in Gabaon.
<br>3	And the Lord said to him: I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, which thou hast made before me: I have sanctified this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes, and my heart, shall be there always.
<br>4	And if thou wilt walk before me, as thy fa- ther walked, in simplicity of heart, and in up- rightness: and wilt do all that I have commanded
<br> 
<br>thee, and wilt keep my ordinances, and my judg- ments,
<br>5	I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, as I promised David, thy father, saying: There shall not fail a man of thy race upon the throne of Israel.
<br>6	But if you and your children, revolting, shall turn away from following me, and will not keep my commandments, and my ceremonies, which I have set before you, but will go and worship strange gods, and adore them:
<br>7	I will take away Israel from the face of the land which I have given them; and the temple which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb, and a byword among all people.
<br>8	And this house shall be made an example of: every one that shall pass by it, shall be as- tonished, and shall hiss, and say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house? 9 And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange gods, and adored them, and worshipped them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all
<br>this evil.
<br>10	And when twenty years were ended, after Solomon had built the two houses; that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,
<br>11	(Hiram, the king of Tyre, furnishing Solomon with cedar trees, and fir trees, and gold, according to all he had need of) then Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 12 And Hiram came out of Tyre, to see the towns which Solomon had given him, and they
<br>pleased him not;
<br>13	And he said: Are these the cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day.
<br>14	And Hiram sent to king Solomon a hundred
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and twenty talents of gold.
<br>15	This is the sum of the expenses, which king Solomon offered to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer. 16 Pharao, the king of Egypt, came up and took Gazer, and burnt it with fire: and slew the Chanaanite that dwelt in the city, and gave it
<br>for a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
<br>17	So Solomon built Gazer, and Bethhoron the nether,
<br>18	And Baalath, and Palmira, in the land of the wilderness.
<br>19	And all the towns that belonged to him- self, and were not walled, he fortified; the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the horse- men, and whatsoever he had a mind to build in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.
<br>20	All the people that were left of the Am- orrhites, and Hethites, and Pherezites, and Hevites, and Jebusites, that are not of the chil- dren of Israel:
<br>21	Their children, that were left in the land; to wit, such as the children of Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary unto this day.
<br>22	But of the children of Israel, Solomon made not any to be bondmen, but they were warriors, and his servants, and his princes, and captains, and overseers of the chariots and horses.
<br>23	And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all the works of Solomon, and they had people under them, and had charge over the appointed works.
<br>24	And the daughter of Pharao came up out of the city of David to her house, which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Mello.
<br>25	Solomon also offered three times every year holocausts, and victims of peace offerings, upon
<br> 
<br>the altar which he had built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord: and the temple was finished.
<br>26	And king Solomon made a fleet in Asiongaber, which is by Ailath, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
<br>27	And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
<br>28	And they came to Ophir; and they brought from thence to king Solomon four hundred and twenty talents of gold.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And the queen of Saba having heard of the fame of Solomon in the name of the Lord, came to try him with hard questions.
<br>2	And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and camels that carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and precious stones, she came to king Solomon, and spoke to him all that she had in her heart.
<br>3	And Solomon informed her of all the things she proposed to him: there was not any word the king was ignorant of, and which he could not answer her.
<br>4	And when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
<br>5	And the meat of his table, and the apart- ments of his servants, and the order of his minis- ters, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and the holocausts, which he offered in the house of the Lord, she had no longer any spirit in her;
<br>6	And she said to the king: The report is true, which I heard in my own country,
<br>7	Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. And I did not believe them that told
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes, and have found that the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy works exceed the fame which I heard.
<br>8	Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, who stand before thee always, and hear thy wisdom.
<br>9	Blessed be the Lord thy God, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord hath loved Is- rael for ever, and hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice.
<br>10	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones: there was brought no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.
<br>11	(The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir great plenty of thyine trees, and precious stones.
<br>12	And the king made of the thyine trees the rails of the house of the Lord, and of the king’s house: and citterns and harps for singers: there were no such thyine trees as these brought nor seen unto this day.)
<br>13	And king Solomon gave the queen of Saba all that she desired, and asked of him: besides what he offered her of himself of his royal bounty. And she returned, and went to her own country, with her servants.
<br>14	And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:
<br>15	Besides that which the men brought him that were over the tributes, and the merchants, and they that sold by retail, and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the country.
<br>16	And Solomon made two hundred shields of the purest gold: he allowed six hundred sicles of gold for the plates of one shield.
<br> 
<br>17	And three hundred targets of fine gold: three hundred pounds of gold covered one tar- get: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Libanus.
<br>18	King Solomon also made a great throne of ivory: and overlaid it with the finest gold.
<br>19	It had six steps: and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions stood, one at each hand,
<br>20	And twelve little lions stood upon the six steps, on the one side and on the other: there was no such work made in any kingdom.
<br>21	Moreover, all the vessels out of which king Solomon drank, were of gold: and all the furni- ture of the house of the forest of Libanus was of most pure gold: there was no silver, nor was any account made of it in the days of Solomon:
<br>22	For the king’s navy, once in three years, went with the navy of Hiram by sea to Tharsis, and brought from thence gold, and silver, and elephants’ teeth, and apes, and peacocks.
<br>23	And king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
<br>24	And all the earth desired to see Solomon’s face, to hear his wisdom, which God had given in his heart.
<br>25	And every one brought him presents, ves- sels of silver and of gold, garments, and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules, every year.
<br>26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hun- dred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he bestowed them in fenced cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.
<br>27	And he made silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones: and cedars to be as com- mon as sycamores which grow in the plains.
<br>28	And horses were brought for Solomon out of Egypt, and Coa: for the king’s merchants
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>bought them out of Coa, and brought them at a set price.
<br>29	And a chariot of four horses came out of Egypt, for six hundred sicles of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And after this manner did all the kings of the Hethites, and of Syria, sell horses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And king Solomon loved many strange women, besides the daughter of Pharao, and women of Moab, and of Ammon, and of Edom, and of Sidon, and of the Hethites:
<br>2	Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel: You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come into yours: for they will most certainly turn away your hearts to follow their gods. And to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love.
<br>3	And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred concubines: and the women turned away his heart.
<br>4	And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, his father.
<br>5	But Solomon worshipped Astarthe, the god- dess of the Sidonians, and Moloch, the idol of the Ammonites.
<br>6	And Solomon did that which was not pleas- ing before the Lord, and did not fully follow the Lord, as David, his father.
<br>7	Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos, the idol of Moab, on the hill that is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch, the idol of the chil- dren of Ammon.
<br>8	And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt incense, and of-
<br> 
<br>fered sacrifice to their gods.
<br>9	And the Lord was angry with Solomon, be- cause his mind was turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice;
<br>10	And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord com- manded him.
<br>11	The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Be- cause thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have com- manded thee, I will divide and rend thy king- dom, and will give it to thy servant.
<br>12	Nevertheless, in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
<br>13	Neither will I take away the whole king- dom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for the sake of David, my servant, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen.
<br>14	And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad, the Edomite, of the king’s seed, in Edom.
<br>15	For when David was in Edom, and Joab, the general of the army, was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in Edom,
<br>16	(For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had slain every male in Edom,) 17 Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants, with him, to go into Egypt:
<br>and Adad was then a Iittle boy.
<br>18	And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt, to Pharao, the king of Egypt: who gave him a house, and ap- pointed him victuals, and assigned him land.
<br>19	And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>own sister of his wife, Taphnes, the queen.
<br>20	And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son, Genubath; and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children.
<br>21	And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab, the general of the army, was dead, he said to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
<br>22	And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing; yet I beseech thee to let me go.
<br>23	God also raised up against him an adver- sary, Razon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Adarezer, the king of Soba.
<br>24	And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of robbers, when David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damas- cus.
<br>25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon: and this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel; and he reigned in Syria.
<br>26	Jeroboam also, the son of Nabat, an Ephrathite, of Sareda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.
<br>27	And this is the cause of his rebellion against him; for Solomon built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David, his father.
<br>28	And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him a young man in- genious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the house of Joseph.
<br>29	So it came to pass at that time, that Jer- oboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias, the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone
<br> 
<br>in the field.
<br>30	And Ahias taking his new garment, where- with he was clad, divided it into twelve parts:
<br>31	And he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.
<br>32	But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant, David, and Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:
<br>33	Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos, the god of Moab, and Moloch, the god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments, as did David, his father.
<br>34	Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments, and my precepts.
<br>35	But I will take away the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give thee ten tribes:
<br>36	And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my servant, David, before me always in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen, that my name might be there.
<br>37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.
<br>38	If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my command- ments and my precepts, as David, my servant, did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel to thee:
<br>39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>but yet not for ever.
<br>40	Solomon, therefore, sought to kill Jer- oboam: but he arose, and fled into Egypt, to Sesac, the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
<br>41	And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did and his wisdom: behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days of Solomon.
<br>42	And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all Israel, were forty years.
<br>43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David, his father; and Roboam, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither were all Israel come together to make him king.
<br>2	But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was yet in Egypt, a fugitive from the face of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned out of Egypt.
<br>3	And they sent and called him: and Jer- oboam came, and all the multitude of Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:
<br>4	Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now, therefore, do thou take off a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most heavy yoke, which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
<br>5	And he said to them: Go till the third day, and come to me again. And when the people was gone,
<br>6	King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before Solomon, his father, while he yet lived, and he said: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people?
<br>7	They said to him:    If thou wilt yield to
<br> 
<br>this people to day, and condescend to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle words to them, they will be thy servants always.
<br>8	But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had been brought up with him, and stood before him.
<br>9	And he said to them: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people, who have said to me: Make the yoke, which thy father put upon us, lighter?
<br>10	And the young men that had been brought up with him, said: Thus shalt thou speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease us. Thou shalt say to them: My little finger is thicker than the back of my father.
<br>11	And now my father put a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to your yoke: my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpi- ons.
<br>12	So Jeroboam, and all the people, came to Roboam the third day, as the king had ap- pointed, saying: Come to me again the third day. 13 And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old men, which they
<br>had given him,
<br>14	And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.
<br>15	And the king condescended not to the peo- ple: for the Lord was turned away from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias, the Silonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
<br>16	Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered him, say- ing: What portion have we in David? or what
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>inheritance in the son of Isai? Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel: now, David, look to thy own house. So Israel departed to their dwellings.
<br>17	But as for all the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda, Roboam reigned over them.
<br>18	Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all Israel stoned him, and he died. Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get him up into his chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem:
<br>19	And Israel revolted from the house of David, unto this day.
<br>20	And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they gath- ered an assembly, and sent and called him, and made him king over all Israel, and there was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Juda only.
<br>21	And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gath- ered together all the house of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred fourscore thousand cho- sen men for war, to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the kingdom again under Roboam, the son of Solomon.
<br>22	But the word of the Lord came to Semeias, the man of God, saying:
<br>23	Speak to Roboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying:
<br>24	Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren, the children of Israel: let every man return to his house, for this thing is from me. They hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned from their journey, as the Lord had commanded them.
<br>25	And Jeroboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and going out from thence, he built Phanuel.
<br>26	And Jeroboam said in his heart: Now shall
<br> 
<br>the kingdom return to the house of David,
<br>27	If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem: and the heart of this people will turn to their lord Roboam, the king of Juda, and they will kill me, and return to him.
<br>28	And finding out a device, he made two golden calves, and said to them: Go ye up no more to Jerusalem: Behold thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<br>29	And he set the one in Bethel, and the other in Dan:
<br>30	And this thing became an occasion of sin: for the people went to adore the calf as far as Dan.
<br>31	And he made temples in the high places, and priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
<br>32	And he appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, af- ter the manner of the feast that was celebrated in Juda. And going up to the altar, he did in like manner in Bethel, to sacrifice to the calves, which he had made: and he placed in Bethel priests of the high places, which he had made.
<br>33	And he went up to the altar, which he had built in Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast to the children of Israel, and went up on the altar to burn incense.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And behold there came a man of God out of Juda, by the word of the Lord, to Bethel, when Jeroboam was standing upon the altar, and burning incense.
<br>2	And he cried out against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said: O altar, altar, thus
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>saith the Lord: Behold a child shall be born to the house of David, Josias by name, and he shall immolate upon thee the priests of the high places, who now burn incense upon thee, and he shall burn men’s bones upon thee.
<br>3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying: This shall be the sign, that the Lord hath spoken: Behold the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it, shall be poured out.
<br>4	And when the king had heard the word of the man of God, which he had cried out against the altar in Bethel, he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying: Lay hold on him. And his hand which he stretched forth against him, withered: and he was not able to draw it back again to him.
<br>5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given before in the word of the Lord.
<br>6	And the king said to the man of God: En- treat the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. And the man of God besought the face of the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.
<br>7	And the king said to the man of God: Come home with me to dine, and I will make thee presents.
<br>8	And the man of God answered the king: If thou wouldst give me half thy house, I will not go with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in this place:
<br>9	For so it was enjoined me by the word of the Lord commanding me: Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way that thou camest.
<br>10	So he departed by another way, and re- turned not by the way that he came into Bethel. 11 Now a certain old prophet dwelt in Bethel,
<br> 
<br>and his sons came to him, and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: and they told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.
<br>12	And their father said to them: What way went he? His sons shewed him the way by which the man of God went, who came out of Juda.
<br>13	And he said to his sons: Saddle me the ass.
<br>And when they had saddled it, he got up,
<br>14	And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a turpentine tree: and he said to him: Art thou the man of God who camest from Juda?  He answered:  I am.
<br>15	And he said to him: Come home with me to eat bread.
<br>16	But he said: I must not return, nor go with thee, neither will I eat bread, or drink water in this place:
<br>17	Because the Lord spoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying: Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water there, nor return by the way thou wentest.
<br>18	He said to him: I also am a prophet like unto thee: and an angel spoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him,
<br>19	And brought him back with him: so he ate bread, and drank water in his house.
<br>20	And as they sat at table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back: 21 And he cried out to the man of God who came out of Juda, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast not been obedient to the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the
<br>Lord thy God commanded thee,
<br>22 And hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink water, thy dead body shall not be brought into
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the sepulchre of thy fathers.
<br>23	And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the prophet, whom he had brought back.
<br>24	And when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed him, and his body was cast in the way: and the ass stood by him, and the lion stood by the dead body.
<br>25	And behold, men passing by, saw the dead body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city, wherein that old prophet dwelt.
<br>26	And when that prophet, who had brought him back out of the way, heard of it, he said: It is the man of God, that was disobedient to the mouth of the Lord, and the Lord hath delivered him to the lion, and he hath torn him, and killed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to him.
<br>27	And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass.
<br>And when they had saddled it,
<br>28	And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten of the dead body, nor hurt the ass.
<br>29	And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and going back brought it into the city of the old prophet, to mourn for him.
<br>30	And he laid his dead body in his own sepul- chre: and they mourned over him, saying: Alas! alas, my brother.
<br>31	And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons: When I am dead, bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.
<br>32	For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold in the word of the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel: and against all the temples of the high places, that are in the
<br> 
<br>cities of Samaria.
<br>33	After these words, Jeroboam came not back from his wicked way: but on the contrary, he made of the meanest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a priest of the high places.
<br>34	And for this cause did the house of Jer- oboam sin, and was cut off, and destroyed from the face of the earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>At that time Abia, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick. 2 And Jeroboam said to his wife: Arise, and change thy dress, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Silo, where Ahias, the prophet is, who told me that I should
<br>reign over this people.
<br>3	Take also with thee ten loaves, and crack- nels, and a pot of honey, and go to him: for he will tell thee what will become of this child.
<br>4	Jeroboam’s wife did as he told her: and ris- ing up, went to Silo, and came to the house of Ahias; but he could not see, for his eyes were dim by reason of his age.
<br>5	And the Lord said to Ahias: Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh in, to consult thee concern- ing her son, that is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak to her. So when she was coming in, and made as if she were another woman,
<br>6	Ahias heard the sound of her feet, coming in at the door, and said: Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam: why dost thou feign thyself to be an- other? But I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 7 Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: For as much as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince
<br>over my people Israel;
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8 And rent the kingdom away from thc house of David, and gave it to thee, and thou hast not been as my servant, David, who kept my com- mandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight: 9 But hast done evil above all that were be- fore thee, and hast made thee strange gods, and molten gods, to provoke me to anger, and hast
<br>cast me behind thy back:
<br>10	Therefore, behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house of Jer- oboam, as dung is swept away till all be clean.
<br>11	Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the Lord hath spoken it.
<br>12	Arise thou, therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet shall be entering into the city, the child shall die,
<br>13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall be laid in a sepulchre, because in his regard there is found a good word from the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
<br>14	And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:
<br>15	And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water: and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke the Lord.
<br>16	And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.
<br>17	And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and de-
<br> 
<br>parted, and came to Thersa: and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died,
<br>18	And they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias, the prophet.
<br>19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.
<br>20	And the days that Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fa- thers: and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead. 21 And Roboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Juda: Roboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seven- teen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Naama,
<br>an Ammonitess.
<br>22	And Juda did evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him above all that their fathers had done, in their sins which they committed.
<br>23	For they also built them altars, and stat- ues, and groves, upon every high hill, and under every green tree:
<br>24	There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the people, whom the Lord had destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.
<br>25	And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
<br>26	And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the king’s treasures, and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which Solomon had made:
<br>27	And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered them into the hand of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>captains of the shieldbearers, and of them that kept watch before the gate of the king’s house.
<br>28	And when the king went into the house of the Lord, they whose office it was to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they brought them back to the armoury of the shieldbearers.
<br>29	Now the rest of the acts of Roboam, and all that he did, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda.
<br>30	And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam always.
<br>31	And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them, in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naama, an Ammonitess: and Abiam, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>Now in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jer- oboam, the son of Nabat, Abiam reigned over Juda.
<br>2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom.
<br>3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, his father.
<br>4	But for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
<br>5	Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and had not turned aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life, except the matter of Urias, the Hethite.
<br>6	But there was war between Roboam and Jer- oboam all the time of his life.
<br>7	And the rest of the words of Abiam, and all
<br> 
<br>that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And there was war between Abiam and Jeroboam.
<br>8	And Abiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br>9	So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, reigned Asa, king of Juda,
<br>10	And he reigned one and forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom.
<br>11	And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as did David, his father:
<br>12	And he took away the effeminate out of the land, and removed all the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made.
<br>13	Moreover, he also removed his mother, Maacha, from being the princess in the sacri- fices of Priapus, and in the grove which she had consecrated to him: and he destroyed her den, and broke in pieces the filthy idol, and burnt it by the torrent Cedron:
<br>14	But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days:
<br>15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and he had vowed, into the house of the Lord, silver and gold, and vessels.
<br>16	And there was war between Asa, and Baasa, king of Israel, all their days.
<br>17	And Baasa, king of Israel, went up against Juda, and built Rama, that no man might go out or come in of the side of Asa, king of Juda.
<br>18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered it into the hands of his servants: and sent them to Benadad, son of Tabremon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>19	There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: therefore I have sent thee presents of silver and gold: and I desire thee to come, and break thy league with Baasa, king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
<br>20	Benadad, hearkening to king Asa, sent the captains of his army against the cities of Israel, and they smote Ahion, and Dan, and Abeldo- mum Maacha, and all Cenneroth; that is all the land of Nephthali.
<br>21	And when Baasa had heard this, he left off building Rama, and returned into Thersa.
<br>22	But king Asa sent word into all Juda, say- ing: Let no man be excused: and they took away the stones from Rama, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had been building, and with them king Asa built Gabaa of Benjamin, and Maspha.
<br>23	But the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his strength, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
<br>24	And he slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, his father. And Josaphat, his son, reigned in his place.
<br>25	But Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel the second year of Asa, king of Juda: and he reigned over Israel two years.
<br>26	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
<br>27	And Baasa, the son of Ahias, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him, and slew him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the Philistines: for Nadab and all Israel besieged Gebbethon.
<br>28	So Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa, king of Juda, and reigned in his place.
<br> 
<br>29	And when he was king, he cut off all the house of Jeroboam: he left not so much as one soul of his seed, till he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias, the Silonite:
<br>30	Because of the sin of Jeroboam, which he had sinned, and wherewith he had made Israel to sin, and for the offence wherewith he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel.
<br>31	But the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
<br>32	And there was war between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, all their days.
<br>33	In the third year of Asa, king of Juda, Baasa, the son of Ahias, reigned over all Israel, in Thersa, four and twenty years.
<br>34	And he did evil before the Lord, and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sins, where- with he made Israel to sin.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, against Baasa, saying:
