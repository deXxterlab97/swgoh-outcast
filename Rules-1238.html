<br>
<br>(B) Requiring the recipient to terminate a subcontract or subgrant.
<br>
<br>(C) Suspending payments under the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement until such time as the recipient of the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement has taken appropriate remedial action.

<br>(4) Aggravating factor
<br>
<br>Where applicable, the head of an executive agency may consider the failure of a contractor or grantee to abate an alleged violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan when directed by a contracting officer pursuant to subsection (a)(1) as an aggravating factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.
<br>(d) Inclusion of report conclusions in FAPIIS

In addition, such programs and initiatives shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include the following:

<br>
<br>(B) Support for nongovernmental organizations and advocates to provide legal, social, and other services and assistance to trafficked individuals, particularly those individuals in detention, and by facilitating contact between relevant foreign government agencies and such nongovernmental organizations to facilitate cooperation between the foreign governments and such organizations.

<br>(F) No requirement of official certification for United States citizens and lawful permanent residents
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section may be construed to require United States citizens or lawful permanent residents who are victims of severe forms of trafficking to obtain an official certification from the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to access any of the specialized services described in this subsection or any other Federal benefits and protections to which they are otherwise entitled.

<br>
<br>In selecting recipients of grants under this paragraph that are only available for law enforcement operations or task forces, the Attorney General may give priority to any applicant that files an attestation with the Attorney General stating that—
<br>
<br>(i) the grant funds awarded under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(I) will be used to assist in the prevention of severe forms of trafficking in persons;
<br>
<br>(II) will be used to strengthen efforts to investigate and prosecute those who knowingly benefit financially from participation in a venture that has engaged in any act of human trafficking;
<br>
<br>(III) will be used to take affirmative measures to avoid arresting, charging, or prosecuting victims of human trafficking for any offense that is the direct result of their victimization; and
