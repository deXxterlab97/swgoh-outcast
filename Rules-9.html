<br>Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 16And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and dash it round about against the altar. 17And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head. 18And thou shalt make the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt- offering unto the LORD; it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 19And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 20Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and dash the blood against the altar round about. 21And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons’garments with him. 22Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh; for it is a ram of consecration; 23and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is
<br> 
<br>before the LORD. 24And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 25And thou shalt take them from their hands, and make them smoke on the altar upon the burnt- offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 26And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave- offering before the LORD; and it shall be thy portion. 27And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave- offering, and the thigh of the heave- offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is Aaron’s, and of that which is his sons’. 28And it shall be for Aaron and his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of their sacrifices of peace- offerings, even their heave-offering unto the LORD. 29And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them. 30Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, even he who cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. 31And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and seethe its flesh in a holy place. 32And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of
<br> 
<br>meeting. 33And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 34And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 35And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 36And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin- offering, beside the other offerings of atonement; and thou shalt do the purification upon the altar when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 37Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; thus shall the altar be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
<br>38Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 39The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk. 40And with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering. 41And the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made
<br> 
<br>by fire unto the LORD. 42It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee. 43And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and [the Tent] shall be sanctified by My glory. 44And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar; Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to Me in the priest’s office. 45And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 46And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.
<br>And thou shalt make an altar to   burn   incense   upon;   of
<br>acacia-wood shalt thou make it. 2A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. 3And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it. 5And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold. 6And thou shalt put it before the
<br> 
<br>veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the ark-cover that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 7And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices; every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. 8And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 9Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt- offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon. 10And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most holy unto the LORD.’

<br>11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 12’When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 13This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary—the shekel is twenty gerahs—half a shekel for an offering to the LORD. 14Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of the LORD. 15The rich shall not give more, and the poor
<br> 
<br>shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of the LORD, to make atonement for your souls. 16And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for your souls.’
<br>17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 18’Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 19And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; 20when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto the LORD; 21so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.’
<br>22Moreover the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 23’Take thou also unto thee the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, 24and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. 25And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded
<br> 
<br>after the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. 26And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 27and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, 28and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. 29And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 30And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 31And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations. 32Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof; it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. 33Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’
<br>34And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense; of each shall there be a like weight. 35And thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. 36And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.
<br> 
<br>37And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves; it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 38Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.’
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’See, I have
<br>called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 3and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 5and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: 7the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the ark-cover that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent; 8and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense; 9and the altar of burnt- offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base; 10and the plaited garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office; 11and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet  spices for the holy
<br> 
<br>place; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.’
<br>12And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 13’Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying: Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the LORD who sanctify you. 14Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD; whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.’
<br>18And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
<br>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down
<br>from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him: ‘Up, make us a god who shall go before us; for as for this
<br> 
<br>Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.’ 2And Aaron said unto them: ‘Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.’ 3And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 4And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said: ‘This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ 5And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said: ‘To-morrow shall be a feast to the LORD.’ 6And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt- offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to make merry.
<br>7And the LORD spoke unto Moses: ‘Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have dealt corruptly; 8they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said: This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ 9And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people. 10Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume
<br> 
<br>them; and I will make of thee a great nation.’ 11And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said: ‘LORD, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people, that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 12Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying: For evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against Thy people. 13Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self, and saidst unto them: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.’ 14And the LORD repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.
<br>15And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 16And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 17And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses: ‘There is a noise of war in the camp.’ 18And he said: ‘It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome, but the
<br> 
<br>noise of them that sing do I hear.’ 19And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses’anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount. 20And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 21And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?’ 22And Aaron said: ‘Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil. 23So they said unto me: Make us a god, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 24And I said unto them: Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off; so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.’ 25And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose—for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies— 26then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: ‘Whoso is on the LORD’S side, let him come unto me.’ And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 27And he said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his
<br> 
<br>brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.’ 28And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 29And Moses said: ‘Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, for every man hath been against his son and against his brother; that He may also bestow upon you a blessing this day.’ 30And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: ‘Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the LORD, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.’ 31And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: ‘Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold. 32Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.’ 33And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. 34And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.’ 35And the LORD smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses: ‘Depart, go up hence,
<br>thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I swore unto Abraham,   to   Isaac,   and   to   Jacob,
<br> 
<br>saying: Unto thy seed will I give it— 2and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite— 3unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee in the way.’ 4And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man did put on him his ornaments. 5And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.’ 6And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
<br>7Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought the LORD went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp. 8And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. 9And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent; and [the LORD] spoke with Moses. 10And when all the people saw the pillar of
<br> 
<br>cloud stand at the door of the Tent, all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. 11And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
<br>12And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘See, Thou sayest unto me: Bring up this people; and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in My sight. 13Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee, to the end that I may find grace in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people.’ 14And He said: ‘My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.’ 15And he said unto Him: ‘If Thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. 16For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in Thy sight, I and Thy people? is it not in that Thou goest with us, so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?’
<br>17And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee by name.’ 18And he said: ‘Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory.’ 19And He said: ‘I will make all My goodness pass before
<br> 
<br>thee, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.’ 20And He said: ‘Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.’ 21And the LORD said: ‘Behold, there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock. 22And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by. 23And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen.’
<br>And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Hew thee two tables
<br>of stone like unto the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break. 2And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount. 3And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.’ 4And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. 5And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 6And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: ‘The LORD, the LORD,
<br> 
<br>God, merciful and gracious, long- suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; 7keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.’ 8And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 9And he said: ‘If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance.’ 10And He said: ‘Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous. 11Observe thou that which I am commanding thee this day; behold, I am driving out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 12Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. 13But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim. 14For thou shalt bow down to no other god; for the LORD,
<br> 
<br>whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God; 15lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and they call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice; 16and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. 17Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 18The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 19All that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males, the firstlings of ox and sheep. 20And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty. 21Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 22And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year. 23Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 24For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders; neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the
<br> 
<br>LORD thy God three times in the year. 25Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 26The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.’
<br>27And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.’ 28And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. 29And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth abeams while He talked with him. 30And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face sent forth beams; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 31And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him; and Moses spoke to them. 32And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33And when Moses had done speaking with
<br>
<br>a Heb. horns.
<br> 
<br>them, he put a veil on his face. 34But when Moses went in before the LORD that He might speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out; and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 35And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’face sent forth beams; and Moses put the veil back upon his face, until he went in to speak with Him.
<br>ויקהל
<br>And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of
<br>Israel, and said unto them: ‘These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. 2Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to the LORD; whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death. 3Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.’
<br>4And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: ‘This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying: 5Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD, whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, the LORD’S offering: gold, and silver, and brass; 6and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’hair; 7and rams’skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood; 8and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; 9and onyx stones, and stones
<br> 
<br>to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 10And let every wise- hearted man among you come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded: 11the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 12the ark, and the staves thereof, the ark-cover, and the veil of the screen; 13the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread; 14the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 15and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 16the altar of burnt- offering, with its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; 17the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 18the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; 19the plaited garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.’
<br>20And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 21And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and brought the LORD’S offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.
<br> 
<br>22And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing- hearted, and brought nose-rings, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and girdles, all jewels of gold; even every man that brought an offering of gold unto the LORD. 23And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’hair, and rams’skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them. 24Every one that did set apart an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD’S offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia-wood for any work of the service, brought it. 25And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 26And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’hair. 27And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 28and the spice, and the oil, for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 29The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto the LORD; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses to be made.
<br>30And Moses said unto the children of Israel: ‘See, the LORD hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 31And He hath filled him with the spirit of God,
<br> 
<br>in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship. 32And to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 33and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship. 34And He hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 35Them hath He filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the craftsman, and of the skilful workman, and of the weaver in colours, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works.
<br>And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted
<br>man, in whom the LORD hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD hath commanded.’
<br>2And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it. 3And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning. 4And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every
<br> 
<br>man from his work which they wrought. 5And they spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.’ 6And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying: ‘Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.’ So the people were restrained from bringing. 7For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
<br>8And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains: of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman made he them. 9The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had one measure. 10And he coupled five curtains one to another; and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 11And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain that was outmost in the first set; likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second set. 12Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one to another. 13And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps; so the tabernacle was one.
<br> 
<br>14And he made curtains of goats’hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he made them. 15The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain; the eleven curtains had one measure. 16And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 17And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the first set, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second set. 18And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 19And he made a covering for the tent of rams’skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
<br>20And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia-wood, standing up. 21Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. 22Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. Thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23And he made the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward. 24And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 25And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 26and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 27And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he
<br> 
<br>made six boards. 28And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part; 29that they might be double beneath, and in like manner they should be complete unto the top thereof unto the first ring. Thus he did to both of them in the two corners. 30And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets: under every board two sockets. 31And he made bars of acacia- wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 32and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. 33And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other. 34And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
<br>35And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with the cherubim the work of the skilful workman made he it. 36And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks being of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 37And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours; 38and the five pillars of it with their hooks; and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass.
<br> 
<br>And Bezalel made the ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a
<br>half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it. 2And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 3And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof: even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 4And he made staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold. 5And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 6And he made an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 7And he made two cherubim of gold: of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the ark-cover: 8one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof. 9And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover were the faces of the cherubim.
<br>10And he made the table of acacia- wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 11And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about. 12And he made unto it a border of a hand- breadth round about, and made a
<br> 
<br>golden crown to the border thereof round about. 13And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof. 14Close by the border were the rings, the holders for the staves to bear the table. 15And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 16And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the jars thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.
<br>17And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it. 18And there were six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof; 19three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower. So for the six branches going out of the candlestick. 20And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond- blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof; 21and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it. 22Their
<br> 
<br>knops and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 23And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold. 24Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.
<br>25And he made the altar of incense of acacia-wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, four-square; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it. 26And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it; and he made unto it a crown of gold round about. 27And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for holders for staves wherewith to bear it. 28And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with gold. 29And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.
<br>And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia-wood:
<br>five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, four- square, and three cubits the height thereof. 2And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it; and he overlaid it with brass. 3And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins,
<br> 
<br>the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass. 4And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up. 5And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be holders for the staves. 6And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and overlaid them with brass. 7And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.
<br>8And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
<br>9And he made the court; for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits. 10Their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 11And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 12And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
<br>and their fillets of silver. 13And for the
<br> 
<br>hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 16All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 17And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 18And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the weaver in colours, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 19And their pillars were four, and their sockets four of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver. 20And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.

<br>21These are the accounts of the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were rendered according to the commandment of Moses, through the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 22And Bezalel
<br>the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the L
<br> 
<br>east side eastward fifty cubits. 14The
<br>hangings for the one side [of the gate] were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 15And so for the other side; on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were
<br> 
<br>ORD
<br>commanded Moses. 23And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman, and a skilful workman, and a weaver in colours, in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.— 24All the gold
<br> 
<br>that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 25And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three-score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 26a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men. 27And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil: a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 28And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. 29And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 30And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar, 31and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
<br>And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made plaited
<br> 
<br>garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>2And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 3And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into threads, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman. 4They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together. 5And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece and like the work thereof: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>6And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel. 7And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses. 8And he made the breastplate,  the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 9It was four-square; they made the breastplate double; a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double. 10And they set in it four rows of stones: a row of carnelian, topaz, and smaragd was the first row. 11And the second row, a
<br> 
<br>carbuncle, a sapphire, and an emerald. 12And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst. 13And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were inclosed in fittings of gold in their settings. 14And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes. 15And they made upon the breastplate plaited chains, of wreathen work of pure gold. 16And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 17And they put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 18And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder- pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof. 19And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward. 20And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the  coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. 21And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from
<br> 
<br>the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>22And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; 23and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent. 24And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. 25And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates: 26a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>27And they made the tunics of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 28and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 29and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the weaver in colours; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>30And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: HOLY TO THE LORD. 31And they tied unto it a thread of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>32Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting; and the children of Israel did
<br> 
<br>according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
<br>33And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets; 34and the covering of rams’skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen; 35the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the ark-cover; 36the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread; 37the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light; 38and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent; 39the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; 40the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting; 41the plaited garments for ministering in the holy place; the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office. 42According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. 43And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it. And Moses blessed them.
<br> 
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:  2’On the first
<br>day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 3And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil. 4And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the bread that is upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 5And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 6And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 7And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 8And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. 9And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof; and it shall be holy. 10And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt- offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar; and the altar shall be most holy. 11And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it. 12And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. 13And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 14And thou shalt bring
<br> 
<br>his sons, and put tunics upon them. 15And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office; and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.’ 16Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
<br>17And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 18And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars. 19And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>20And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the ark-cover above upon the ark. 21And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>22And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. 23And he set a row of bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>24And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 25And he lighted the lamps
<br> 
<br>before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>26And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil; 27and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>28And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 29And the altar of burnt-offering he set at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>30And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash; 31that Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and their feet thereat; 32when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they should wash; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>33And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
<br>34Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 35And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.— 36And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys. 37But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not
<br> 
<br>till the day that it was taken up. 38For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire
<br> 
<br>therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.—
<br> 
<br>ויקרא
<br>LEVITICUS
<br> 
<br>And tHE LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent
<br>of meeting, saying: 2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When any man of you bringeth an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock.
<br>3If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD. 4And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 5And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. 6And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. 7And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire. 8And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; 9but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-
<br> 
<br>offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<br>10And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish. 11And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about. 12And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. 13But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<br>14And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. 15And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar. 16And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes. 17And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it
<br> 
<br>smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt- offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<br>And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon. 2And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof,	together	with	all	the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 3But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the
<br>offerings of the LORD made by fire.
<br>4And when thou bringest a meal- offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
<br>5And if thy offering be a meal- offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 6Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering.
<br>7And if thy offering be a meal- offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 8And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the LORD; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. 9And the priest shall take off
<br> 
<br>from the meal-offering the memorial- part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar—an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 10But that which is left of the meal- offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. 11No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 12As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the LORD; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar. 13And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.
<br>14And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the LORD, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first- fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear. 15And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal- offering. 16And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of
<br>the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before
<br> 
<br>the LORD. 2And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about. 3And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 4and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away hard by the kidneys. 5And Aaron’s sons shall make it smoke on the altar upon the burnt- offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<br>6And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 7If he bring a lamb for his offering, then shall he present it before the LORD. 8And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. 9And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which he shall take away hard by the rump- bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 10and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the
<br> 
<br>kidneys. 11And the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>12And if his offering be a goat, then he shall present it before the LORD. 13And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. 14And he shall present thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 15and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. 16And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is the LORD’S. 17It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto the children
<br>of Israel, saying:
<br>If any one shall sin through error, in any of the things which the LORD hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them: 3if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin-offering. 4And he shall bring
<br> 
<br>the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before the LORD. 5And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting. 6And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. 7And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the remaining blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. 8And all the fat of the bullock of the sin- offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 9and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by kidneys, 10as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar of burnt-offering. 11But the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, 12even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
<br> 
<br>13And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err, the thing being hid from the eyes of the assembly, and do any of the things which the LORD hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty: 14when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. 15And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD; and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 16And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting. 17And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil. 18And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tent of meeting, and all the remaining blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. 19And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and make it smoke upon the altar. 20Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. 21And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin-offering for the assembly.
<br>22When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things
<br> 
<br>which the LORD his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: 23if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish. 24And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the LORD; it is a sin-offering. 25And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt- offering. 26And all the fat thereof shall he make smoke upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
<br>27And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which the LORD hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty: 28if his sin, which he hath sinned, be known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. 29And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering. 30And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. 31And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as
<br> 
<br>the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
<br>32And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. 33And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering. 34And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin- offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt- offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. 35And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the LORD made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
<br>And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity; 2or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from him that he is unclean; 3or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his
<br> 
<br>uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty; 4or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty in one of these things; 5and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned; 6and he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin. 7And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his forfeit for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle- doves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD: one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. 8And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin- offering first, and pinch off its head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder. 9And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering. 10And he shall prepare the second for a burnt- offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
<br>11But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
<br> 
<br>then he shall bring his offering for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin- offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. 12And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the LORD made by fire; it is a sin- offering. 13And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven; and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as the meal-offering.
<br>14And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 15If any one commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-offering. 16And he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven.
<br>17And if any one sin, and do any of the things which the LORD hath commanded not to be done, though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 18And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
<br> 
<br>according to thy valuation, for a guilt- offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed, though he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven. 19It is a guilt- offering—he is certainly guilty before the LORD.
<br>20And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 21If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and deal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbour; 22or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein; 23then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, 24or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty. 25And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a guilt- offering, unto the priest. 26And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven, concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.
<br>צו
<br> 
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2 Command Aaron and his
<br>sons, saying:
<br>This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby. 3And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 4And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 5And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. 6Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
<br>7And this is the law of the meal- offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar. 8And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal- offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 9And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in
<br> 
<br>the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. 10It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering. 11Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the LORD made by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
<br>12And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 13This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. 14On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 15And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke unto the LORD. 16And every meal- offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten.
<br>17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 18Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying:
<br>This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy. 19The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the
<br> 
<br>court of the tent of meeting. 20Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. 21But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. 22Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy. 23And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire.
<br>And this is the law of the guilt- offering: it is most holy. 2In the place where they kill the burnt- offering shall they kill the guilt- offering: and the blood thereof shall be dashed against the altar round about. 3And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and  the  fat that covereth the inwards, 4and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. 5And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a guilt-offering. 6Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 7As is the sin- offering, so is the guilt-offering; there is one law for them; the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall
<br> 
<br>have it. 8And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered. 9And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest’s that offereth it. 10And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.
<br>11And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one may offer unto the LORD. 12If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. 13With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving. 14And of it he shall present one out of each offering for a gift unto the LORD; it shall be the priest’s that dasheth the blood of the peace-offerings against the altar. 15And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace- offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 16But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a freewill- offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it may be eaten. 17But that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice
<br> 
<br>on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 18And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it; it shall be an abhorred thing, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 19And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat thereof. 20But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people. 21And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, whether it be the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean detestable thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<br>22And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 23Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:
<br>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. 24And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 25For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. 26And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your
<br> 
<br>dwellings. 27Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<br>28And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 29Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:
<br>He that offereth his sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD shall bring his offering unto the LORD out of his sacrifice of peace-offerings. 30His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire: the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before the LORD. 31And the priest shall make the fat smoke upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. 32And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave- offering out of your sacrifices of peace-offerings. 33He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. 34For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving have I taken of the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace- offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel.
<br>35This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when they were presented to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office; 36which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that
<br> 
<br>they were anointed. It is a due for ever throughout their generations.
<br>37This is the law of the burnt- offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt- offering, and of the consecration- offering, and of the sacrifice of peace- offerings; 38which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 3and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.’ 4And Moses did as the LORD commanded him;	and	the	congregation	was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. 5And Moses said unto the congregation: ‘This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded to be done.’ 6And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 7And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. 8And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. 9And he set the mitre
<br> 
<br>upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses. 10And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. 11And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them. 12And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 13And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. 14And the bullock of the sin-offering was brought; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering. 15And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. 16And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it smoke upon the altar. 17But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. 18And the ram of the burnt- offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 19And when it was killed,
<br> 
<br>Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. 20And when the ram was cut into its pieces, Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke. 21And when the inwards and the legs were washed with water, Moses made the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 22And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 23And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 24And Aaron’s sons were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. 25And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh. 26And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh. 27And he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 28And Moses took them from off
<br> 
<br>their hands, and made them smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 29And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before the LORD; it was Moses’portion of the ram of consecration; as the LORD commanded Moses. 30And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’garments with him. 31And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: ‘Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 32And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 33And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days. 34As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you. 35And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for so I am commanded. 36And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
<br> 
<br>
<br>שמיני
<br>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and
<br>his sons, and the elders of Israel; 2and he said unto Aaron: ‘Take thee a bull- calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. 3And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin- offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; 4and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth unto you.’ 5And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 6And Moses said: ‘This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the LORD may appear unto you.’ 7And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt- offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.’ 8So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. 9And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the
<br> 
<br>horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. 10But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 11And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp. 12And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about. 13And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar. 14And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar. 15And the people’s offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. 16And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance. 17And the meal- offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt- offering of the morning. 18He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about, 19and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver. 20And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar. 21And the
<br> 
<br>breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. 22And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace- offerings. 23And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. 24And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
<br>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of
<br>them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them. 2And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. 3Then Moses said unto Aaron: ‘This is it that the LORD spoke, saying: Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’ And Aaron held his peace. 4And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.’ 5So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said. 6And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
<br> 
<br>sons: ‘Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tend your clothes, that ye die not, and that He be not wroth with all the congregation; but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. 7And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.’ And they did according to the word of Moses.
<br>
<br>8And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, saying: 9’Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 10And that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 11and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.’
<br>12And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: ‘Take the meal- offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy. 13And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’due, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire; for so I am commanded. 14And the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for
<br> 
<br>they are given as thy due, and thy sons’due, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel. 15The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’with thee, as a due for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.’
<br>16And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt; and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying: 17’Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin- offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and He hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 18Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within; ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.’ 19And Aaron spoke unto Moses: ‘Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before the LORD, and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had eaten the sin- offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of the LORD? 20And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
<br>
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying
<br>unto them: 2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:
<br> 
<br>These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 3Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat. 4Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. 5And the rock- badger, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. 6And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you 7And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. 8Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
<br>9These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat. 10And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are a detestable thing unto you, 11and they shall be a detestable thing unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in detestation. 12Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing unto you.
<br>13And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls; they shall
<br> 
<br>not be eaten, they are a detestable thing: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the ospray; 14and the kite, and the falcon after its kinds; 15every raven after its kinds; 16and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds; 17and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl; 18and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the carrion- vulture; 19and the stork, and the heron after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
<br>20All winged swarming things that go upon all fours are a detestable thing unto you. 21Yet these may ye eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, which have jointed legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth; 22even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kinds, and the bald locust after its kinds, and the cricket after its kinds, and the grasshopper after its kinds. 23But all winged swarming things, which have four feet, are a detestable thing unto you.
<br>24And by these ye shall become unclean; whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until even. 25And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 26Every beast which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven footed, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you; every one that to toucheth them shall be unclean. 27And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours,
<br> 
<br>they are unclean unto you; whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even. 28And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; they are unclean unto you.
<br>29And these are they which are unclean unto you among the swarming things that swarm upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds, 30and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. 31These are they which are unclean to you among all that swarm; whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even. 32And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean. 33And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break. 34All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink in every such vessel that may be drunk shall be unclean. 35And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. 36Nevertheless a fountain or a
<br> 
<br>cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean; but he who toucheth their carcass shall be unclean. 37And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean. 38But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.
<br>39And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die, he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even. 40And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
<br>41And every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten. 42Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all swarming things that swarm upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are a detestable thing. 43Ye shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarmeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 44For I am the LORD your God; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy; neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of swarming thing that moveth upon the earth. 45For I am the LORD that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
<br> 
<br>46This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that swarmeth upon the earth; 47to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.
<br>תזריע
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, saying:
<br>If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. 3And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 4And she shall continue in the blood of purification three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled. 5But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of purification threescore and six days. 6And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest. 7And he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that
<br> 
<br>beareth, whether a male or a female. 8And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle- doves, or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
<br>
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses	and	unto	Aaron,
<br>saying:
<br>2When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests. 3And the priest shall look upon the plague in the skin of the flesh; and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 4And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days. 5And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague stay in its appearance, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more. 6And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague
<br> 
<br>be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 7But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 8And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
<br>9When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest. 10And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising, 11it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up; for he is unclean. 12And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest; 13then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague; it is all turned white: he is clean. 14But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 15And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy. 16But if the raw flesh again be turned into white, then he shall come unto the priest; 17and the  priest shall look on
<br> 
<br>him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
<br>18And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed, 19and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish- white, then it shall be shown to the priest. 20And the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil. 21But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days. 22And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. 23But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<br>24Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white; 25then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 26But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in
<br> 
<br>the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days. 27And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day; if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 28And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim, it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burning.
<br>29And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard, 30then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. 31And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days. 32And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin, 33then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more. 34And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if
<br> 
<br>the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 35But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing, 36then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair: he is unclean. 37But if the scall stay in its appearance, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<br>38And if a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; 39then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin: he is clean.
<br>40And if a man’s hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. 41And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead- bald; yet is he clean. 42But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 43Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, 44he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean: his plague is in his head.
<br> 
<br>45And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry: ‘Unclean, unclean.’ 46All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.
<br>47And when the plague of leprosy is in a garment, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment; 48or in the warp, or in the woof, whether they be of linen, or of wool; or in a skin, or in any thing made of skin. 49If the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown unto the priest. 50And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days. 51And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for, the plague is a malignant leprosy: it is unclean. 52And he shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, whether it be of wool or of linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is; for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 53And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; 54then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is,
<br> 
<br>and he shall shut it up seven days more. 55And the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its colour, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without. 56And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof. 57And if it appear still in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, it is breaking out, thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. 58And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. 59This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
<br>מצרע
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<br>2This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest. 3And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 4then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
<br> 
<br>two living clean birds, and cedar- wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 5And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 6As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 7And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field. 8And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he may come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. 9And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. 10And on the eighth day he shall take two he- lambs without blemish, and one ewe- lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 11And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. 12And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a guilt-offering, and the
<br> 
<br>log of oil, and wave them for a wave- offering before the LORD. 13And he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt-offering; it is most holy. 14And the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 15And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. 16And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD. 17And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt-offering. 18And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD. 19And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt- offering. 20And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal- offering upon the altar; and the priest
<br> 
<br>shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
<br>21And if he be poor, and his means suffice not, then he shall take one he- lamb for a guilt-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil; 22and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt- offering. 23And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before the LORD. 24And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt- offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave- offering before the LORD. 25And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 26And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand. 27And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD. 28And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering. 29And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s
<br> 
<br>hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. 30And he shall offer one of the turtle- doves, or of the young pigeons, such as his means suffice for; 31even such as his means suffice for, the one for a sin- offering, and the other for a burnt- offering, with the meal-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. 32This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means suffice not for that which pertaineth to his cleansing.
<br>33And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:
<br>34When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 35then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying: ‘There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.’ 36And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house. 37And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall; 38then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 39And the priest shall come again the seventh
<br> 
<br>day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 40then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city. 41And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place. 42And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. 43And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that the stones have been taken out, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it is plastered; 44then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 45And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 46Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 47And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 48And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 49And he shall
<br> 
<br>take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 50And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 51And he shall take the cedar- wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 52And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar-wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet. 53But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field; so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.
<br>54This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall; 55and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house; 56and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot; 57to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean; this is the law of leprosy.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying:
<br>2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, his issue is unclean. 3And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 4Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and every thing whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
<br> 
<br>5And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 6And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 7And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 8And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 9And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean. 10And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even; and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 11And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 12And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 13And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 14And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come
<br> 
<br>before the LORD unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest. 15And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.
<br>16And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 17And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the flow of seed, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 18The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.
<br>19And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days; and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. 20And every thing that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean; every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 21And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 22And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 23And if he be on the bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. 24And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
<br> 
<br>25And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean. 26Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity; and every thing whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity. 27And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 28But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 29And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. 30And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.
<br>31Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My tabernacle that is in the midst of them.
<br>32This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him from whom the flow of seed goeth out, so that he is unclean thereby; 33and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of them that have an
<br> 
<br>issue, whether it be a man, or a woman; and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
<br>אחרי מות
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, after the death of the
<br>two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD, and died; 2and the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the ark-cover which is upon the ark; that he die not; for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover. 3Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt- offering. 4He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired; they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on. 5And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering. 6And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house. 7And he shall take the two goats, and set them before the LORD at the door of the tent of meeting. 8And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel. 9And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell
<br> 
<br>for the LORD, and offer him for a sin- offering. 10But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before the LORD, to make atonement over him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness. 11And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself. 12And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil. 13And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not. 14And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the ark-cover on the east; and before the ark-cover shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 15Then shall he kill the goat of the sin- offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the ark-cover, and before the ark-cover. 16And he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. 17And there shall be no
<br> 
<br>man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. 18And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. 19And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel. 20And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat. 21And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of an appointed man into the wilderness. 22And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land which is cut off; and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 23And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there. 24And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place and put on his other vestments, and come forth, and offer his burnt- offering and the burnt-offering of the
<br> 
<br>people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. 25And the fat of the sin-offering shall he make smoke upon the altar. 26And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 27And the bullock of the sin- offering, and the goat of the sin- offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 28And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
<br>29And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you. 30For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the LORD. 31It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever. 32And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments. 33And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for
<br> 
<br>all the people of the assembly. 34And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year.’ And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying:
<br>3What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, 4and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to present it as an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people. 5To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto the LORD. 6And the priest shall dash the blood against the altar of the LORD at the door of the tent of meeting, and make the fat smoke for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 7And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.
<br> 
<br>8And thou shalt say unto them: Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice, 9and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto the LORD, even that man shall be cut off from his people.
<br>10And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 11For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. 12Therefore I said unto the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 13And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that taketh in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. 14For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof; therefore I said unto the children of Israel: Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 15And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he
<br> 
<br>be home-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even; then shall he be clean. 16But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>I am the LORD your God. 3After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes. 4Mine ordinances shall ye do, and My statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 5Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the LORD.
<br>6None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness. I am the LORD.
<br>7The nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<br>8The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.
<br>9The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
<br> 
<br>10The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness.
<br>11The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<br>12Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.
<br>13Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister; for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.
<br>14Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
<br>15Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son’wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<br>16Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness. 17Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they are near kinswomen; it is lewdness. 18And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her lifetime. 19And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. 20And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy
<br> 
<br>neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with her. 21And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 22Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination. 23And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion.
<br>24Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you. 25And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomited out her inhabitants. 26Ye therefore shall keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you— 27for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled— 28that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 29For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. 30Therefore shall ye keep My charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.
<br>קדשים
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto all
<br> 
<br>the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>Ye shall be holy; for I the LORD your God am holy. 3Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep My sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. 4Turn ye not unto the idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.
<br>5And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted. 6It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. 7And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it shall not be accepted. 8But every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<br>9And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. 10And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 11Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. 12And ye shall not swear by My name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 13Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the
<br> 
<br>morning. 14Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 15Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor favour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 16Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD. 17Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. 19Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed; neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. 20And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 21And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt-offering. 22And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned; and
<br> 
<br>he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned.
<br>23And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be eaten. 24And in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD. 25But in the fifth year may ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. 26Ye shall not eat with the blood; neither shall ye practise divination nor soothsaying. 27Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 28Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 29Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness. 30Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD. 31Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 32Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 33And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. 34The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
<br> 
<br>strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 35Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 36Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 37And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them: I am the LORD.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses,    saying:    2Moreover,
<br>thou shalt say to the children of Israel: Whosoever he be of the children of
<br>Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 3I also will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile My sanctuary, and to profane My holy name. 4And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death; 5then I will set My face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech, from among their people. 6And the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits, to go astray after them, I will even set My face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 7Sanctify yourselves therefore,
<br> 
<br>and be ye holy; for I am the LORD your God. 8And keep ye My statutes, and do them: I am the LORD who sanctify you. 9For whatsoever man there be that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. 10And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 11And the man that lieth with his father’s wife— he hath uncovered his father’s nakedness—both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 12And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have wrought corruption; their blood shall be upon them. 13And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 14And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 15And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast. 16And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 17And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s
<br> 
<br>daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness: it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 18And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness—he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood—both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 19And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister; for he hath made naked his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity. 20And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife—he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness— they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 21And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
<br>22Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. 23And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 24But I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ I am the LORD your God, who have set you apart from the peoples. 25Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and
<br> 
<br>the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and ye shall not make your souls detestable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean. 26And ye shall be holy unto Me; for I the LORD am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine.
<br>27A man also or a woman that divineth by a ghost or a familiar spirit, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
<br>אמר
<br>And the LORD said unto Moses: Speak unto the priests
<br>the sons of Aaron, and say unto them:
<br>There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people; 2except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother; 3and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself. 4He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. 5They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 6They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer; therefore they shall be holy. 7They shall not take a woman
<br> 
<br>that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God. 8Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God; he shall be holy unto thee; for I the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy. 9And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
<br>10And the priest that is highest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; 11neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 12neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD. 13And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 14A widow, or one divorced, or a profaned woman, or a harlot, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. 15And he shall not profane his seed among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctify him.
<br>16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 17Speak unto Aaron, saying:
<br>Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. 18For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind
<br> 
<br>man, or a lame, or he that hath any thing maimed, or anything too long, 19or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, 20or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath his eye overspread, or is scabbed, or scurvy, or hath his stones crushed; 21no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire; he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 22He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 23Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not My holy places; for I am the LORD who sanctify them.
<br>24So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto Me, and that they profane not My holy name: I am the LORD. 3Say unto them:
<br>Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me: I am the LORD. 4What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue, he shall not eat
<br> 
<br>of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any one that is unclean by the dead; or from whomsoever the flow of seed goeth out; 5or whosoever toucheth any swarming thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 6the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. 7And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. 8That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD. 9They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctify them. 10There shall no acommon man eat of the holy thing; a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 11But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they may eat of his bread. 12And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a common man, she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things. 13But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread; but there shall no common man
<br>
<br>a That is, one who is not a priest.
<br> 
<br>eat thereof. 14And if a man eat of the holy thing through error, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. 15And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the LORD; 16and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things; for I am the LORD who sanctify them.
<br>17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 18Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that bringeth his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will- offerings, which are brought unto the LORD for a burnt-offering; 19that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 20But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not bring; for it shall not be acceptable for you. 21And whosoever bringeth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for a freewill- offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. 22Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scabbed, or scurvy, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 23Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing too long or
<br> 
<br>too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 24That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the LORD; neither shall ye do thus in your land. 25Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you.
<br>26And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<br>27When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; but from the eighth day and thenceforth it may be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 28And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. 29And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. 30On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the LORD. 31And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am the LORD. 32And ye shall not profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD who hallow you, 33that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
<br>
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br> 
<br>The appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons. 3Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings.
<br>4These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. 5In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the LORD’S passover. 6And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. 7In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 8And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<br>9And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying: 10Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. 11And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 12And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-
<br> 
<br>offering unto the LORD. 13And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. 14And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<br>15And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the aday of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete; 16even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto the LORD. 17Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first- fruits unto the LORD. 18And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto the LORD, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 19And ye shall offer one he- goat for a sin-offering, and two he- lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings. 20And the priest shall
<br>
<br>a Heb. sabbath.
<br> 
<br>wave them with the bread of the first- fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 21And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<br>22And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
<br>23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 24Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:
<br>In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation. 25Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<br>26And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<br>27Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 28And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God. 29For
<br> 
<br>whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. 30And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. 31Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 32It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
<br>33And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 34Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:
<br>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 35On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. 36Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<br>37These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; 38beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all
<br> 
<br>your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
<br>39Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD   seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. 40And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 41And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month. 42Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home- born in Israel shall dwell in booths; 43that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<br>44And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the LORD.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses,   saying:   2’Command
<br>the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 3Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a statute for ever throughout
<br> 
<br>your generations. 4He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
<br>5And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake. 6And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 7And thou shalt put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial- part, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 8Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. 9And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, a perpetual due.’
<br>
<br>10And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. 11And the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 12And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of the LORD.
<br>13And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 14’Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
<br> 
<br>that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 15And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 16And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death. 17And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death. 18And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life. 19And if a man maim his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: 20breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. 21And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. 22Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the home-born; for I am the LORD your God.’ 23And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>בהר
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying:
<br>2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a
<br> 
<br>sabbath unto the LORD. 3Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the produce thereof. 4But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto the LORD; thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 5That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather; it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. 6And the sabbath-produce of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for the settler by thy side that sojourn with thee; 7and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
<br>8And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. 9Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye make proclamation with the horn throughout all your land. 10And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 11A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not sow, neither reap that which
<br> 
<br>groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines. 12For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. 13In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. 14And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another. 15According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee. 16According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of crops doth he sell unto thee. 17And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God; for I am the LORD your God. 18Wherefore ye shall do My statutes, and keep Mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 19And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye have enough, and dwell therein in safety. 20And if ye shall say: ‘What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase’; 21then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. 22And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store. 23And the land shall not be sold
<br> 
<br>in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and settlers with Me. 24And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
<br>25If thy brother be waxen poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. 26And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find sufficient means to redeem it; 27then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession. 28But if he have not sufficient means to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
<br>29And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. 30And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee. 31But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee. 32But as for the cities
<br> 
<br>of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption. 33And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 34But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold; for that is their perpetual possession.
<br>35And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his means fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a settler shall he live with thee. 36Take thou no interest of him or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. 37Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase. 38I am the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.
<br>39And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee, thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant. 40As a hired servant, and as a settler, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee. 41Then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. 42For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondmen. 43Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
<br> 
<br>God. 44And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou mayest have: of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 45Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they may be your possession. 46And ye may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession: of them may ye take your bondmen for ever; but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour.
<br>47And if a stranger who is a settler with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger who is a settler with thee, or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family, 48after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him; 49or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself. 50And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. 51If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he
<br> 
<br>was bought for. 52And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. 53As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him; he shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 54And if he be not redeemed by any of these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. 55For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<br>Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a
<br>graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am the LORD your God. 2Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.
<br>בחקתי
<br>3If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them; 4then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 5And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough, and dwell in your land safely. 6And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the
<br> 
<br>land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 7And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 8And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 9And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish My covenant with you. 10And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new. 11And I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you. 12And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be My people. 13I am the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
<br>
<br>14But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments; 15and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant; 16I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail, and the soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 17And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies; they that hate you shall rule
<br> 
<br>over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 18And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 19And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass. 20And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her produce, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. 21And if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will not hearken unto Me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 22And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. 23And if in spite of these things ye will not be corrected unto Me, but will walk contrary unto Me; 24then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. 25And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 26When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
<br>27And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me; 28then I will walk contrary
<br> 
<br>unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 29And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 30And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun- pillars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you. 31And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 32And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 33And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. 34Then shall the land be paid her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’land; even then shall the land rest, and repay her sabbaths. 35As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 36And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 37And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 38And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of
<br> 
<br>your enemies shall eat you up. 39And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 40And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their treachery which they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary unto Me. 41I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity; 42then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 43For the land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected Mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes. 44And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. 45But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
<br> 
<br>46These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the LORD made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons unto the LORD, according to thy valuation, 3then thy valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 4And if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels. 5And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 6And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 7And if it be from sixty years old and upward: if it be a male, then thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 8But if he be too poor for thy valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him that vowed shall the priest value him.
<br>9And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all
<br> 
<br>that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 10He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. 11And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest. 12And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be. 13But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy valuation.
<br>14And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand. 15And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.
<br>16And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing thereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 17If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand. 18But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy valuation. 19And if he that sanctified the field will
<br> 
<br>indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 20And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 21But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s. 22And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession; 23then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD. 24In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. 25And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
<br>26Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a firstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the LORD’S. 27And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation.
<br>28Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his
<br> 
<br>possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD. 29None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
<br>30And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S; it is holy unto the LORD. 31And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. 32And
<br> 
<br>all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 33He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
<br>34These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

<br> 
<br>AND THE LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
<br>tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after the were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: 2’Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’houses, according to the number of names, every male, by their polls; 3from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: ye shall number them by their hosts, even thou and Aaron. 4And with you there shall be a man of every tribe, every one head of his fathers’house. 5And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur. 6Of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 7Of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 8Of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar. 9Of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon. 10Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 11Of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni. 12Of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 13Of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran. 14Of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 15Of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.’ 16These    were    the    elect    of    the
<br> 
<br>congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel. 17And Moses and Aaron took these men that are pointed out by name. 18And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers’houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. 19As the LORD commanded Moses, so did he number them in the wilderness of Sinai.

<br> 
<br>32Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 33those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.

<br>44These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men; they were each one for his fathers’house. 45And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; 46even all those that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 47But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
<br>48And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 49’Howbeit the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel; 50but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to
<br> 
<br>it; they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 51And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death. 52And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man with his own camp, and every man with his own standard, according to their hosts. 53But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.’ 54Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 2’The children of Israel shall pitch by their fathers’houses; every man with his own	standard,	according	to	the ensigns; a good way off shall they pitch round about the tent of meeting. 3Now those that pitch on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Judah being Nahshon the son of Amminadab, 4and his host, and those that were numbered of them, threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred; 5and those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar;
<br> 
<br>the prince of the children of Issachar being Nethanel the son of Zuar, 6and his host, even those that were numbered thereof, fifty and four thousand and four hundred; 7and the tribe of Zebulun; the prince of the children of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon, 8and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, fifty and seven thousand and four hundred; 9all that were numbered of the camp of Judah being a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts; they shall set forth first.
<br>10On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Reuben being Elizur the son of Shedeur, 11and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, forty and six thousand and five hundred; 12and those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon; the prince of the children of Simeon being Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, 13and his host, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and nine thousand and three hundred; 14and the tribe of Gad; the prince of the children of Gad being Eliasaph the son of Reuel, 15and his host, even those that were numbered of them, forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty; 16all that were numbered of the camp of Reuben being a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according
<br> 
<br>to their hosts; and they shall set forth second.
<br>17Then the tent of meeting, with the camp of the Levites, shall set forward in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards.
<br>18On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud, 19and his host, and those that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred; 20and next unto him shall be the tribe of Manasseh; the prince of the children of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, 21and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and two hundred; 22and the tribe of Benjamin; the prince of the children of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni, 23and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and five thousand and four hundred; 24all that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim being a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to their hosts; and they shall set forth third.
<br>25On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their hosts; the prince of the children of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, 26and his host, and those that were numbered of them, threescore and two thousand and seven hundred; 27and those that pitch next
<br> 
<br>unto him shall be the tribe of Asher; the prince of the children of Asher being Pagiel the son of Ochran, 28and his host, and those that were numbered of them, forty and one thousand and five hundred; 29and the tribe of Naphtali; the prince of the children of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan, 30and his host, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and three thousand and four hundred; 31all that were numbered of the camp of Dan being a hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred; they shall set forth hindmost by their standards.’
<br>32These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’houses; all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 33But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 34Thus did the children of Israel: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, each one according to its families, and according to its fathers’houses.
<br>Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that
<br>the LORD spoke with Moses in mount Sinai. 2And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed,
<br> 
<br>whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. 4And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.
<br>5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 6’Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. 7And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. 8And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 9And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto him from the children of Israel. 10And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, that they may keep their priesthood; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.’
<br>11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 12’And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine; 13for all the first-born are Mine: on the day that I smote all the first- born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast, Mine they shall be: I am the LORD.’
<br> 
<br>14And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying: 15’Number the children of Levi by their fathers’houses, by their families; every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.’ 16And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded. 17And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 18And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. 19And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. 20And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers’houses.
<br>21Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites; these are the families of the Gershonites. 22Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. 23The families of the Gershonites were to pitch behind the tabernacle westward; 24the prince of the fathers’house of the Gershonites being Eliasaph the son of Lael, 25and the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting the tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting, 26and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the
<br> 
<br>door of the court—which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar, round about—and the cords of it, even whatsoever pertaineth to the service thereof.
<br>27And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these are the families of the Kohathites: 28according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, eight thousand and six hundred, keepers of the charge of the sanctuary. 29The families of the sons of Kohath were to pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward; 30the prince of the fathers’house of the families of the Kohathites being Elizaphan the son of Uzziel, 31and their charge the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith the priests minister, and the screen, and all that pertaineth to the service thereof; 32Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest being prince of the princes of the Levites, and having the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.
<br>33Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites; these are the families of Merari. 34And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred; 35the prince of the fathers’house of the families of Merari being Zuriel the son of Abihail; they
<br> 
<br>were to pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward; 36the appointed charge of the sons of Merari being the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments thereof, and all that pertaineth to the service thereof; 37and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 38And those that were to pitch before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising, were Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary, even the charge for the children of Israel; and the common man that drew nigh was to be put to death. 39All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.
<br>40And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 41And thou shalt take the Levites for Me, even the LORD, instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.’ 42And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel. 43And all the first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old
<br> 
<br>and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.
<br>44And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 45’Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine, even the LORD’S. 46And as for the redemption of the two hundred and three score and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above the number of the Levites, 47thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them—the shekel is twenty gerahs. 48And thou shalt give the money wherewith they that remain over of them are redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons.’ 49And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites; 50from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money: a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 51And Moses gave the redemption-money unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 2’Take
<br>the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’houses, 3from
<br> 
<br>thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do work in the tent of meeting. 4This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, about the most holy things: 5when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; 6and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall set the staves thereof. 7And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the pans, and the bowls, and the jars wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall remain thereon. 8And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall set the staves thereof. 9And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its tongs, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it. 10And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it upon a bar. 11And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall set the staves thereof. 12And they shall take all the vessels of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put
<br> 
<br>them on a bar. 13And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon. 14And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, the fire-pans, the flesh-hooks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of sealskin, and set the staves thereof. 15And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the holy furniture, and all the holy vessels, as the camp is to set forward—after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting. 16And the charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the continual meal- offering, and the anointing oil: he shall have the charge of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, whether it be the sanctuary, or the furniture thereof.’ 17And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 18’Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites; 19but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden; 20but they shall not go in to see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die.’
<br> 
<br>
<br>נשא
<br>21And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying: 22’Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’houses, by their families; 23from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them: all that enter in to wait upon the service, to do service in the tent of meeting. 24This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens: 25they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting; 26and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever there may be to do with them, therein shall they serve. 27At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden. 28This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting; and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
<br>29As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers’houses; 30from thirty
<br> 
<br>years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting. 31And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof; 32and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, even all their appurtenance, and all that pertaineth to their service; and by name ye shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden. 33This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.’
<br>34And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers’houses, 35from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for service in the tent of meeting. 36And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 37These are they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, of all that did serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<br> 
<br>38And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families, and by their fathers’houses, 39from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for service in the tent of meeting, 40even those that were numbered of them, by their families, by their fathers’houses, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 41These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all that did serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD.
<br>42And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers’houses, 43from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for service in the tent of meeting, 44even those that were numbered of them by their families, were three thousand and two hundred. 45These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<br>46All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families, and by their fathers’houses, 47from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered in to do the work of service, and the work of
<br> 
<br>bearing burdens in the tent of meeting, 48even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. 49According to the commandment of the LORD they were appointed by the hand of Moses, every one to his service, and to his burden; they were also numbered, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Command the children
<br>of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead; 3both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.’ 4And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as the LORD spoke unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 6Speak unto the children of Israel:
<br>When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the LORD, and that soul be guilty; 7then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty. 8But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for
<br> 
<br>guilt which is made shall be the LORD’S, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him. 9And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his. 10And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
<br>
<br>11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 12Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>If any man’s wife go aside, and act unfaithfully against him, 13and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, she being defiled secretly, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken in the act; 14and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled; 15then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal- offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 16And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD. 17And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put
<br> 
<br>it into the water. 18And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal- offering of jealousy; and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse. 19And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman: ‘If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse; 20but if thou hast gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband— 21then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman—the LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell; 22and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away’; and the woman shall say: ‘Amen, Amen.’ 23And the priest shall write these curses in a scroll, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness. 24And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter. 25And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the
<br> 
<br>meal-offering before the LORD, and bring it unto the altar. 26And the priest shall take a handful of the meal- offering, as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. 27And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have acted unfaithfully against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away; and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 28And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed. 29This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled; 30or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he be jealous over his wife; then shall he set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. 31And the man shall be clear from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto the children
<br>of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to consecrate himself unto the LORD, 3he shall abstain from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor
<br> 
<br>of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. 4All the days of his Naziriteship shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the pressed grapes even to the grapestone. 5All the days of his vow of Naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, in which he consecrateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. 6All the days that he consecrateth himself unto the LORD he shall not come near to a dead body. 7He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his consecration unto God is upon his head. 8All the days of his Naziriteship he is holy unto the LORD. 9And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 10And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. 11And the priest shall prepare one for a sin- offering, and the other for a burnt- offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead; and he shall hallow his head that same day. 12And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his Naziriteship, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year for a guilt-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his consecration was defiled.
<br> 
<br>13And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall abring it unto the door of the tent of meeting; 14and he shall present his offering unto the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace- offerings, 15and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings. 16And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt- offering. 17And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. 18And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace- offerings. 19And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is sodden, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven his consecrated head. 20And the
<br>
<br>a That is, bring his consecrated head (come with his consecrated hair unshaven).
<br> 
<br>priest shall wave them for a wave- offering before the LORD; this is holy for the priest, together with the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving; and after that the Nazirite may drink wine. 21This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his offering unto the LORD for his Naziriteship, beside that for which his means suffice; according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his Naziriteship.
<br>
<br>22And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 23’Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them:
<br>24The LORD bless thee, and keep thee;
<br>25The LORD make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;
<br>26The LORD lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
<br>27So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.’
<br>
<br>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them; 2that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’houses, offered—these were the princes of the tribes, these are they that	were	over	them	that	were
<br> 
<br>numbered. 3And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen: a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 5’Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.’ 6And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 7Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service. 8And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 9But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the holy things belonged unto them: they bore them upon their shoulders. 10And the princes brought the dedication-offering of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes brought their offering before the altar. 11And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘They shall present their offering each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.’
<br>12And he that presented his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah; 13and his offering was one silver dish, the weight thereof was a hundred and thirty shekels, one silver basin of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine

<br> 
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Speak unto Aaron, and
<br>say unto him: When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.’ 3And Aaron did so: he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. 4And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work; according unto the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the candlestick.
<br>5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 6’Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 7And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. 8Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. 9And thou shalt present the Levites before the
<br> 
<br>tent of meeting; and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. 10And thou shalt present the Levites before the LORD; and the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites. 11And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for a wave-offering from the children of Israel, that they may be to do the service of the LORD. 12And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks; and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites. 13And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto the LORD. 14Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine. 15And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering. 16For they are wholly given unto Me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto Me. 17For all the first- born among the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself. 18And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel. 19And I have given the Levites— they are given to Aaron and to his sons from among the
<br> 
<br>children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel, through the children of Israel coming nigh unto the sanctuary.’ 20Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites; according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 21And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a sacred gift before the LORD; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. 22And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons; as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
<br>23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 24’This is that which pertaineth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the tent of meeting; 25and from the age of fifty years they shall return from the service of the work, and shall serve no more; 26but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall do no manner of service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.’
<br> 
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
<br>first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: 2’Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. 3In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.’ 4And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 5And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 6But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. 7And those men said unto him: ‘We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?’ 8And Moses said unto them: ‘Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.’
<br>9And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 10’Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
<br> 
<br>passover unto the LORD; 11in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; 12they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. 13But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 14And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD: according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.’
<br>
<br>15And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. 16So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. 17And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. 18At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they
<br> 
<br>encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. 19And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 20And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 21And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 22Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 23At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Make thee
<br>two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to set forward. 3And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves
<br> 
<br>unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting. 4And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. 5And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey. 6And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 7But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 8And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations. 9And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 10Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.’
<br>
<br>11And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. 12And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai;
<br> 
<br>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.—13And they took their first journey, according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 14And in the first place the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 15And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 16And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 17And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, set forward. 18And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 19And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 20And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 21And the Kohathites the bearers of the sanctuary set forward, that the tabernacle might be set up against their coming. 22And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. 23And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 24And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. 25And the standard of the camp of the children of
<br> 
<br>Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 26And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 27And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 28Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts.—And they set forward.
<br>29And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’father-in-law: ‘We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said: I will give it you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.’ 30And he said unto him: ‘I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.’ 31And he said: ‘Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. 32And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the LORD   shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.’
<br>33And they set forward from the mount of the LORD three days’journey; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days’journey, to seek out a resting-place for them. 34And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.
<br>35And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: ‘Rise up,
<br> 
<br>O LORD, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee.’ 36And when it rested, he said: ‘Return, O LORD, unto the ten thousands of the families of Israel.’
<br>And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in
<br>the ears of the LORD; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. 2And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the LORD, and the fire abated. 3And the name of that place was called aTaberah, because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
<br>4And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: ‘Would that we were given flesh to eat! 5We remember the fish, which we were wont to eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; 6but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all; we have nought save this manna to look to.’—7Now the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. 8The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with
<br>
<br>a That is, Burning.
<br> 
<br>oil. 9And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.—10And Moses heard the people weeping, family by family, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. 11And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘Wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with Thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 12Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that Thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou didst swear unto their fathers? 13Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they trouble me with their weeping, saying: Give us flesh, that we may eat. 14I am not able to bear all this people myself alone, because it is too heavy for me. 15And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in Thy sight; and let me not look upon my wretchedness.’
<br>16And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. 17And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the
<br> 
<br>people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 18And say thou unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against to- morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying: Would that we were given flesh to eat! for it was well with us in Egypt; therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 19Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 20but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected the LORD who is among you, and have troubled Him with weeping, saying: Why, now, came we forth out of Egypt?’ 21And Moses said: ‘The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and yet Thou hast said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month! 22If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them? or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, will they suffice them?’ 23And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not.’
<br>24And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. 25And the LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders; and
<br> 
<br>it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. 26But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were recorded, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. 27And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said: ‘Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.’ 28And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: ‘My lord Moses, shut them in.’ 29And Moses said unto him: ‘Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all the LORD’S people were prophets, that the LORD would put His spirit upon them! ’ 30And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
<br>31And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought across quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. 32And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps; and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 33While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
<br> 
<br>people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 34And the name of that place was called Kibroth- hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted. 35From aKibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
<br>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. 2And they said: ‘Hath the LORD indeed spoken only with Moses? hath He not spoken also with us?’ And the LORD heard it.— 3Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.— 4And the LORD spoke suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam: ‘Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting.’ And they three came out. 5And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the	Tent,	and	called	Aaron	and Miriam; and they both came forth. 6And He said: ‘Hear now My words: if there be a prophet among you, I the LORD do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream. 7My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house; 8with him do I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD doth he behold; wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant,
<br>
<br>a That is, The graves of lust.
<br> 
<br>against Moses?’ 9And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and He departed. 10And when the cloud was removed from over the Tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam; and, behold, she was leprous. 11And Aaron said unto Moses: ‘Oh my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned. 12Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.’ 13And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying: ‘Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee.’
<br>14And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.’ 15And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. 16And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.
<br>שלח
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Send thou
<br>men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.’ 3And Moses sent them from     the     wilderness     of     Paran
<br> 
<br>according to the commandment of the LORD; all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel. 4And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 5Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 6Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 7Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 8Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. 9Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 10Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 11Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 12Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 13Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 14Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 15Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 16These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. 17And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them: ‘Get you up here into the South, and go up into the mountains; 18and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; 19and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; 20and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of
<br> 
<br>the land.’—Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.— 21So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, at the entrance to Hamath. 22And they went up into the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.—Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.— 23And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a pole between two; they took also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.— 24That place was called the valley of aEshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.— 25And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 26And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 27And they told him, and said: ‘We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. 28Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified, and very great; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 29Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South; and the Hittite, and
<br>
<br>a That is, a cluster.
<br> 
<br>the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.’ 30And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and said: ‘We should go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.’ 31But the men that went up with him said: ‘We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.’ 32And they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying: ‘The land, through which we have passed to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. 33And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.’
<br>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
<br>the people wept that night. 2And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them: ‘Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! 3And wherefore doth the LORD bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey; were it not better for us to return into Egypt?’ 4And they said one to another: ‘Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.’ 5Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the
<br> 
<br>congregation of the children of Israel. 6And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes. 7And they spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: ‘The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. 8If the LORD delight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it unto us—a land which floweth with milk and honey. 9Only rebel not against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us; their defence is removed from over them, and the LORD is with us; fear them not.’ 10But all the congregation bade stone them with stones, when the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.
<br>11And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘How long will this people despise Me? and how long will they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them? 12I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.’ 13And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘When the Egyptians shall hear—for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy might from among them—14they will say to the inhabitants of this land, who have heard that Thou LORD art in the midst of this people; inasmuch as Thou LORD art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them, and Thou goest before them, in a pillar of
<br> 
<br>cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night; 15now if Thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of Thee will speak, saying: 16Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore unto them, therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness. 17And now, I pray Thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as Thou hast spoken, saying: 18The LORD is slow to anger, and plenteous in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. 19Pardon, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of Thy lovingkindness, and according as Thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.’ 20And the LORD said: ‘I have pardoned according to thy word’21But in very deed, as I live—and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD— 22surely all those men that have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to proof these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice; 23surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised Me see it. 24But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into  the land
<br> 
<br>whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 25Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the Vale; tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’ 26And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 27’How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that keep murmuring against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they keep murmuring against Me. 28Say unto them: As I live, saith the LORD, surely as ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to you: 29your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, ye that have murmured against Me; 30surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 31But your little ones, that ye said would be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected. 32But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. 33And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear	your		strayings,	until	your carcasses	be	consumed	in			the wilderness. 34After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years,		and		ye		shall	know		My displeasure. 35I the LORD have spoken,
<br> 
<br>surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against Me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.’ 36And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who, when they returned, made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, 37even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 38But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land. 39And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel; and the people mourned greatly. 40And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up to the top of the mountain, saying: ‘Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised; for we have sinned.’ 41And Moses said: ‘Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD, seeing it shall not prosper? 42Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies. 43For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; forasmuch as ye are turned back from following the LORD, and the LORD will not be with you.’ 44But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain; nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 45Then the Amalekite and the Canaanite, who
<br> 
<br>dwelt in that hill-country, came down, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.
<br>
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 3and will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a freewill-offering, or in your appointed seasons, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock; 4then shall he that bringeth his offering present unto the LORD a meal-offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil; 5and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 6Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil; 7and for the drink-offering thou shalt present the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 8And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for peace-offerings unto the LORD; 9then shall there be presented with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil. 10And thou shalt
<br> 
<br>present for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 11Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids. 12According to the number that ye may prepare, so shall ye do for every one according to their number. 13All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 14And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you, throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. 15As for the congregation, there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 16One law and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
<br>
<br>17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 18Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
<br>When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 19then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto the LORD. 20Of the first of your dough ye shall set apart a cake for a gift; as that which is set apart of the threshing-floor, so shall ye set it apart.
<br> 
<br>21Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD a portion for a gift throughout your generations.
<br>
<br>22And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 23even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; 24then it shall be, if it be done in error by the congregation, it being hid from their eyes, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt- offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD—with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance—and one he-goat for a sin-offering. 25And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their error. 26And all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done in error.
<br>27And if one person sin through error, then he shall offer a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering. 28And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth through error, before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and he shall
<br> 
<br>be forgiven, 29both he that is home- born among the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them: ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught in error. 30But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 31Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him.
<br>
<br>32And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. 33And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 34And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. 35And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.’ 36And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<br>37And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 38’Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments, and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue.
<br> 
<br>39And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; 40that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God. 41I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.’
<br>קרח
<br>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
<br>Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men; 2and they rose up in face of Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty men; they were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown; 3and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?’ 4And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. 5And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: ‘In the morning the LORD will show who are His, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He may choose will He cause to come near unto Him.
<br> 
<br>6This do: take you censors, Korah, and all his company; 7and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the LORD to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy; ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.’ 8And Moses said unto Korah: ‘Hear now, ye sons of Levi: 9is it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them; 10and that He hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and will ye seek the priesthood also? 11Therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the LORD—; and as to Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?’ 12And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said: ‘We will not come up; 13is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us? 14Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards; wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.’ 15And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD: ‘Respect not thou their offering; I have not taken one ass from them, neither
<br> 
<br>have I hurt one of them.’ 16And Moses said unto Korah: ‘Be thou and all thy congregation before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow; 17and take ye every man his fire-pan, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his fire- pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; thou also, and Aaron, each his fire- pan.’ 18And they took every man his fire-pan, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron. 19And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
<br>20And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 21’Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.’ 22And they fell upon their faces, and said: ‘O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?’
<br>23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 24’Speak unto the congregation, saying: Get you up from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ 25And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 26And he spoke unto the congregation, saying: ‘Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be swept away in all their sins.’ 27So they got them up from
<br> 
<br>the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. 28And Moses said: ‘Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works, and that I have not done them of mine own mind. 29If these men die the common death of all men, and be visited after the visitation of all men, then the LORD hath not sent Me. 30But if the LORD make a new thing, and the ground open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have despised the LORD.’ 31And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them. 32And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. 33So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit; and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly. 34And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said: ‘Lest the earth swallow us up.’ 35And fire came forth from the LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2‘Speak unto
<br> 
<br>Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are become holy; 3even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar—for they are become holy, because they were offered before the LORD—that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.’ 4And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, 5to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn incense before the LORD; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; as the LORD spoke unto him by the hand of Moses.
<br>6But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: ‘Ye have killed the people of the LORD.’ 7And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting; and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 8And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. 9And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 10’Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.’ And they fell upon their faces. 11And Moses said
<br> 
<br>unto Aaron: ‘Take thy fire-pan, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the LORD: the plague is begun.’ 12And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. 13And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 14Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. 15And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stayed.
<br>16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 17‘Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’house, of all their princes according to their fathers’houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man’s name upon his rod. 18And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers’houses. 19And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 20And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.’ 21And Moses spoke unto the children
<br> 
<br>of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 22And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony. 23And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 24And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod.
<br>25and the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.’ 26Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
<br>27And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. 28Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?’
<br>And the LORD said unto Aaron: ‘Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 2And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with
<br> 
<br>thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee, thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony. 3And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent; only they shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye. 4And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, whatsoever the service of the Tent may be; but a common man shall not draw nigh unto you. 5And ye shall keep the charge of the holy things, and the charge of the altar, that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. 6And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; for you they are given as a gift unto the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting. 7And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar, and to that within the veil; and ye shall serve; I give you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.’
<br>8And the LORD spoke unto Aaron: ‘And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of My heave-offerings; even of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel unto thee have I given them for a consecrated portion, and to thy sons, as a due for ever. 9This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every
<br> 
<br>guilt-offering of theirs, which they may render unto Me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. 10In a most holy place shalt thou eat thereof; every male may eat thereof; it shall be holy unto thee. 11And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. 12All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the corn, the first part of them which they give unto the LORD, to thee have I given them. 13The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. 14Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 15Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto the LORD, both of man and beast, shall be thine; howbeit the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 16And their redemption- money—from a month old shalt thou redeem them—shall be, according to thy valuation, five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary—the same is twenty gerahs. 17But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt dash their blood against the altar, and shalt make their fat smoke for an offering made by fire, for a sweet
<br> 
<br>savour unto the LORD. 18And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave- breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine. 19All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a due for ever; it is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.’
<br>20And the LORD said unto Aaron: ‘Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them; I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 21And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. 22And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 23But the Levites alone shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 24For the tithe of the children of Israel,
<br>which they set apart as a gift unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites for
<br> 
<br>When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall set apart of it a gift for the LORD, even a tithe of the tithe. 27And the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the wine-press. 28Thus ye also shall set apart a gift unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto the LORD to Aaron the priest. 29Out of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. 30Therefore thou shalt say unto them: When ye set apart the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press. 31And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. 32And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that ye have set apart from it the best thereof; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.’

<br> 
<br>an inheritance; therefore I have said unto them: Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’
<br> 
<br>19
<br>saying:
<br> 
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses	and	unto	Aaron,
<br> 
<br>25And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 26’Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them:
<br> 
<br>2This is the statute of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying: Speak unto the children of Israel, that
<br> 
<br>they bring thee a red heifer, faultless, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke. 3And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and she shall be brought forth without the camp, and she shall be slain before his face. 4And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. 5And the heifer shall be burnt in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt. 6And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 7Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 8And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 9And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling; it is a purification from sin. 10And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. 11He that toucheth the dead, even any man’s dead body, shall be unclean seven days; 12the same shall purify himself
<br> 
<br>therewith on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day and the seventh day, he shall not be clean. 13Whosoever toucheth the dead, even the body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself—he hath defiled the tabernacle of the LORD— that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. 14This is the law: when a man dieth in a tent, every one that cometh into the tent, and every thing that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 15And every open vessel, which hath no covering close-bound upon it, is unclean. 16And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or one that dieth of himself, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 17And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the purification from sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel. 18And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave. 19And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. 20But the
<br> 
<br>man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water of sprinkling hath not been dashed against him: he is unclean. 21And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them; and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until even. 22And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth him shall be unclean until even.
<br>
<br>And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
<br>came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 2And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 3And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying: ‘Would that we had perished when our brethren perished before the LORD! 4And why have ye brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, to die there, we and our cattle? 5And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.’ 6And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of
<br> 
<br>meeting, and fell upon their faces; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. 7And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 8’Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.’ 9And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as He commanded him. 10And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them: ‘Hear now, ye rebels; are we to bring you forth water out of this rock?’ 11And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. 12And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron: ‘Because ye believed not in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.’ 13These are the waters of aMeribah, where the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and He was sanctified in them.
<br>14And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: ‘Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us; 15how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with
<br>
<br>a That is, Strife.
<br> 
<br>us, and our fathers; 16and when we cried unto the LORD, He heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. 17Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land; we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king’s highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.’ 18And Edom said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.’ 19And the children of Israel said unto him: ‘We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof; let me only pass through on my feet; there is no hurt.’ 20And he said: ‘Thou shalt not pass through.’ And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 21Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; wherefore Israel turned away from him.
<br>22And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. 23And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying: 24’Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against My word at the waters of Meribah. 25Take Aaron
<br> 
<br>and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor. 26And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.’ 27And Moses did as the LORD commanded; and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 28And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 29And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
<br>
<br>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South,
<br>heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 2And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said: ‘If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.’ 3And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the name of the place was called aHormah.
<br>4And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way. 5And the people
<br>
<br>a That is, Utter destruction.
<br> 
<br>spoke against God, and against Moses: ‘Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.’ 6And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. 7And the people came to Moses, and said: ‘We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that He take away the serpents from us.’ And Moses prayed for the people. 8And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.’ 9And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the pole; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived. 10And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth. 11And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is in front of Moab, toward the sun-rising. 12From thence they journeyed, and pitched in the valley of Zered. 13From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites.—For Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites; 14wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the LORD:
<br>Vaheb in Suphah,
<br> 
<br>And the valleys of Arnon,
<br>15And the slope of the valleys
<br>That inclineth toward the seat of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of
<br>Moab.—
<br>16And from thence to aBeer; that is the well whereof the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Gather the people together, and I will give them water.’ 17Then sang Israel this song:
<br>Spring up, O well—sing ye unto it—
<br>18The well, which the princes digged,
<br>Which the nobles of the people delved,
<br>With the sceptre, and with their staves.
<br>And from the wilderness to Mattanah; 19and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 20and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.
<br>21And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: 22’Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells; we will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed thy border.’ 23And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to
<br>
<br>a That is, A well.
<br> 
<br>Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 24And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 25And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. 26For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon. 27Wherefore they that speak in parables say:
<br>Come ye to Heshbon!
<br>Let the city of Sihon be built and established!
<br>28For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon;
<br>It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of
<br>Arnon.
<br>29Woe to thee, Moab!
<br>Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh;
<br>He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 30We have shot at them—Heshbon
<br>is perished—even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto
<br>Nophah,
<br>Which reacheth unto Medeba.
<br>31Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 32And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were
<br> 
<br>there. 33And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 34And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’ 35So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining; and they possessed his land.
<br>And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the
<br>plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
<br>בלק
<br>2And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 3And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel. 4And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: ‘Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.’—And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.— 5And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying: ‘Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me. 6Come now therefore, I pray thee,
<br> 
<br>curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.’ 7And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. 8And he said unto them: ‘Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak unto me’; and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 9And God came unto Balaam, and said: ‘What men are these with thee?’ 10And Balaam said unto God: ‘Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me [saying]: 11Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’ 12And God said unto Balaam: ‘Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.’ 13And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: ‘Get you into your land; for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.’ 14And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: ‘Balaam refuseth to come with us.’ 15And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 16And they came to Balaam, and said to him: ‘Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let
<br> 
<br>nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me; 17for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.’ 18And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do any thing, small or great. 19Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more.’ 20And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: ‘If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.’ 21And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 22And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.— Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.— 23And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 24Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side. 25And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot
<br> 
<br>against the wall; and he smote her again. 26And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 27And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. 28And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: ‘What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?’ 29And Balaam said unto the ass: ‘Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.’ 30And the ass said unto Balaam: ‘Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?’ And he said: ‘Nay.’ 31Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. 32And the angel of the LORD said unto him: ‘Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me; 33and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.’ 34And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD: ‘I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; now therefore, if it displease thee,
<br> 
<br>I will get me back.’ 35And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam: ‘Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.’ So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 36And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 37And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?’ 38And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.’ 39And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. 40And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 41And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.
<br>And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars,
<br>and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’ 2And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 3And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Stand by thy burnt- offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell
<br> 
<br>thee.’ And he went to a bare height. 4And God met Balaam; and he said unto Him: ‘I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.’ 5And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.’ 6And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 7And he took up his parable, and said:
<br>From Aram Balak bringeth me,
<br>The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:
<br>‘Come, curse me Jacob, And come, execrate Israel.’
<br>8How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?
<br>And how shall I execrate, whom the LORD hath not execrated?
<br>9For from the top of the rocks I see him,
<br>And from the hills I behold him:
<br>Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone,
<br>And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
<br>10Who hath counted the dust of Jacob,
<br>Or numbered the stock of Israel?
<br>Let me die the death of the righteous,
<br>And let mine end be like his!
<br>11And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.’ 12And he answered and said: ‘Must I not take
<br> 
<br>heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?’ 13And Balak said unto him: ‘Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.’ 14And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. 15And he said unto Balak: ‘Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.’ 16And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.’ 17And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: ‘What hath the LORD spoken?’ 18And he took up his parable, and said:
<br>Arise, Balak, and hear;
<br>Give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:
<br>19God is not a man, that He should lie;
<br>Neither the son of man, that He should repent:
<br>When He hath said, will He not do it?
<br>Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?
<br>20Behold, I am bidden to bless;
<br>And when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back.
<br>21None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob,
<br> 
<br>Neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel;
<br>The LORD his God is with him,
<br>And the shouting for the King is among them.
<br>22God who brought them forth out of Egypt
<br>Is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox.
<br>23For there is no enchantment with Jacob,
<br>Neither is there any divination with Israel;
<br>Now is it said of Jacob and of Israel: ‘What hath God wrought! ’ 24Behold a people that riseth up as a
<br>lioness,
<br>And as a lion doth he lift himself up;
<br>He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
<br>And drink the blood of the slain.
<br>25And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.’ 26But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: ‘Told not I thee, saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?’ 27And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.’ 28And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. 29And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’ 30And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
<br> 
<br>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless
<br>Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 2And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of God came upon him. 3And he took up his parable, and said:
<br>The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,
<br>And the saying of the man whose eye is opened;
<br>4The saying of him who heareth the words of God,
<br>Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Fallen down, yet with opened eyes:
<br>5How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy dwellings, O Israel!
<br>6As valleys stretched out,
<br>As gardens by the river-side; As aloes planted of the LORD, As cedars beside the waters;
<br>7Water shall flow from his branches,
<br>And his seed shall be in many waters;
<br>And his king shall be higher than Agag,
<br>And his kingdom shall be exalted.
<br>8God who brought him forth out of Egypt
<br>Is for him like the lofty horns of the wild-ox;
<br>He shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries,
<br>And shall break their bones in pieces,
<br> 
<br>And pierce them through with his arrows.
<br>9He couched, he lay down as a lion,
<br>And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
<br>Blessed be every one that blesseth thee,
<br>And cursed be every one that curseth thee.
<br>10And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam: ‘I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. 11Therefore now flee thou to thy place; I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.’ 12And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Spoke I not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me, saying: 13If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what the LORD speaketh, that will I speak? 14And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days.’ 15And he took up his parable, and said:
