<br>28	And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.
<br>29	I will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful to him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	And I will make his seed to endure for ev- ermore: and his throne as the days of heaven.
<br>31	And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:
<br>32	If they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments:
<br>33	I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with stripes.
<br>34	But my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my truth to fail.
<br>35	Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.
<br>36	Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:
<br>37	His seed shall endure for ever.
<br>38	And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful wit- ness in heaven.
<br>39	But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with my anointed.
<br>40	Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.
<br>41	Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength fear.
<br>42	All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
<br>43	Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
<br>44	Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not assisted him in battle.
<br>45	Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.
<br>46	Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him with confusion.
<br>47	How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger burn like fire?
<br> 
<br>48	Remember what my substance is: for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?
<br>49	Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?
<br>50	Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, ac- cording to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?
<br>51	Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have held in my bosom) of many nations:
<br>52	Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.
<br>53	Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it.
<br>So be it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 89
<br>A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to genera- tion.
<br>2	Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.
<br>3	Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men. 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are as yes- terday, which is past. And as a watch in the
<br>night,
<br>5	Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.
<br>6	In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither. 7 For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and
<br>are troubled in thy indignation.
<br>8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be consid- ered as a spider:
<br>10	The days of our years in them are three- score and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected.
<br>11	Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear
<br>12	Can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wis- dom.
<br>13	Return, O Lord, how long? and be en- treated in favour of thy servants.
<br>14	We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.
<br>15	We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils.
<br>16	Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children.
<br>17	And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.
<br>
<br>Chapter 90
<br>
<br>The praise of a canticle for David. He that dwelleth in the aid of the most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.
<br>2	He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my pro- tector, and my refuge: my God, in him will I trust.
<br>3	For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: and from the sharp word.
<br> 
<br>4	He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: and under his wings thou shalt trust.
<br>5	His truth shall compass thee with a shield: thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night. 6 Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh about in the dark: of in-
<br>vasion, or of the noonday devil.
<br>7	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.
<br>8	But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: and shalt see the reward of the wicked.
<br>9	Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou hast made the most High thy refuge.
<br>10	There shall no evil come to thee: nor shall the scourge come near thy dwelling.
<br>11	For he hath given his angels charge over thee; to keep thee in all thy ways.
<br>12	In their hands they shall bear thee up: lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>13	Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon.
<br>14	Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: I will protect him because he hath known my name.
<br>15	He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I am with him in tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.
<br>16	I will fill him with length of days; and I will shew him my salvation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 91
<br>A psalm of a canticle on the sabbath day.
<br>2	It is good to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to thy name, O most High.
<br>3	To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the night:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: with a canticle upon the harp.
<br>5	For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
<br>6	O Lord, how great are thy works! thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
<br>7	The senseless man shall not know: nor will the fool understand these things.
<br>8	When the wicked shall spring up as grass: and all the workers of iniquity shall appear: That they may perish for ever and ever:
<br>9	But thou, O Lord, art most high for ever- more.
<br>10	For behold thy enemies, O lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
<br>11	But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: and my old age in plentiful mercy. 12 My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: and my ear shall hear of the downfall
<br>of the malignant that rise up against me.
<br>13	The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
<br>14	They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
<br>15	They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: and shall be well treated,
<br>16	That they may shew, That the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 92
<br>
<br>The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty: the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established the world which shall not be moved.
<br> 
<br>2	My throne is prepared from of old: thou art from everlasting.
<br>3	The floods have lifted up, O Lord: the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,
<br>4	With the noise of many waters. Wonderful are the surges of the sea: wonderful is the Lord on high.
<br>5	Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible: holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
<br>
<br>Chapter 93
<br>The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: the God of revenge hath acted freely.
<br>2	Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the proud.
<br>3	How long shall sinners, O Lord: how long shall sinners glory?
<br>4	Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: shall all speak who work injustice?
<br>5	Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: and they have afflicted thy inheritance.
<br>6	They have slain the widow and the stranger: and they have murdered the fatherless.
<br>7	And they have said: The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob understand.
<br>8	Understand, ye senseless among the people: and, you fools, be wise at last.
<br>9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider? 10 He that chastiseth nations, shall he not re-
<br>buke: he that teacheth man knowledge?
<br>11	The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain.
<br>12	Blessed is the man whom thou shalt in- struct, O Lord: and shalt teach him out of thy law.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: till a pit be dug for the wicked.
<br>14	For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he forsake his own inheritance.
<br>15	Until justice be turned into judgment: and they that are near it are all the upright in heart. 16 Who shall rise up for me against the evil- doers? or who shall stand with me against the
<br>workers of iniquity?
<br>17	Unless the Lord had been my helper, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.
<br>18	If I said: My foot is moved: thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.
<br>19	According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy comforts have given joy to my soul.
<br>20	Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, who framest labour in commandment?
<br>21	They will hunt after the soul of the just, and will condemn innocent blood.
<br>22	But the Lord is my refuge: and my God the help of my hope.
<br>23	And he will render them their iniquity : and in their malice he will destroy them:  the Lord our God will destroy them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 94
<br>Come let us praise the Lord with joy: let us joy- fully sing to God our saviour.
<br>2	Let us come before his presence with thanks- giving; and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.
<br>3	For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
<br>4	For in his hand are all the ends of the earth: and the heights of the mountains are his.
<br>5	For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
<br> 
<br>6	Come let us adore and fall down: and weep before the Lord that made us.
<br>7	For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. 8 To day if you shall hear his voice, harden
<br>not your hearts:
<br>9	As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness: where your fa- thers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my works.
<br>10	Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said: These always err in heart. 11 And these men have not known my ways: so I swore in my wrath that they shall not enter
<br>into my rest.
<br>
<br>Chapter 95
<br>A canticle for David himself, when the house was built after the captivity. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: sing to the Lord, all the earth.
<br>2	Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name: shew forth his salvation from day to day.
<br>3	Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.
<br>4	For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
<br>5	For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.
<br>6	Praise and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.
<br>7	Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to the Lord glory and honour:
<br>8	Bring to the Lord glory unto his name. Bring up sacrifices, and come into his courts:
<br>9	Adore ye the Lord in his holy court.  Let all the earth be moved at his presence.
<br>10	Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned. For he hath corrected the world, which
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall not be moved: he will judge the people with justice.
<br>11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof:
<br>12	The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then shall all the trees of the woods rejoice
<br>13	before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with his truth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 96
<br>For the same David, when his land was restored again to him. The Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.
<br>2	Clouds and darkness are round about him: justice and judgment are the establishment of his throne.
<br>3	A fire shall go before him, and shall burn his enemies round about.
<br>4	His lightnings have shone forth to the world: the earth saw and trembled.
<br>5	The mountains melted like wax, at the pres- ence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
<br>6	The heavens declared his justice: and all people saw his glory.
<br>7	Let them be all confounded that adore graven things, and that glory in their idols. Adore him, all you his angels:
<br>8	Sion heard, and was glad. And the daugh- ters of Juda rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Lord.
<br>9	For thou art the most high Lord over all the earth: thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.
<br> 
<br>10	You that love the Lord, hate evil: the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints, he will deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.
<br>11	Light is risen to the just, and joy to the right of heart.
<br>12	Rejoice, ye just, in the Lord: and give praise to the remembrance of his holiness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 97
<br>A psalm for David himself. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: because he hath done wonderful things. His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, and his arm is holy.
<br>2	The Lord hath made known his salvation: he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.
<br>3	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
<br>4	Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and sing.
<br>5	Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm:
<br>6	With long trumpets, and sound of cornet.
<br>Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king:
<br>7	Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.
<br>8	The rivers shall clap their hands, the moun- tains shall rejoice together
<br>9	At the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.
<br>
<br>Chapter 98
<br>A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned, let the people be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	The lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.
<br>3	Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy:
<br>4	And the king’s honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.
<br>5	Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is holy.
<br>6	Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:
<br>7	He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the command- ment which he gave them.
<br>8	Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.
<br>9	Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 99
<br>
<br>A psalm of praise.
<br>2	Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve ye the Lord with gladness. Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy.
<br>3	Know ye that the Lord he is God: he made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
<br>4	Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns: and give glory to him. Praise ye his name:
<br>5	For the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth to generation and generation.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 100
<br>A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, O Lord: I will sing,
<br>2	And I will understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
<br>3	I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the workers of iniquities.
<br>4	The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.
<br>5	The man that in private detracted his neigh- bour, him did I persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I would not eat.
<br>6	My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: the man that walked in the per- fect way, he served me.
<br>7	He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.
<br>8	In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 101
<br>The prayer of the poor man, when he was anx- ious, and poured out his supplication before the Lord.
<br>2	Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.
<br>3	Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily.
<br>4	For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	I am smitten as grass, and my heart is with- ered: because I forgot to eat my bread.
<br>6	Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.
<br>7	I am become like to a pelican of the wilder- ness: I am like a night raven in the house.
<br>8	I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.
<br>9	All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised me did swear against me. 10 For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled
<br>my drink with weeping.
<br>11 Because of thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up thou hast thrown me down. 12 My days have declined like a shadow, and
<br>I am withered like grass.
<br>13	But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy memorial to all generations.
<br>14	Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have mercy on it, for the time is come.
<br>15	For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall have pity on the earth thereof.
<br>16	All the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
<br>17	For the Lord hath built up Sion: and he shall be seen in his glory.
<br>18	He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not despised their petition. 19 Let these things be written unto another generation: and the people that shall be created
<br>shall praise the Lord:
<br>20	Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.
<br>21	That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that he might release the children of the slain:
<br> 
<br>22	That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his praise in Jerusalem;
<br>23	When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the Lord.
<br>24	He answered him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the fewness of my days.
<br>25	Call me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are unto generation and generation.
<br>26	In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
<br>27	They shall perish but thou remainest: and all of them shall grow old like a garment: And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.
<br>28	But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.
<br>29	The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be directed for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 102
<br>
<br>For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within me bless his holy name. 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget
<br>all he hath done for thee.
<br>3	Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.
<br>4	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion. 5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things:
<br>thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s.
<br>6	The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.
<br>7	He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children of Israel.
<br>8	The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	He will not always be angry: nor will he threaten for ever.
<br>10	He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 11 For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he hath strengthened his mercy
<br>towards them that fear him.
<br>12	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
<br>13	As a father hath compassion on his chil- dren, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him:
<br>14	For he knoweth our frame. He remem- bereth that we are dust:
<br>15	Man’s days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.
<br>16	For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: and he shall know his place no more.
<br>17	But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity upon them that fear him: And his justice unto children’s children,
<br>18	To such as keep his covenant, And are mindful of his commandments to do them.
<br>19	The lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: and his kingdom shall rule over all.
<br>20	Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.
<br>21	Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: you minis- ters of his that do his will.
<br>22	Bless the Lord, all his works: in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 103
<br>
<br>For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:
<br> 
<br>2	And art clothed with light as with a gar- ment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:
<br>3	Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.
<br>4	Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy min- isters a burning fire.
<br>5	Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever.
<br>6	The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand.
<br>7	At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.
<br>8	The mountains ascend, and the plains de- scend into the place which thou hast founded for them.
<br>9	Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.
<br>10	Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.
<br>11	All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.
<br>12	Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.
<br>13	Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:
<br>14	Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:
<br>15	And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man’s heart.
<br>16	The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron.
<br>18	The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.
<br>19	He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
<br>20	Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:
<br>21	The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.
<br>22	The sun ariseth, and they are gathered to- gether: and they shall lie down in their dens.
<br>23	Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.
<br>24	How great are thy works, O Lord ? thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.
<br>25	So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without num- ber: Creatures little and great.
<br>26	There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.
<br>27	All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.
<br>28	What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.
<br>29	But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.
<br>30	Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
<br>31 May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
<br>32	He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he troubleth the mountains, and they smoke.
<br> 
<br>33	I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 34 Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I
<br>will take delight in the Lord.
<br>35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 104
<br>
<br>Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds among the Gentiles.
<br>2	Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous works.
<br>3	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
<br>4	Seek ye the lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.
<br>5	Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.
<br>6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
<br>7	He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
<br>8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
<br>9	Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:
<br>10	And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:
<br>11	Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.
<br>12	When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners therein:
<br>13	And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their sakes.
<br>15	Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.
<br>16	And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.
<br>17	He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.
<br>18	They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,
<br>19	Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.
<br>20	The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.
<br>21	He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.
<br>22	That he might instruct his princes as him- self, and teach his ancients wisdom.
<br>23	And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.
<br>24	And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies.
<br>25	He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants.
<br>26	He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.
<br>27	He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.
<br>28	He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words.
<br>29	He turned their waters into blood, and de- stroyed their fish.
<br>30	Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.
<br>31	He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts.
<br>32	He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.
<br>33	And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their
<br> 
<br>coasts.
<br>34	He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number.
<br>35	And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground. 36 And he slew all the firstborn in their land:
<br>the firstfruits of all their labour.
<br>37	And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.
<br>38	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon them.
<br>39	He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night.
<br>40	They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
<br>41	He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land.
<br>42	Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.
<br>43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.
<br>44	And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people:
<br>45	That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law.
<br>
<br>Chapter 105
<br>Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2	Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises?
<br>3	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.
<br>4	Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with thy salvation.
<br>5	That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.
<br>6	We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.
<br>7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.
<br>8	And he saved them for his own name’s sake: that he might make his power known.
<br>9	And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.
<br>10	And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
<br>11	And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left.
<br>12	And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.
<br>13	They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsel.
<br>14	And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without wa- ter.
<br>15	And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls.
<br>16	And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
<br>17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Ab- iron.
<br>18	And a fire was kindled in their congrega- tion: the flame burned the wicked.
<br>19	They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing.
<br>20	And they changed their glory into the like- ness of a calf that eateth grass.
<br>21	They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
<br> 
<br>22	Wondrous works in the land of Cham: ter- rible things in the Red Sea.
<br>23	And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
<br>24	And they set at nought the desirable land.
<br>They believed not his word,
<br>25	And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
<br>26	And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert;
<br>27	And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.
<br>28	They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
<br>29	And they provoked him with their inven- tions: and destruction was multiplied among them.
<br>30	Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased.
<br>31	And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore.
<br>32	They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:
<br>33	Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips.
<br>34	They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.
<br>35	And they were mingled among the hea- thens, and learned their works:
<br>36	And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.
<br>37	And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.
<br>38	And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>39	And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions.
<br>40	And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.
<br>41	And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had do- minion over them.
<br>42	And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands:
<br>43	Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.
<br>44	And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer.
<br>45	And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mer- cies.
<br>46	And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives.
<br>47	Save us, O Lord, our God:   and gather us from among the nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.
<br>48	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 106
<br>Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2 Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries. 3 From the rising and from the setting of the
<br>sun, from the north and from the sea.
<br>4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.
<br> 
<br>5	They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
<br>6	And they cried to the Lord in their tribu- lation: and he delivered them out of their dis- tresses.
<br>7	And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
<br>8	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.
<br>9	For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.
<br>10	Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron.
<br>11	Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High:
<br>12	And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened, and there was none to help them.
<br>13	Then they cried to the Lord in their af- fliction: and he delivered them out of their dis- tresses.
<br>14	And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder.
<br>15	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
<br>16	Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.
<br>17	He took them out of the way of their iniq- uity: for they were brought low for their injus- tices.
<br>18	Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.
<br>19	And they cried to the Lord in their af- fliction: and he delivered them out of their dis- tresses.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their destructions.
<br>21	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.
<br>22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his works with joy.
<br>23	They that go down to the sea in ships, do- ing business in the great waters:
<br>24	These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
<br>25	He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up.
<br>26	They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: their soul pined away with evils.
<br>27	They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swal- lowed up.
<br>28	And they cried to the Lord in their afflic- tion: and he brought them out of their distresses. 29 And he turned the storm into a breeze: and
<br>its waves were still.
<br>30	And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.
<br>31	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
<br>32	And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients.
<br>33	He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of waters into dry ground:
<br>34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
<br>35	He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land into water springs.
<br>36	And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation.
<br> 
<br>37	Anti they sowed fields, and planted vine- yards: and they yielded fruit of birth.
<br>38	And he blessed them, and they were mul- tiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.
<br>39	Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.
<br>40	Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.
<br>41	And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep.
<br>42	The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
<br>43	Who is wise, and will keep these things; and will understand the mercies of the Lord?
<br>
<br>Chapter 107
<br>A canticle of a psalm for David himself.
<br>2	My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and will give praise, with my glory.
<br>3	Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise in the morning early.
<br>4	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee among the nations.
<br>5	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto the clouds.
<br>6	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth:
<br>7	That thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand and hear me.
<br>8	God hath spoken in his holiness. I will re- joice, and I will divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.
<br>9	Galaad is mine: and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection of my head. Juda is my king:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	Moab the pot of my hope.   Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe: the aliens are become my friends.
<br>11	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
<br>12	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off
<br>? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies?
<br>13	O grant us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
<br>14	Through God we shall do mightily: and he will bring our enemies to nothing.
<br>
<br>Chapter 108
<br>
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David.
<br>2	O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.
<br>3	They have spoken against me with deceit- ful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.
<br>4	Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer.
<br>5	And they repaid me evil for good: and ha- tred for my love.
<br>6	Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand.
<br>7	When he is judged, may he go out con- demned; and may his prayer be turned to sin.
<br>8 May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.
<br>9 May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
<br>10 Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings.
<br> 
<br>11 May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours.
<br>12 May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.
<br>13 May his posterity be cut off; in one gener- ation may his name be blotted out.
<br>14 May the iniquity of his fathers be remem- bered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
<br>15 May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth: 16 because he remembered not to shew mercy,
<br>17 But persecuted the poor man and the beg- gar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death. 18 And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his
<br>entrails, and like oil in his bones.
<br>19 May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.
<br>20	This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul.
<br>21	But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,
<br>22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.
<br>23	I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts.
<br>24	My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed for oil.
<br>25	And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads.
<br>26	Help me, O Lord my God; save me; accord- ing to thy mercy.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>27	And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.
<br>28	They will curse and thou wilt bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.
<br>29	Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their con- fusion as with a double cloak.
<br>30	I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him.
<br>31	Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 109
<br>
<br>A psalm for David. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<br>2	The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
<br>3	With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee.
<br>4	The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
<br>5	The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.
<br>6	He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush the heads in the land of many.
<br>7	He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 110
<br>
<br>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council of the just, and in the congrega- tion.
<br>2	Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills.
<br>3	His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever.
<br>4	He hath made a remembrance of his wonder- ful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord:
<br>5	He hath given food to them that fear him.
<br>He will be mindful for ever of his covenant:
<br>6	He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.
<br>7	That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works of his hands are truth and judgment.
<br>8	All his commandments are faithful: con- firmed for ever and ever, made in truth and eq- uity.
<br>9	He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name:
<br>10	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 111
<br>
<br>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments. 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the
<br>generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
<br>3	Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
<br>4	To the righteous a light is risen up in dark- ness: he is merciful, and compassionate and just.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judg- ment:
<br>6	Because he shall not be moved for ever.
<br>7	The just shall be in everlasting remem- brance: he shall not fear the evil hearing. His heart is ready to hope in the Lord:
<br>8	His heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.
<br>9	He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory.
<br>10	The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 112
<br>
<br>Praise the Lord, ye children: praise ye the name of the Lord.
<br>2	Blessed be the name of the Lord, from hence- forth now and for ever.
<br>3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.
<br>4	The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the heavens.
<br>5	Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high: 6 and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth?
<br>7	Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill:
<br>8	That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his people.
<br>9	Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother of children.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 113
<br>When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Ja- cob from a barbarous people:
<br>2	Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his do- minion.
<br>3	The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
<br>4	The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock.
<br>5	What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
<br>6	Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?
<br>7	At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob:
<br>8	Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters.
<br>Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.
<br>2	For thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake: lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?
<br>3	But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would.
<br>4	The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men.
<br>5	They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not.
<br>6	They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not.
<br>7	They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: neither shall they cry out through their throat.
<br>8	Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as trust in them.
<br>9	The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.
<br>10	The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.
<br>12	The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.
<br>13	He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.
<br>14 May the Lord add blessings upon you: upon you, and upon your children.
<br>15	Blessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
<br>16	The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s: but the earth he has given to the children of men.
<br>17	The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: nor any of them that go down to hell.
<br>18	But we that live bless the Lord: from this time now and for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 114
<br>I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.
<br>2	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will call upon him.
<br>3	The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the perils of hell have found me. I met with trouble and sorrow:
<br>4	And I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, deliver my soul.
<br>5	The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.
<br>6	The Lord is the keeper of little ones: I was humbled, and he delivered me.
<br>7	Turn, O my soul, into thy rest: for the Lord hath been bountiful to thee.
<br>8	For he hath delivered my soul from death: my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
<br>9	I will please the Lord in the land of the liv- ing.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 115
<br>11 I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.
<br>12	What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things that he hath rendered to me?
<br>13	I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
<br>14	I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people:
<br>15	Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
<br>16	O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds:
<br>17	I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
<br>18	I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people:
<br>19	In the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 116
<br>O Praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
<br>2 For his mercy is confirmed upon us: and the truth of the Lord remaineth for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 117
<br>Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2	Let Israel now say, that he is good: that his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>3	Let the  house of  Aaron now  say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>4	Let them that fear the Lord now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	In my trouble I called upon the Lord: and the Lord heard me, and enlarged me.
<br>6	The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man can do unto me.
<br>7	The Lord is my helper: and I will look over my enemies.
<br>8	It is good to confide in the Lord, rather than to have confidence in man.
<br>9	It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes.
<br>10	All nations compassed me about; and, in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.
<br>11	Surrounding me they compassed me about: and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.
<br>12	They surrounded me like bees, and they burned like fire among thorns: and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them.
<br>13	Being pushed I was overturned that I might fall: but the Lord supported me.
<br>14	The Lord is my strength and my praise: and he is become my salvation.
<br>15	The voice of rejoicing and of salvation is in the tabernacles of the just.
<br>16	The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me: the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.
<br>17	I shall not die, but live: and shall declare the works of the Lord.
<br>18	The Lord chastising hath chastised me: but he hath not delivered me over to death.
<br>19	Open ye to me the gates of justice: I will go in to them, and give praise to the Lord.
<br>20	This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it.
<br>21	I will give glory to thee because thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
<br> 
<br>22	The stone which the builders rejected; the same is become the head of the corner.
<br>23	This is the Lord’s doing , and it is wonder- ful in our eyes.
<br>24	This is the day which the Lord hath made: let us be glad and rejoice therein.
<br>25	O Lord, save me: O Lord, give good suc- cess.
<br>26	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord. We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.
<br>27	The Lord is God, and he hath shone upon us. Appoint a solemn day, with shady boughs, even to the horn of the altar.
<br>28	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, and I will exalt thee. I will praise thee, because thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
<br>29	O praise ye the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 118
<br>
<br>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.
<br>2	Blessed are they that search his testimonies: that seek him with their whole heart.
<br>3	For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways.
<br>4	Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently.
<br>5	O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications.
<br>6	Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy commandments.
<br>7	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	I will keep thy justifications: O! do not thou utterly forsake me.
<br>9	By what doth a young man correct his way? by observing thy words.
<br>10	With my whole heart have I sought after thee: let me not stray from thy commandments. 11 Thy words have I hidden in my heart, that
<br>I may not sin against thee.
<br>12	Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy justifications.
<br>13	With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.
<br>14	I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches.
<br>15	I will meditate on thy commandments: and I will consider thy ways.
<br>16	I will think of thy justifications: I will not forget thy words.
<br>17	Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: and I shall keep thy words.
<br>18	Open thou my eyes: and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law.
<br>19	I am a sojourner on the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
<br>20	My soul hath coveted to long for thy justi- fications, at all times.
<br>21	Thou hast rebuked the proud: they are cursed who decline from thy commandments.
<br>22	Remove from me reproach and contempt: because I have sought after thy testimonies.
<br>23	For princes sat, and spoke against me: but thy servant was employed in thy justifications.
<br>24	For thy testimonies are my meditation: and thy justifications my counsel.
<br>25	My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: quicken thou me according to thy word.
<br>26	I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: teach me thy justifications.
<br>27	Make me to understand the way of thy jus- tifications: and I shall be exercised in thy won-
<br> 
<br>drous works.
<br>28	My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: strengthen thou me in thy words.
<br>29	Remove from me the way of iniquity: and out of thy law have mercy on me.
<br>30	I have chosen the way of truth: thy judg- ments I have not forgotten.
<br>31	I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: put me not to shame.
<br>32	I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge my heart.
<br>33	Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: and I will always seek after it.
<br>34	Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; and I will keep it with my whole heart. 35 Lead me into the path of thy command-
<br>ments; for this same I have desired.
<br>36	Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness.
<br>37	Turn away my eyes that they may not be- hold vanity: quicken me in thy way.
<br>38	Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy fear.
<br>39	Turn away my reproach, which I have ap- prehended: for thy judgments are delightful.
<br>40	Behold I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy justice.
<br>42	So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; that I have trusted in thy words.
<br>43	And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.
<br>44	So shall I always keep thy law, for ever and ever.
<br>45	And I walked at large: because I have sought after thy commandments.
<br>46	And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: and I was not ashamed.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>47	I meditated also on thy commandments, which I loved.
<br>48	And I lifted up my hands to thy command- ments, which I loved: and I was exercised in thy justifications.
<br>49	Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, in which thou hast given me hope.
<br>50	This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath enlivened me.
<br>51	The proud did iniquitously altogether: but I declined not from thy law.
<br>52	I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: and I was comforted.
<br>53	A fainting hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
<br>54	Thy justifications were the subject of my song, in the place of my pilgrimage.
<br>55	In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: and have kept thy law.
<br>56	This happened to me: because I sought after thy justifications.
<br>57	O Lord, my portion, I have said, I would keep thy law.
<br>58	I entreated thy face with all my heart: have mercy on me according to thy word.
<br>59	I have thought on my ways: and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
<br>60	I am ready, and am not troubled: that I may keep thy commandments.
<br>61	The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.
<br>62	I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; for the judgments of thy justification.
<br>63	I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, and that keep thy commandments.
<br>64	The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy justifications.
<br>65	Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word.
<br> 
<br>66	Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; for I have believed thy command- ments.
<br>67	Before I was humbled I offended; therefore have I kept thy word.
<br>68	Thou art good; and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.
<br>69	The iniquity of the proud hath been multi- plied over me: but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.
<br>70	Their heart is curdled like milk: but I have meditated on thy law.
<br>71	It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, that I may learn thy justifications.
<br>72	The law of thy mouth is good to me, above thousands of gold and silver.
<br>73	Thy hands have made me and formed me: give me understanding, and I will learn thy com- mandments.
<br>74	They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad : because I have greatly hoped in thy words.
<br>75	I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: and in thy truth thou hast humbled me. 76 O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, ac-
<br>cording to thy word unto thy servant.
<br>77	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: for thy law is my meditation.
<br>78	Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: but I will be employed in thy commandments.
<br>79	Let them that fear thee turn to me: and they that know thy testimonies.
<br>80	Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifica- tions, that I may not be confounded.
<br>81	My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: and in thy word I have very much hoped.
<br>82	My eyes have failed for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort me?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>83	For I am become like a bottle in the frost: I have not forgotten thy justifications.
<br>84	How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
<br>85	The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law.
<br>86	All thy statutes are truth: they have per- secuted me unjustly, do thou help me.
<br>87	They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I have not forsaken thy command- ments.
<br>88	Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth.
<br>89	For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven.
<br>90	Thy truth unto all generations: thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth.
<br>91	By thy ordinance the day goeth on: for all things serve thee.
<br>92	Unless thy law had been my meditation, I had then perhaps perished in my abjection.
<br>93	Thy justifications I will never forget: for by them thou hast given me life.
<br>94	I am thine, save thou me: for I have sought thy justifications.
<br>95	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I have understood thy testimonies.
<br>96	I have seen an end of all perfection: thy commandment is exceeding broad.
<br>97	O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! it is my meditation all the day.
<br>98	Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: for it is ever with me.
<br>99	I have understood more than all my teach- ers: because thy testimonies are my meditation. 100 I have had understanding above ancients:
<br>because I have sought thy commandments.
<br> 
<br>101	I have restrained my feet from every evil way: that I may keep thy words.
<br>102	I have not declined from thy judgments, because thou hast set me a law.
<br>103	How sweet are thy words to my palate! more than honey to my mouth.
<br>104	By thy commandments I have had under- standing: therefore have I hated every way of iniquity.
<br>105	Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.
<br>106	I have sworn and am determined to keep the judgments of thy justice.
<br>107	I have been humbled, O Lord, exceed- ingly: quicken thou me according to thy word.
<br>108	The free offerings of my mouth make ac- ceptable, O Lord: and teach me thy judgments. 109 My soul is continually in my hands: and
<br>I have not forgotten thy law.
<br>110	Sinners have laid a snare for me: but I have not erred from thy precepts.
<br>111	I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever: because they are the joy of my heart.
<br>112	I have inclined my heart to do thy justi- fications for ever, for the reward.
<br>113	I have hated the unjust: and have loved thy law.
<br>114	Thou art my helper and my protector: and in thy word I have greatly hoped.
<br>115	Depart from me, ye malignant: and I will search the commandments of my God.
<br>116	Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: and let me not be confounded in my expectation.
<br>117	Help me, and I shall be saved: and I will meditate always on thy justifications.
<br>118	Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments; for their thought is unjust.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>119	I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators: therefore have I loved thy testimonies.
<br>120	Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: for I am afraid of thy judgments.
<br>121	I have done judgment and justice: give me not up to them that slander me.
<br>122	Uphold thy servant unto good: let not the proud calumniate me.
<br>123	My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: and for the word of thy justice.
<br>124	Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: and teach me thy justifications.
<br>125	I am thy servant: give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.
<br>126	It is time, O Lord, to do: they have dis- sipated thy law.
<br>127	Therefore have I loved thy command- ments above gold and the topaz.
<br>128	Therefore was I directed to all thy com- mandments: I have hated all wicked ways.
<br>129	Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore my soul hath sought them.
<br>130	The declaration of thy words giveth light: and giveth understanding to little ones.
<br>131	I opened my mouth, and panted: because I longed for thy commandments.
<br>132	Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me according to the judgment of them that love thy name.
<br>133	Direct my steps according to thy word: and let no iniquity have dominion over me.
<br>134	Redeem me from the calumnies of men: that I may keep thy commandments.
<br>135	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: and teach me thy justifications.
<br>136	My eyes have sent forth springs of water: because they have not kept thy law.
<br>137	Thou art just, O Lord: and thy judgment is right.
<br> 
<br>138	Thou hast commanded justice thy testi- monies: and thy truth exceedingly.
<br>139	My zeal hath made me pine away: be- cause my enemies forgot thy words.
<br>140	Thy word is exceedingly refined: and thy servant hath loved it.
<br>141	I am very young and despised; but I forget not thy justifications.
<br>142	Thy justice is justice for ever: and thy law is the truth.
<br>143	Trouble and anguish have found me: thy commandments are my meditation.
<br>144	Thy testimonies are justice for ever: give me understanding, and I shall live.
<br>145	I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: I will seek thy justifications.
<br>146	I cried unto thee, save me: that I may keep thy commandments.
<br>147	I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: because in thy words I very much hoped. 148 My eyes to thee have prevented the morn-
<br>ing: that I might meditate on thy words.
<br>149	Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: and quicken me according to thy judgment.
<br>150	They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; but they are gone far off from thy law.
<br>151	Thou art near, O Lord: and all thy ways are truth.
<br>152	I have known from the beginning con- cerning thy testimonies: that thou hast founded them for ever.
<br>153	See my humiliation and deliver me for I have not forgotten thy law.
<br>154	Judge my judgment and redeem me: quicken thou me for thy word’s sake.
<br>155	Salvation is far from sinners; because they have not sought thy justifications.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>156	Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: quicken me according to thy judgment.
<br>157	Many are they that persecute me and af- flict me; but I have not declined from thy testi- monies.
<br>158	I beheld the transgressors, and pined away; because they kept not thy word.
<br>159	Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; quicken me thou in thy mercy.
<br>160	The beginning of thy words is truth: all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.
<br>161	Princes have persecuted me without cause: and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.
<br>162	I will rejoice at thy words, as one that hath found great spoil.
<br>163	I have hated and abhorred iniquity; but I have loved thy law.
<br>164	Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, for the judgments of thy justice.
<br>165	Much peace have they that love thy law, and to them there is no stumbling. block.
<br>166	I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: and I loved thy commandments.
<br>167	My soul hath kept thy testimonies and hath loved them exceedingly.
<br>168	I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: because all my ways are in thy sight. 169 Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: give me understanding according to
<br>thy word.
<br>170	Let my request come in before thee; de- liver thou me according to thy word.
<br>171	My lips shall utter a hymn, when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.
<br>172	My tongue shall pronounce thy word: be- cause all thy commandments are justice.
<br>173	Let thy hand be with me to save me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
<br> 
<br>174	I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my meditation.
<br>175	My soul shall live and shall praise thee: and thy judgments shall help me.
<br>176	I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.
<br>
<br>Chapter 119
<br>In my trouble I cried to the Lord: and he heard me.
<br>2	O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful tongue.
<br>3	What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a deceitful tongue?
<br>4	The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.
<br>5	Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged!
<br>I have dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar:
<br>6	My soul hath been long a sojourner.
<br>7	With them that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.
<br>
<br>Chapter 120
<br>I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me.
<br>2 My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
<br>3 May he not suffer thy foot to be moved: neither let him slumber that keepeth thee.
<br>4	Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep, that keepeth Israel.
<br>5	The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy pro- tection upon thy right hand.
<br>6	The sun shall not burn thee by day: nor the moon by night.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	The Lord keepeth thee from all evil: may the Lord keep thy soul.
<br>8 May the Lord keep thy coming in and thy going out; from henceforth now and for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 121
<br>A gradual canticle.
<br>2	Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem.
<br>3	Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together.
<br>4	For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: the testimony of Israel, to praise the name of the Lord.
<br>5	Because their seats have sat in judgment, seats upon the house of David.
<br>6	Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: and abundance for them that love thee.
<br>7	Let peace be in thy strength: and abundance in thy towers.
<br>8	For the sake of my brethren, and of my neighbours, I spoke peace of thee.
<br>9	Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 122
<br>To thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven.
<br>2	Behold as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters, As the eyes of the hand- maid are on the hands of her mistress: so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.
<br>3	Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for we are greatly filled with contempt.
<br> 
<br>4	For our soul is greatly filled: we are a re- proach to the rich, and contempt to the proud.
<br>
<br>Chapter 123
<br>A gradual canticle. If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say:
<br>2	If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up against us,
<br>3	Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was enkindled against us,
<br>4	Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.
<br>5	Our soul hath passed through a torrent: per- haps our soul had passed through a water insup- portable.
<br>6	Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.
<br>7	Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken, and we are delivered.
<br>8	Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 124
<br>A gradual canticle. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion: he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth
<br>2	In Jerusalem. Mountains are round about it: so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth now and for ever.
<br>3	For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of the just: that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.
<br>4	Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and to the upright of heart.
<br>5	But such as turn aside into bonds, the Lord shall lead out with the workers of iniquity: peace upon Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 125
<br>
<br>A gradual canticle. When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men com- forted.
<br>2	Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.
<br>3	The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.
<br>4	Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.
<br>5	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
<br>6	Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.
<br>7	But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 126
<br>
<br>A gradual canticle of Solomon. Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
<br>2	It is vain for you to rise before light, rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved,
<br>3	Behold the inheritance of the Lord are chil- dren: the reward, the fruit of the womb.
<br>4	As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them that have been shaken.
<br>5	Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 127
<br>
<br>A gradual canticle. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: that walk in his ways.
<br>2	For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
<br>3	Thy wife as a fruitful vine, on the sides of thy house. Thy children as olive plants, round about thy table.
<br>4	Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
<br>5 May the Lord bless thee out of Sion: and mayst thou see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
<br>6 And mayst thou see thy children’s children, peace upon Israel.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 128
<br>
<br>A gradual canticle.	Often have they fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say.
<br>2	Often have they fought against me from my youth: but they could not prevail over me.
<br>3	The wicked have wrought upon my back: they have lengthened their iniquity.
<br>4	The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners:
<br>5	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.
<br>6	Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses: which withereth before it be plucked up:
<br>7	Who with the mower filleth not his hand: nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.
<br>8	And they that passed by have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 129
<br>A gradual canticle. Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord:
<br>2	Lord, hear my voice. Let thy ears be atten- tive to the voice of my supplication.
<br>3	If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities: Lord, who shall stand it.
