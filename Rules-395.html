<br>
<br>(iv) agrees to issue a firm commitment within 12 months of delegation.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall retain the authority to process funding under this section in cases in which no State or local housing agency has applied to provide delegated processing pursuant to this paragraph or no such agency has entered into an agreement with the Secretary to serve as a delegated processing agency.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall develop a schedule for reasonable fees under this subparagraph to be paid to delegated processing agencies, which shall take into consideration any other fees to be paid to the agency for other funding provided to the project by the agency, including bonds, tax credits, and other gap funding.
<br>
<br>(D) Assistance under subsection (c)(2) may be provided for projects which identify in the application for assistance a defined health and other supportive services program including sources of financing the services for eligible residents and memoranda of understanding with service provision agencies and organizations to provide such services for eligible residents at their request. Such supportive services plan and memoranda of understating shall—
<br>
<br>(i) identify the target populations to be served by the project;
<br>
<br>(ii) set forth methods for outreach and referral;
<br>
<br>(iii) identify the health and other supportive services to be provided; and

<br>
<br>(E) Under such delegated system, the Secretary shall retain the authority to approve rents and development costs and to execute funding under this section within 60 days of receipt of the commitment from the State or local agency. The Secretary shall provide to such agency and the project sponsor, in writing, the reasons for any reduction in funding under this section and such reductions shall be subject to appeal.
<br>(g) Provisions of services
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that housing assisted under this section provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the category or categories of elderly persons (including frail elderly persons) occupying such housing. Such services may include (A) meal service adequate to meet nutritional need; (B) housekeeping aid; (C) personal assistance; (D) transportation services; (E) health-related services; (F) providing education and outreach regarding telemarketing fraud, in accordance with the standards issued under section 671(f) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13631(f)); and (G) such other services as the Secretary deems essential for maintaining independent living. The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.
<br>(2) Local coordination of services
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall ensure that owners have the managerial capacity to—
<br>
<br>(A) assess on an ongoing basis the service needs of residents;
<br>
<br>(B) coordinate the provision of supportive services and tailor such services to the individual needs of residents; and
<br>
<br>(C) seek on a continuous basis new sources of assistance to ensure the long-term provision of supportive services.
<br>
<br>Any cost associated with this subsection shall be an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2).
<br>(3) Service coordinators
<br>
<br>Any cost associated with employing or otherwise retaining a service coordinator in housing assisted under this section shall be considered an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2). If a project is receiving congregate housing services assistance under section 8011 of title 42, the amount of costs provided under subsection (c)(2) for the project service coordinator may not exceed the additional amount necessary to cover the costs of providing for the coordination of services for residents of the project who are not eligible residents under such section 8011 of title 42. To the extent that amounts are available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) for the costs of carrying out this paragraph within a project, an owner of housing assisted under this section shall provide a service coordinator for the housing to coordinate the provision of services under this subsection within the housing.
<br>(h) Development cost limitations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall periodically establish reasonable development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for the elderly by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect—
<br>
<br>(A) the cost of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for the elderly that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes;
<br>
<br>(B) the cost of movables necessary to the basic operation of the housing, as determined by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(C) the cost of special design features necessary to make the housing accessible to elderly persons;
<br>
<br>(D) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the physical needs of elderly project residents;
<br>
<br>(E) the cost of congregate space necessary to accommodate the provision of supportive services to elderly project residents;
<br>
<br>(F) if the housing is newly constructed, the cost of meeting the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of title 42; and
<br>
<br>(G) the cost of land, including necessary site improvement.
<br>
<br>In establishing development cost limitations for a given market area under this subsection, the Secretary shall use data that reflect currently prevailing costs of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, and land acquisition in the area. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "congregate space" shall include space for cafeterias or dining halls, community rooms or buildings, workshops, adult day health facilities, or other outpatient health facilities, or other essential service facilities. Neither this section nor any other provision of law may be construed as prohibiting or preventing the location and operation, in a project assisted under this section, of commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and the community in which the project is located, except that assistance made available under this section may not be used to subsidize any such commercial facility.
<br>(2) Acquisition
<br>
<br>In the case of existing housing and related facilities to be acquired, the cost limitations shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) the cost of acquiring such housing,
<br>
<br>(B) the cost of rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, or improvement, including the moderate rehabilitation thereof, and
<br>
<br>(C) the cost of the land on which the housing and related facilities are located.
<br>(3) Annual adjustments
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall adjust the cost limitation not less than once annually to reflect changes in the general level of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation costs.
<br>(4) Incentives for savings
<br>(A) Special housing account
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall use the development cost limitations established under paragraph (1) or (2) to calculate the amount of financing to be made available to individual owners. Owners which incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of financing shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a special housing account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which—
<br>
<br>(i) exceed the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of title 42;
<br>
<br>(ii) substantially reduce the life-cycle cost of the housing;
<br>
<br>(iii) reduce gross rent requirements; and
<br>
<br>(iv) enhance tenant comfort and convenience.
<br>(B) Uses
<br>
<br>The special housing account established under subparagraph (A) may be used (i) to supplement services provided to residents of the housing or funds set aside for replacement reserves, or (ii) for such other purposes as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(5) Design flexibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, give owners the flexibility to design housing appropriate to their location and proposed resident population within broadly defined parameters.
<br>(6) Use of funds from other sources
<br>
<br>An owner shall be permitted voluntarily to provide funds from sources other than this section for amenities and other features of appropriate design and construction suitable for supportive housing for the elderly if the cost of such amenities is (A) not financed with the advance, and (B) is not taken into account in determining the amount of Federal assistance or of the rent contribution of tenants. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, assistance amounts provided under this section may be treated as amounts not derived from a Federal grant.
<br>(i) Tenant selection
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>An owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that are satisfactory to the Secretary as (A) consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly persons; and (B) reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Such tenant selection procedures shall comply with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle. Owners shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.
<br>(2) Information regarding housing under this section
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide to an appropriate agency in each area (which may be the applicable Area Agency on the Aging) information regarding the availability of housing assisted under this section.
<br>(j) Miscellaneous provisions
<br>(1) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make available appropriate technical assistance to assure that applicants having limited resources, particularly minority applicants, are able to participate more fully in the program carried out under this section.
<br>(2) Civil rights compliance
<br>
<br>Each owner shall certify, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that assistance made available under this section will be conducted and administered in conformity with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.], the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], and other Federal, State, and local laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting equal opportunity.
<br>(3) Owner deposit
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require an owner to deposit an amount not to exceed $25,000 in a special escrow account to assure the owner's commitment to the housing. Such amount shall be used only to cover operating deficits during the first 3 years of operations and shall not be used to cover construction shortfalls or inadequate initial project rental assistance amounts.
<br>(B) Reduction of requirement
<br>
<br>The Secretary may reduce or waive the owner deposit specified under paragraph (1) for individual applicants if the Secretary finds that such waiver or reduction is necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has the capacity to manage and maintain the housing in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall reduce or waive the requirement of the owner deposit under paragraph (1) in the case of a nonprofit applicant that is not affiliated with a national sponsor, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(4) Notice of appeal
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall notify an owner not less than 30 days prior to canceling any reservation of assistance provided under this section. During the 30-day period following the receipt of a notice under the preceding sentence, an owner may appeal the proposed cancellation of loan authority. Such appeal, including review by the Secretary, shall be completed not later than 45 days after the appeal is filed.
<br>(5) Labor
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors in the construction of housing with 12 or more units assisted under this section shall be paid wages at rates not less than the rates prevailing in the locality involved for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction of a similar character, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40.
<br>(B) Exemption
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any individual who—
<br>
<br>(i) performs services for which the individual volunteered;
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) does not receive compensation for such services; or
<br>
<br>(II) is paid expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee for such services; and
<br>
<br>(iii) is not otherwise employed at any time in the construction work.
<br>(6) Access to residual receipts
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall authorize the owner of a project assisted under this section to use any residual receipts held for the project in excess of $500 per unit (or in excess of such other amount prescribed by the Secretary based on the needs of the project) for activities to retrofit and renovate the project described under section 8011(d)(3) of title 42, to provide a service coordinator for the project as described in section 8011(d)(4) of title 42, or to provide supportive services (as such term is defined in section 8011(k) of title 42) to residents of the project. Any owner that uses residual receipts under this paragraph shall submit to the Secretary a report, not less than annually, describing the uses of the residual receipts. In determining the amount of project rental assistance to be provided to a project under subsection (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary may take into consideration the residual receipts held for the project only if, and to the extent that, excess residual receipts are not used under this paragraph.
<br>(7) Compliance with Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
<br>
<br>Each owner shall operate housing assisted under this section in compliance with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle.
<br>(8) Use of project reserves
<br>
<br>Amounts for project reserves for a project assisted under this section may be used for costs, subject to reasonable limitations as the Secretary determines appropriate, for reducing the number of dwelling units in the project.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 100–242, title I, §162(a), Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1856, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(A) housing for nonelderly handicapped families is assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [12 U.S.C. 1701q] and section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f];
<br>
<br>"(B) the housing programs under such sections are designed and implemented primarily to assist rental housing for elderly and nonelderly families and are often inappropriate for dealing with the specialized needs of the physically impaired, the developmentally disabled, and the chronically mentally ill;
<br>
<br>"(C) the development of housing for nonelderly handicapped families under such programs is often more expensive than necessary, thereby reducing the number of such families that can be assisted with available funds;
<br>
<br>"(D) the program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 can continue to provide direct loans to finance group residences and independent apartments for nonelderly handicapped families, but can be made more efficient and less costly by the adoption of standards and procedures applicable only to housing for such families;
<br>
<br>"(E) the cost containment policies currently being implemented in the development of small group homes (i) do not adequately reflect the necessity for building designs to meet the needs of the designated residents; and (ii) do not recognize necessary State and local standards for the operation of such homes;
<br>
<br>"(F) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families is time consuming and unnecessarily costly and, in some areas of the Nation, prevents the development of such housing;
<br>
<br>"(G) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families should be replaced by a more appropriate subsidy mechanism;
<br>
<br>"(H) both elderly and handicapped housing projects assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 will benefit from an increased emphasis on supportive services and a greater use of State and local funds; and
<br>
<br>"(I) an improved program for nonelderly handicapped families will assist in providing shelter and supportive services for mentally ill persons who might otherwise be homeless.
<br>
<br>"(2) The purpose of this section is to improve the direct loan program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 to ensure that such program meets the special housing and related needs of nonelderly handicapped families."

<br>(2) Objections not raised in hearing
<br>
<br>The court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (d)(1) unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of such additional evidence.

<br>(f) Action to collect penalty
