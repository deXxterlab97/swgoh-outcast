<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a proposed procurement for construction, seeks to bundle or consolidate discrete construction projects; or
<br>
<br>(iii) is a solicitation that involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements.
<br>(B) Notice to procurement center representatives
<br>
<br>With respect to proposed procurements described in subparagraph (A), at least 30 days before issuing a solicitation and concurrent with other processing steps required before issuing the solicitation, the contracting agency shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the procurement center representative of the contracting agency (as described in subsection (l)) along with a statement explaining—
<br>
<br>(i) why the proposed procurement cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;
<br>
<br>(ii) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage the participation of small business concerns in a manner consistent with the actual requirements of the Government;
<br>
<br>(iii) why the proposed procurement cannot be offered to increase the likelihood of the participation of small business concerns;
<br>
<br>(iv) in the case of a proposed procurement for construction, why the proposed procurement cannot be offered as separate discrete projects; or
<br>
<br>(v) why the contracting agency has determined that the bundling of contract requirements is necessary and justified.
<br>(C) Alternatives to increase prime contracting opportunities for small business concerns
<br>
<br>If the procurement center representative believes that the proposed procurement will make the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors unlikely, the procurement center representative, within 15 days after receiving the statement described in subparagraph (B), shall recommend to the contracting agency alternative procurement methods for increasing prime contracting opportunities for small business concerns.
<br>(D) Failure to agree on an alternative procurement method
<br>
<br>If the procurement center representative and the contracting agency fail to agree on an alternative procurement method, the Administrator shall submit the matter to the head of the appropriate department or agency for a determination.
<br>(5) Contracts for sale of government property
<br>
<br>With respect to a contract for the sale of Government property, small business concerns shall receive any such contract if, in the determination of the Administrator and the disposal agency, the award of such contract is in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small business concerns.
<br>(6) Sale of electrical power or other property
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Federal Government.
<br>(7) Costs exceeding fair market price
<br>
<br>A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the cost of the contract to the awarding agency exceeds a fair market price.
<br>(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency
<br>
<br>With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.
<br>(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals
<br>
<br>(1) As used in this subsection:
<br>
<br>(A) The term "Committee" means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under section 8502 of title 41.
<br>
<br>(B) The term "public or private organization for the handicapped" has the same meaning given such term in section 632(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) The term "handicapped individual" has the same meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.
<br>
<br>(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 8503 of title 41.
<br>
<br>(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.
<br>
<br>(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.
<br>
<br>(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.
<br>
<br>(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.
<br>(d) Priority
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.
<br>(e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department or agency shall—
<br>
<br>(A) provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and
<br>
<br>(B) invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director access to acquisition plans.
<br>(2) Market research
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.
<br>(B) Factors
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:
<br>
<br>(i) Cost savings.
<br>
<br>(ii) Quality improvements.
<br>
<br>(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.
<br>
<br>(iv) Better terms and conditions.
<br>
<br>(v) Any other benefits.
<br>(C) Reduction of costs not determinative
<br>
<br>The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.
<br>(3) Strategy specifications
<br>
<br>If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:
<br>
<br>(A) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements and a determination that such benefits justify the bundling.
<br>
<br>(B) An identification of any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of contract requirements.
<br>
<br>(C) An assessment of—
<br>
<br>(i) the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the specific actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements.
<br>(4) Contract teaming
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled or consolidated contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small business concern that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors or a joint venture of small business concerns may submit an offer for the performance of the contract.
<br>(B) Evaluation of offers
<br>
<br>The head of the agency shall evaluate an offer described in subparagraph (A) in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors or members of the joint venture as follows:
<br>(i) Teams
<br>
<br>When evaluating an offer of a small business prime contractor that includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities and past performance of the small business prime contractor.
<br>(ii) Joint ventures
<br>
<br>When evaluating an offer of a joint venture of small business concerns, if the joint venture does not demonstrate sufficient capabilities or past performance to be considered for award of a contract opportunity, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each member of the joint venture as the capabilities and past performance of the joint venture.
<br>(C) Status as a small business concern
<br>
<br>Participation of a small business concern in a team or a joint venture under this paragraph shall not affect the status of that concern as a small business concern for any other purpose.
<br>(5) Past performance ratings of joint ventures for small business concerns
<br>
<br>With respect to evaluating an offer for a prime contract made by a small business concern that previously participated in a joint venture with another business concern (whether or not such other business concern was a small business concern), the Administrator shall establish regulations—
<br>
<br>(A) allowing the small business concern to elect to use the past performance of the joint venture if the small business concern has no relevant past performance of its own;
<br>
<br>(B) requiring the small business concern, when making an election under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) to identify to the contracting officer the joint venture of which the small business concern was a member; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to inform the contracting officer what duties and responsibilities the small business concern carried out as part of the joint venture; and
<br>
<br>(C) requiring a contracting officer, if the small business concern makes an election under subparagraph (A), to consider the past performance of the joint venture when evaluating the past performance of the small business concern, giving due consideration to the information provided under subparagraph (B)(ii).
<br>(f) Contracting preference for small business concerns in a major disaster area
<br>(1) Definition
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "disaster area" means the area for which the President has declared a major disaster, during the period of the declaration.
<br>(2) Contracting preference
<br>
<br>An agency shall provide a contracting preference for a small business concern located in a disaster area if the small business concern will perform the work required under the contract in the disaster area.
<br>(3) Credit for meeting contracting goals
<br>
<br>If an agency awards a contract to a small business concern under the circumstances described in paragraph (2), the value of the contract shall be doubled for purposes of determining compliance with the goals for procurement contracts under subsection (g)(1)(A).
<br>(g) Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts
<br>
<br>(1) Governmentwide goals.—
<br>
<br>(A) Establishment.—The President shall annually establish Governmentwide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in accordance with the following:
<br>
<br>(i) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. In meeting this goal, the Government shall ensure the participation of small business concerns from a wide variety of industries and from a broad spectrum of small business concerns within each industry.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Governmentwide goal for participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(v) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(B) Achievement of governmentwide goals.—Each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Small Business Administration and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Governmentwide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Such goals shall separately address prime contract awards and subcontract awards for each category of small business covered.
<br>
<br>(B) Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Contracts excluded from review by procurement center representatives pursuant to subsection (l)(9)(B) shall not be considered when establishing these goals.
<br>
<br>(C) Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy for final determination.
<br>
<br>(D) After establishing goals under this paragraph for a fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall develop a plan for achieving such goals at both the prime contract and the subcontract level, which shall apportion responsibilities among the agency's acquisition executives and officials. In establishing goals under this paragraph, the head of each Federal agency shall make a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts and subcontracts of such agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.
<br>
<br>(E) The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain expanded participation under subparagraph (D), shall consider—
<br>
<br>(i) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and
<br>
<br>(ii) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eligible small business concerns under this section and under the program established under section 637(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(F)(i) Each procurement employee or program manager described in clause (ii) shall communicate to the subordinates of the procurement employee or program manager the importance of achieving goals established under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(ii) A procurement employee or program manager described in this clause is a senior procurement executive, senior program manager, or Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization of a Federal agency having contracting authority.
<br>
<br>(3) First tier subcontracts that are awarded by Management and Operating contractors sponsored by the Department of Energy to small business concerns, small businesses 1 concerns owned and controlled by service disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women, shall be considered toward the annually established agency and Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded.
<br>(h) Reporting on goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns
<br>(1) Agency reports
<br>
<br>At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall submit to the Administrator a report describing—
<br>
<br>(A) the extent of the participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (including service-disabled veterans), qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in the procurement contracts of such agency during such fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(B) whether the agency achieved the goals established for the agency under subsection (g)(2) with respect to such fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(C) any justifications for a failure to achieve such goals; and
<br>
<br>(D) a remediation plan with proposed new practices to better meet such goals, including analysis of factors leading to any failure to achieve such goals.
<br>(2) Reports by Administrator
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after receiving a report from each Federal agency under paragraph (1) with respect to a fiscal year, the Administrator shall submit to the President and Congress, and to make available on a public Web site, a report that includes—
<br>
<br>(A) a copy of each report submitted to the Administrator under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) a determination of whether each goal established by the President under subsection (g)(1) for such fiscal year was achieved;
