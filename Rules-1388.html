<br>
<br>(1) shall be provided compensation, benefits, and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as any other employee working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work;
<br>
<br>(2) may be treated as providing services to the tribe or organization if the student provides services for members of the tribe or organization that are approved by the tribe or organization and agreed to by the student even though such services are performed while the student is employed by a Federal, State, or local agency or instrumentality or by a nonprofit or for-profit private institution or organization; and
<br>

<br>(2) Suspension
<br>
<br>The obligation of a student to perform services under a critical area service agreement—

<br>(A) shall be suspended for not more than 18 months if, at the request of the student, the tribe or organization determines that there are no employment opportunities available in any critical service area; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall be suspended if the student ceases to attend an institution of higher education as a consequence of an institutional determination of unsatisfactory performance.
<br>
<br>If, at the end of a period of suspension under subparagraph (A), there are still no employment opportunities available in any critical service area, the student's obligations under the agreement shall terminate. A suspension under subparagraph (B) shall be reviewed by the tribe or organization annually, but may be continued indefinitely.
<br>(d) Pro rata reduction for partial services
