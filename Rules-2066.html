<br>§355. Claims for benefits
<br>(a) Publication of Board's regulations
<br>
<br>Claims for benefits and appeals from determinations with respect thereto shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Board shall prescribe. Each employer shall post and maintain, in places readily accessible to employees in his service, such printed statements concerning such regulations as the Board supplies to him for such purpose, and shall keep available to his employees copies of such printed statements. Such printed statements shall be supplied by the Board to each employer without cost to him.
<br>(b) Findings, hearings, investigations, etc., by Board
<br>
<br>The Board is authorized and directed to make findings of fact with respect to any claim for benefits and to make decisions as to the right of any claimant to benefits. The Board is further authorized to hold such hearings, to conduct such investigations and other proceedings, and to establish, by regulations or otherwise, such procedures as it may deem necessary or proper for the determination of a right to benefits. When a claim for benefits is filed with the Board, the Board shall provide notice of such claim to the claimant's base-year employer or employers and afford such employer or employers an opportunity to submit information relevant to the claim before making an initial determination on the claim. When the Board initially determines to pay benefits to a claimant under this chapter, the Board shall provide notice of such determination to the claimant's base-year employer or employers.
<br>(c) Hearing and review of decisions on claims
<br>
<br>(1) Each qualified employee whose claim for benefits has been denied in whole or in part upon an initial determination with respect thereto upon a basis other than one which is reviewable pursuant to one of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing thereon before a referee or such other reviewing body as the Board may establish or assign thereto. In any such case the Board or the person or reviewing body so established or assigned shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the hearing and of the time and place of the hearing.
<br>
<br>(2) Any claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied in an initial determination with respect thereto upon the basis of his not being a qualified employee, and any claimant who contends that under an initial determination of his claim he has been awarded benefits at less than the proper rate, may appeal to the Board for the review of such determination. Thereupon the Board shall review the determination and for such review may designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and to report to the Board thereon together with recommendations. In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the appeals provided for in this paragraph and for decisions upon such appeal.
<br>
<br>(3) Any base-year employer of a claimant whose claim for benefits has been granted in whole or in part, either in an initial determination with respect thereto or in a determination after a hearing pursuant to paragraph (1), and who contends that the determination is erroneous for a reason or reasons other than a reason that is reviewable under paragraph (4), may appeal to the Board for review of such determination. Despite such an appeal, the benefits awarded shall be paid to such claimant, subject to recovery by the Board if and to the extent found on the appeal to have been erroneously awarded. The Board shall take such action as is appropriate to recover the amount of such benefits including if feasible adjustment in subsequent payments pursuant to the first two paragraphs of section 352(d) of this title. Upon an appeal, the Board shall review the determination appealed from and for such review may designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and report to the Board thereof together with recommendations. In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the appeals provided for in this paragraph and for decisions upon such appeal.
<br>
<br>(4) In any case in which benefits are awarded to a claimant in whole or in part upon the basis of pay earned in the service of a person or company found by the Board to be an employer as defined in this chapter but which denies that it is such an employer, such benefits awarded on such basis shall be paid to such claimant subject to a right of recovery of such benefits. The Board shall thereupon designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and to report to the Board on whether such benefits should be repaid. The Board may also designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and report to the Board whether or not any person or company is entitled to a refund of contributions or should be required to pay contributions under this chapter, regardless of whether or not any claims for benefits will have been filed upon the basis of service in the employ of such person or company, and shall follow such procedure if contributions are assessed and payment is refused or payment is made and a refund claimed upon the basis that such person or company is or will not have been liable for such contributions. In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the proceedings provided for in this paragraph and for decisions upon such proceedings.
<br>
<br>(5) Final decision of the Board in the cases provided for in the preceding three paragraphs shall be communicated to the claimant and to the other interested parties within fifteen days after it is made. Any properly interested party notified, as hereinabove provided, of his right to participate in the proceedings may obtain a review of any such decision by which he claims to be aggrieved or the determination of any issue therein in the manner provided in subsection (f) of this section with respect to the review of the Board's decisions upon claims for benefits and subject to all provisions of law applicable to the review of such decisions. Subject only to such review, the decision of the Board upon all issues determined in such decision shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and shall conclusively establish all rights and obligations, arising under this chapter, of every party notified as hereinabove provided of his right to participate in the proceedings.
<br>
<br>(6) For purposes of this subsection and subsections (d) and (f), any base-year employer of the claimant is a properly interested party.
<br>
<br>(7) Any issue determinable pursuant to this subsection and subsection (f) of this section shall not be determined in any manner other than pursuant to this subsection and subsection (f).
<br>(d) Decisions of reviewing bodies; review and finality
<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the filing of cases with and the decision of cases by reviewing bodies, and the review of such decisions. The Board may provide for intermediate reviews of such decisions by such bodies as the Board may establish or assign thereto. The Board may (i) on its own motion review a decision of an intermediate reviewing body on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such case, and may direct the taking of additional evidence, or (ii) permit such parties as it finds properly interested in the proceedings to take appeals to the Board. Unless a review or an appeal is had pursuant to this subsection, the decision of an intermediate reviewing body shall, subject to such regulations as the Board may prescribe, be deemed to be the final decision of the Board.
<br>(e) Application of rules of evidence in law and equity; notice of findings
<br>
<br>In any proceeding other than a court proceeding, the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling, but a full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings and testimony, and the Board's final determination, together with its findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection therewith, shall be communicated to the parties within fifteen days after the date of such final determination.
<br>(f) Review of final decision of Board by Courts of Appeals; costs
<br>
<br>Any claimant, or any railway labor organization organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], of which claimant is a member, or any base-year employer of the claimant, or any other party aggrieved by a final decision under subsection (c) of this section, may, only after all administrative remedies within the Board will have been availed of and exhausted, obtain a review of any final decision of the Board by filing a petition for review within ninety days after the mailing of notice of such decision to the claimant or other party, or within such further time as the Board may allow, in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant or other party resides or will have had his principal place of business or principal executive office, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A copy of such petition, together with initial process, shall forth-with be served upon the Board or any officer designated by it for such purpose. A copy of such petition also shall forthwith be served upon any other properly interested party, and such party shall be a party to the review proceeding. Service may be made upon the Board by registered mail addressed to the Chairman. Within thirty days after receipt of service, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Board shall file with the court in which such petition has been filed the record upon which the findings and decision complained of are based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein. It shall have power to enter a decree affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Board, with or without remanding the cause for rehearing. The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. No additional evidence shall be received by the court but the court may order additional evidence to be taken before the Board, and the Board may, after hearing such additional evidence, modify its findings of fact and conclusions and file such additional or modified findings and conclusions with the court, and the Board shall file with the court the additional record. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, subject to review as in equity cases.
<br>
<br>An applicant for review of a final decision of the Board concerning a claim for benefits shall not be liable for costs, including costs of service, or costs of printing records, except that costs may be assessed by the court against such applicant if the court determines that the proceedings for such review have been instituted or continued without reasonable ground.
<br>(g) Finality of Board decisions
<br>
<br>Findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Board in the determination of any claim for benefits or refund, the determination of any other matter pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and the determination of the Board that the unexpended funds in the account are available for the payment of any claim for benefits or refund under this chapter, shall be, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons, including the Comptroller General and any other administrative or accounting officer, employee, or agent of the United States, and shall not be subject to review in any manner other than that set forth in subsection (f) of this section.
<br>(h) Benefits payable prior to final decision of Board
<br>
<br>Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations of the Board, benefits payable with respect to any period prior to the date of a final decision of the Board with respect to a claim therefor, shall be paid only after such final decision.
<br>(i) Fees for presenting claims; penalties
<br>
<br>No claimant or other properly interested person claiming benefits shall be charged fees of any kind by the Board, its employees or representatives, with respect to such claim. Any such claimant or other properly interested person may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent, in any proceeding before the Board or its representatives or a court, but no such counsel or agent for a claimant shall either charge or receive for such services more than an amount approved by the Board or by the court before whom the proceedings of the Board are reviewed. Any person who violates any provision of this subsection shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year.

<br>§358. Contributions
<br>(a) Employer contribution
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) General rule
<br>(i) Contribution rate generally
<br>
<br>Every employer shall pay a contribution, with respect to having employees in his service, equal to the percentage determined under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), whichever is applicable, of so much of the compensation paid in any calendar month by such employer to any employee as is not in excess of the monthly compensation base for that month as computed under section 351(i) of this title.
<br>(ii) Multiple employer limitation
<br>
<br>If compensation is paid to an employee by more than one employer in any calendar month—
<br>
<br>(I) the contributions required by this subsection shall not apply to any amount of the aggregate compensation paid to such employee by all such employers in such calendar month which is in excess of such monthly compensation base; and
<br>
<br>(II) each employer (other than a subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer) shall be liable for that portion of the contribution with respect to such compensation paid by all such employers which the compensation paid by him to such employee bears to the total compensation paid in such month by all such employers to such employee.
<br>
<br> In the event that the compensation paid by such employers to the employee in such month is less than such monthly compensation base, each subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer shall be liable for such portion of any additional contribution as the compensation paid by such employer to such employee in such month bears to the total compensation paid by all such employers to such employee in such month.
<br>(B) Transitional rule
<br>(i) 1st, 2d, and 3d calendar years
<br>
<br>Except as provided in clause (vi), with respect to compensation paid in calendar years 1988, 1989, and 1990, the contribution rate shall be 8 percent.
<br>(ii) 4th calendar year
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in calendar year 1991, the contribution rate shall be the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(I) the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20); or
<br>
<br>(II) the percentage computed pursuant to the following formula:
<br>   	 	 	 
<br>  	  	2A+B 	
<br>  	R= 	———— 	
<br>  	  	3 	
<br>(iii) 5th calendar year
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in calendar year 1992, the contribution rate shall be the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(I) the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20); or
<br>
<br>(II) the percentage computed pursuant to the following formula:
<br>   	 	 	 
<br>  	  	A+2C 	
<br>  	R= 	———— 	
<br>  	  	3 	
<br>(iv) Meaning of symbols
<br>
<br>For purposes of the formulas in clauses (ii) and (iii)—
<br>
<br>(I) "R" is the applicable contribution rate expressed as a percentage for months in the calendar year;
<br>
<br>(II) "A" is the contribution rate determined under clause (i);
<br>
<br>(III) "B" is the percentage rate for the employer, as determined under subparagraph (C), for calendar year 1991; and
<br>
<br>(IV) "C" is the percentage rate for the employer, as determined under subparagraph (C), for calendar year 1992.
<br>(v) Special rule for certain computations
<br>
<br>For purposes of computing B and C in such formulas—
<br>
<br>(I) the percentage rate computed under subparagraph (C), if more than the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20) shall not be reduced to that limit; and
<br>
<br>(II) any computations which under subparagraph (C) are to be made on the basis of a 4-quarter or a 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a period beginning on January 1, 1990, and ending on that June 30, and the amount so computed shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so computed as 4 or 12, as appropriate, bears to the number of calendar quarters in the period on which the computation was based.
<br>(vi) Special transition rule for public commuter railroads
<br>
<br>With respect to each of calendar years 1989 and 1990, the contribution of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and an employer which on November 10, 1988, is a publicly funded and publicly operated carrier providing rail commuter service shall be equal to the amount of benefits attributable to such carrier, plus an amount equal to 0.65 percent of the total compensation paid by that employer in that year on which that employer's contribution would be based under clause (i) if such employer's contribution were determined under that clause.
<br>(C) Experience-rated contributions
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in a calendar year that begins after December 31, 1992, the contribution rate for each employer shall be determined as follows:
<br>(i) Step 1
<br>
<br>Compute the employer's benefit ratio as of the preceding June 30 to 4 decimal points in accordance with paragraph (2).
<br>(ii) Step 2
<br>
<br>Subtract the employer's reserve ratio as of the preceding June 30 as computed to 4 decimal points in accordance with paragraph (4).
<br>(iii) Step 3
<br>
<br>Subtract the pooled credit ratio for the calendar year, if any, as computed to 4 decimal points in accordance with paragraph (12).
<br>(iv) Step 4
<br>
<br>Multiply by 100 the total arrived at under the steps set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) so as to obtain a percentage rate, which shall be rounded to the nearest 100th of 1 percent. If the total arrived at under such steps is 0 or less than 0, the percentage rate as so computed shall be 0.
<br>(v) Step 5
<br>
<br>Add 0.65 to the percentage rate arrived at under clause (iv), representing the portion of the employer's contribution which is to be deposited to the credit of the fund under subsection (i).
<br>(vi) Step 6
<br>
<br>Add the surcharge rate for the calendar year, if any, as computed under paragraph (14).
<br>(vii) Step 7
<br>
<br>Add the pooled charge ratio for the calendar year, if any, as computed to 4 decimal points under paragraph (13) and multiplied by 100.
<br>(viii) Step 8
<br>
<br>Reduce the precentage 1 rate computed in accordance with the preceding steps to the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20), if such rate is higher than such limit. The rate computed in accordance with the preceding steps, after any reduction under this clause, is the contribution rate.
<br>(D) New-employer contribution rates
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), the contribution rate applicable to a new employer who does not become subject to this chapter until after December 31, 1989, shall be determined as follows:
<br>(i) 1st calendar year
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in calendar months before the end of the first full calendar year in which the employer is subject to this chapter, the contribution rate shall be the average contribution rate paid by all employers during the 3 calendar years preceding the calendar year before the calendar year in which the compensation is paid. The average contribution rate shall be determined—
<br>
<br>(I) by dividing the aggregate contributions paid by all employers under this subsection in those 3 calendar years by the aggregate compensation with respect to which such contributions were paid; and
<br>
<br>(II) by multiplying the resulting ratio as computed to 4 decimal points by 100.
<br>(ii) 2d calendar year
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in calendar months in the next calendar year, the contribution rate shall be the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(I) the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20); or
<br>
<br>(II) the percentage rate computed pursuant to the following formula:
<br>   	 	 	 	 	 
<br>  	  	  	2(A2)+B 		
<br>  	R= 	( 	————— 	) 	
<br>  	  	  	3 		
<br>(iii) 3d calendar year
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid in calendar months in the third full calendar year in which the employer is subject to the coverage of this chapter, the contribution rate shall be the smaller of—
<br>
<br>(I) the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20); or
<br>
<br>(II) the percentage rate computed pursuant to the following formula:
<br>   	 	 	 
<br>  	  	A3+2C 	
<br>  	R= 	———— 	
<br>  	  	3 	
<br>(iv) Subsequent calendar years
<br>
<br>With respect to all calendar months in calendar years subsequent to that calendar year, the contribution rate shall be determined under subparagraph (C).
<br>(v) Meaning of symbols
<br>
<br>For purposes of the formulas in clauses (ii) and (iii)—
<br>
<br>(I) "R" is the applicable contribution rate expressed as a percentage for months in the calendar year;
<br>
<br>(II) "A1" is the contribution rate determined under clause (i) for such employer's first full calendar year;
<br>
<br>(III) "A2" is the contribution rate which would have been determined under clause (i) if the employer's second calendar year had been its first full calendar year;
<br>
<br>(IV) "A3" is the contribution rate which would have been determined under clause (i) if the employer's third calendar year had been such employer's first full calendar year;
<br>
<br>(V) "B" is the contribution rate for the employer as determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer's second full calendar year; and
<br>
<br>(VI) "C" is the contribution rate for the employer as determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer's third full calendar year.
<br>(vi) Special rule for certain computations
<br>
<br>For purposes of computing B and C in such formulas—
<br>
<br>(I) the percentage rate computed under subparagraph (C), shall not be reduced under clause (viii) of that subparagraph; and
<br>
<br>(II) any computations which under subparagraph (C) are to be made on the basis of a 4-quarter or 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a period commencing with the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins after the date on which the employer first commenced paying compensation subject to this chapter and ending on that June 30, and the amount so computed shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so computed as 4 or 12, as appropriate, bears to the number of calendar quarters in the period on which the computation was based.
<br>(2) Benefit ratio
<br>
<br>An employer's benefit ratio as of any given June 30 shall be determined by dividing all benefits charged to the employer under paragraph (15) during the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30 by the employer's 3-year compensation base as of such June 30 as computed under paragraph (3).
<br>(3) 3-year compensation base
<br>
<br>An employer's 3-year compensation base as of any given June 30 is the aggregate compensation with respect to which contributions were paid by the employer under this subsection in the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30.
<br>(4) Reserve ratio
<br>
<br>An employer's reserve ratio as of any given June 30 shall be computed by dividing the employer's reserve balance as of such June 30, as computed under paragraph (6), by that employer's 1-year compensation base as of such June 30, as computed under paragraph (5). The employer's reserve ratio may be either a positive or a negative figure, depending upon whether the employer's reserve balance is a positive or negative figure.
<br>(5) 1-year compensation base
<br>
<br>An employer's 1-year compensation base as of any given June 30 is the aggregate compensation with respect to which contributions were paid by the employer under this subsection in the 4 calendar quarters ending on such June 30.
<br>(6) Reserve balance
<br>
<br>An employer's reserve balance as of any given June 30 shall be determined by subtracting the employer's cumulative benefit balance as of such June 30, computed under paragraph (7), from the employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of such June 30, computed under paragraph (8). An employer's reserve balance may be either positive or negative, depending upon whether or not that employer's net cumulative contribution balance exceeds the employer's cumulative benefit balance.
<br>(7) Cumulative benefit balance
<br>
<br>An employer's cumulative benefit balance as of any given June 30 shall be determined by adding—
<br>
<br>(A) the net amount of the benefits charged to the employer under paragraph (15) on or after January 1, 1990; and
<br>
<br>(B) the cumulative amount of the employer's unallocated charges for the same period, if any, as computed under paragraph (9).
<br>(8) Net cumulative contribution balance
<br>
<br>An employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of any given June 30 shall be determined as follows:
<br>(A) Step 1
<br>
<br>Compute the sum of
<br>
<br>(i) all contributions paid by the employer pursuant to this subsection;
<br>
<br>(ii) that portion of the tax imposed under section 3321(a) of title 26 that is attributable to the surtax rate under section 516(b) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Retirement Improvement Act of 1988; 2 and
<br>
<br>(iii) any taxes paid by the employer pursuant to section 3321(a) of title 26 (after the outstanding balance of loans made under section 360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, plus interest, have been paid);
<br>
<br>on or after January 1, 1990.
<br>(B) Step 2
<br>
<br>Subtract an amount equal to the amount of such contributions deposited to the credit of the fund under subsection (i).
<br>(C) Step 3
<br>
<br>Add an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which such contributions were reduced in prior calendar years as a result of pooled credits, if any, under paragraph (1)(C)(iii).
<br>(9) Unallocated charge
<br>
<br>An employer's unallocated charge as of any given June 30 is the amount that as of such June 30 bears the same ratio to the system unallocated charge balance, computed under paragraph (10), as the employer's 1-year compensation base, computed under paragraph (5), bears to the system compensation base computed under paragraph (11).
<br>(10) System unallocated charge balance
<br>
<br>The system unallocated charge balance as of any given June 30 shall be determined as follows:
<br>(A) Step 1
<br>
<br>Compute the aggregate amount of all interest paid by the account on loans from the Railroad Retirement Account after September 30, 1985, pursuant to section 360(d) of this title, during the 4 calendar quarters ending on that June 30.
<br>(B) Step 2
<br>
<br>Add the aggregate amount of any additions to the system unallocated charge balance specified in paragraphs (15) and (16), during that period.
<br>(C) Step 3
<br>
<br>Add the aggregate amount of any other expenditures by the account during that period not chargeable to any individual employer under paragraph (15) or to the fund under section 361 of this title.
<br>(D) Step 4
<br>
<br>Subtract the aggregate amount of all income to the account, under section 360(a)(iv) of this title or section 360(a)(vii) of this title, during that period.
<br>(E) Step 5
<br>
<br>Subtract the aggregate amount of all transfers to the account, pursuant to section 361(d) of this title, during that period.
<br>(F) Step 6
<br>
<br>Subtract the aggregate amount of all other income and receipts of the account, during that period, which are not assigned to individual employer balances.
<br>(G) Step 7
<br>
<br>Subtract the net cumulative contribution balance of each employer whose balance has been cancelled pursuant to paragraph (16), during that period, calculated as of the date of such cancellation.
<br>(11) System compensation base
<br>
<br>The system compensation base as of any given June 30 shall be determined by adding together the amounts of the 1-year compensation bases of all employers and employee representatives subject to this chapter, computed in accordance with paragraph (5), as of such June 30.
<br>(12) Pooled credit ratio
<br>
<br>The pooled credit ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be determined as follows:
<br>(A) Step 1
<br>
<br>Compute the balance to the credit of the account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30, including any amounts in the account attributable to loans made under section 360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, but disregarding the obligation to repay such loans and interest thereon. In determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund as of the close of business on such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will be a pooled credit ratio for the calendar year only if that balance is in excess of the greater of $250,000,000 or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $250,000,000 as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (11).
<br>(B) Step 2
<br>
<br>If there is such an excess amount, divide that excess amount by the system compensation base as of the June 30 preceding the calendar year. The result is the pooled credit ratio for the calendar year.
<br>(13) Pooled charge ratio
<br>
<br>The pooled charge ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be determined as follows:
<br>(A) Step 1
<br>
<br>With respect to each employer whose contribution rate for that calendar year as computed through step 6 under paragraph (1)(C) was greater than the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20), multiply the employer's 1-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30, as computed in accordance with paragraph (5), by the difference between—
<br>
<br>(i) the percentage rate determined under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) before the reduction to the maximum contribution limit; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the maximum contribution limit.
<br>(B) Step 2
<br>
<br>Add the amounts arrived at under step 1 so as to obtain an aggregate amount for all such employers.
<br>(C) Step 3
<br>
<br>For each employer whose contribution rate as computed through step 3 under paragraph (1)(C) was less than 0, the percentage rate by which such employer's rate was raised in order to bring that rate to 0 shall be multiplied by that employer's 1-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30. Subtract the total of the amounts computed under the preceding sentence for all employers from the amount arrived at in step 2.
<br>(D) Step 4
<br>
<br>Divide the aggregate amount arrived at under step 3 by the system compensation base as of the preceding June 30 as computed under paragraph (11) minus the one-year compensation base of those employers whose rates computed through step 6 of paragraph (1)(C) exceeded the maximum contribution rate computed under paragraph (20). The result is the pooled charge ratio for the calendar year.
<br>(14) Surcharge rate
<br>
<br>The surcharge rate for a calendar year, if any, shall be determined as follows:
<br>(A) Step 1
<br>
<br>Compute the balance to the credit of the account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30, including any amounts in the account attributable to loans made under section 360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, but disregarding the obligation to repay such loans and interest thereon. In determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund as of the close of business on such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will be a surcharge rate for the calendar year only if that balance is less than the greater of $100,000,000 or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $100,000,000 as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (11).
<br>(B) Step 2
<br>
<br>(i) If the balance to the credit of the account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in the 2nd sentence of step 1 but is equal to or more than the greater of $50,000,000 or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $50,000,000 as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 1.5 percent.
<br>
<br>(ii) If the balance to the credit of the account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in the clause (i), but greater than or equal to zero, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 2.5 percent.
<br>
<br>(iii) If the balance to the credit of the account is less than zero, the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 3.5 percent.
<br>(15) Chargeable benefits
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Beginning January 1, 1990, all benefits paid to an employee for days of unemployment or days of sickness shall be charged to that employee's base year employer by adding amounts equal to the amounts of such benefits to the employer's cumulative benefit balance except that benefits paid by reason of strikes or work stoppages growing out of labor disputes shall not be added to the employer's cumulative benefit balance but instead shall be added to the system unallocated charge balance.
<br>(B) Adjustments
<br>
<br>A sum equal to each amount realized in recovery for overpayment, erroneous payment, or reimbursement of benefits and credited to the account pursuant to section 360(a)(v) or 360(a)(viii) of this title shall be subtracted from the cumulative benefit balances of the employers of the employees to whom such an amount was paid as a benefit in the proportion to the amount by which each such employer's cumulative benefit balance was increased as a result of the payment of the benefit.
<br>(C) Multiple employers
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>All benefits paid to an employee who had more than 1 base-year employer shall be charged to the cumulative benefit balances of the employee's base year employers—
<br>
<br>(I) in reverse chronological order of the employee's employment with each such employer in the base year if the employer at the time of the claim was the last base year employer, and the amount charged to each employer shall not exceed the compensation paid by that employer to the employee in the base year; and
<br>
<br>(II) in all other cases, in the same ratio as the compensation paid to such employee by the employer bears to the total of such compensation paid to such employees by all such employers in the base year.
<br>(ii) Special rule for employer with cancelled balances
<br>
<br>All benefits chargeable under this subparagraph to an employer for which the Board has cancelled balances under paragraph (16) shall be added to the system unallocated charge balance.
<br>(16) Defunct employer
<br>
<br>Whenever the Board determines, pursuant to such regulations as the Board may prescribe, that an employer has permanently ceased to pay compensation with respect to which contributions are payable pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall, effective on the date of the Board's determination, transfer the employer's net cumulative contribution balance as a subtraction from, and cumulative benefit balance as an addition to, the system unallocated charge balance and cancel all other accumulations of the employer.
<br>(17) Individual employer record
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>As of January 1, 1990, the Board shall commence maintaining an individual employer record with respect to each employer, and the records necessary to determine pooled charges, pooled credits and unallocated charge balances for the system. Whenever a new employer begins paying compensation with respect to which contributions are payable pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall establish and maintain an individual employer record for such employer.
<br>(B) Definition
<br>
<br>As used in this paragraph, the term "individual employer record" means a record of an individual employer's benefit ratio, reserve ratio, 1-year compensation base, 3-year compensation base, unallocated charge, reserve balance, net cumulative contribution balance, and cumulative benefit balance.
<br>(18) Joint employer records
<br>
<br>Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Board, the Board may allow 2 or more employers, upon application, to establish and maintain, or to discontinue, a joint individual employer record for such employers as though such joint record constituted a single employer's individual employer record.
<br>(19) Mergers, consolidations, or other changes in employer identity
<br>(A) With other employers
<br>
<br>In the event of a merger, consolidation, unification, or reorganization in which an employer combines with another employer and the combination entails no partitioning of the property of the employer, the individual employer records of the 2 employers shall be combined into a joint individual employer record if the parties request such joint treatment pursuant to paragraph (18) or if the Board otherwise determines, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Board, that such joint treatment is desirable.
<br>(B) With nonemployers
<br>
<br>In the event of a merger, consolidation, unification, or reorganization in which an employer combines with another entity that is not an employer, the employer's individual employer record shall attach to the combined entity.
<br>(C) Sale of assets
<br>
<br>In the event property of an employer is sold or transferred to another employer or other entity, or is partitioned among 2 or more employers or entities, the cumulative benefit balance, net cumulative contribution balance, 1-year compensation base, and 3-year compensation base of the employer shall be prorated among the employers which receive the property, including any entities which become employers by virtue of such transfer or partition, in such equitable manner as the Board by regulation shall prescribe.
<br>(D) Reincorporation
<br>
<br>The cumulative benefit balance, net cumulative contribution balance, 1-year compensation base, and 3-year compensation base of an employer that reincorporates or otherwise alters its corporate identity in a transaction not involving a merger, consolidation, or unification shall attach to the reincorporated or altered entity.
<br>(E) Abandonment
<br>
<br>If an employer abandons property or discontinues service but continues to operate as an employer, the employer's individual employer record shall continue to be calculated as provided in this subsection without retroactive adjustment.
<br>(20) Maximum contribution limit
<br>
<br>The maximum contribution limit with respect to a calendar year is 12 percent, unless a 3.5 percent surcharge under paragraph (14) is in effect with respect to that calendar year. If such a surcharge is in effect the maximum contribution limit with respect to that calendar year is 12.5 percent.
<br>(21) Special rules for certain computations under paragraph (1)(C)
<br>
<br>(A) Any computation that is to be made under paragraph (1)(C) on the basis of a 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on the later of—
<br>
<br>(I) January 1, 1990;
<br>
<br>(II) the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins after the date on which the employer first began to pay compensation subject to this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(III) July 1 of the third calendar year preceding that June 30; and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending on that June 30.
<br>
<br>(B) The amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so computed as 12 bears to the number of calendar quarters on which the computation is based.
<br>(b) Employee representative contribution
<br>
<br>Each employee representative shall pay a contribution with respect to so much of the compensation paid to him for services performed as an employee representative as is not in excess of the monthly compensation base computed in accordance with section 351(i) of this title, at a rate which shall be determined under subsection (a) in the same manner and with the same effect as if the employee organization by which such employee representative is employed were an employer as defined in this chapter.
<br>(c) Board proclamation of balance
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than October 15, 1990, and October 15 of each year thereafter the Board shall proclaim—
<br>
<br>(A) the balance to the credit of the account as of the preceding June 30 for purposes of paragraphs (12) and (14) of subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(B) the balance of any advances to the account under section 360(d) of this title after September 30, 1985, that has not been repaid with interest as provided in such section as of September 30 of that year;
<br>
<br>(C) the system compensation base as of that June 30 as computed in accordance with paragraph (11) of that subsection;
<br>
<br>(D) the system unallocated charge balance as of that June 30, as computed in accordance with paragraph (10) of that subsection; and
<br>
<br>(E) the pooled credit ratio, the pooled charge ratio, and the surcharge rate, if any, as determined under paragraph (12), (13), or (14) of that subsection and applicable in the following calendar year.
<br>(2) Publication of notice
<br>
<br>As soon as is practicable after such proclamation, the Board shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the amounts so determined and proclaimed.
<br>(d) Notifications by Board
<br>
<br>(1) Not later than the last day of any calendar quarter that begins after March 31, 1990, the Board shall notify each employer and employee representative of its net cumulative contribution balance and cumulative benefit balance as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter, as computed in accordance with paragraphs (7) and (8) of subsection (a) as of the last day of such preceding calendar quarter rather than as of a given June 30 if such last day is not a June 30.
<br>
<br>(2) Not later than October 15, 1990, and October 15 of each year thereafter, the Board shall notify each employer and employee representative of its benefit ratio, reserve ratio, 1-year compensation base, 3-year compensation base, unallocated charge, and reserve balance as of the preceding June 30 as computed in accordance with paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (9) of subsection (a), and of the contribution rate applicable to the employer or employee representative in the following calendar year as computed under paragraphs (1)(B), (C), or (D) of that subsection.
<br>(e) Information to verify accuracy to be made available
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by an employer or employee representative, the Board shall make available to such employer or employee representative any information available to the Board which may be necessary to verify the accuracy of a contribution rate determined by the Board to be applicable to such employer or employee representative, or of any component of that contribution rate including the accuracy of the employer's individual employer record, upon payment by such employer or employee representative to the Board of the cost incurred by the Board in making such information available. The amounts so paid to the Board shall be credited to and deposited in the fund.
<br>(f) Fractional parts of a cent
<br>
<br>In the payment of any contribution under this chapter, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to one cent.
<br>(g) Adjustments for improper payments
<br>
<br>If more or less than the correct amount of the contribution required by this section is paid with respect to any compensation, then, under regulations prescribed under this chapter by the Board, proper adjustments with respect to the contribution shall be made, without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution payments made under this chapter by the same employer or employee representative.
<br>(h) Refunding overpayment; collecting underpayment
<br>
<br>If more or less than the correct amount of the contribution required by this section is paid with respect to any compensation and the overpayment or underpayment of the contribution cannot be adjusted under subsection (d) of this section, the amount of the overpayment shall be refunded from the account, or the amount of the underpayment shall be collected, in such manner and at such times (subject to the statute of limitations properly applicable thereto) as may be prescribed by regulations of the Board.
<br>(i) Collection and deposit of contributions
<br>
<br>The contributions required by this chapter shall be collected by the Board and shall be deposited by it with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, such part thereof as equals 0.65 per centum of the total compensation on which such contributions are based to be deposited to the credit of the fund and the balance to be deposited to the credit of the account.
<br>(j) Time for payment; failure to pay promptly
<br>
<br>The contributions required by this chapter shall be collected and paid quarterly or at such other times and in such manner and under such conditions not inconsistent with this chapter as may be prescribed by regulations of the Board, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the compensation of employees in the employer's employ. If a contribution required by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added to the amount payable (except in the case of adjustments made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter) interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month or fraction of a month from the date the contribution became due until paid. Any interest collected pursuant to this subsection shall be credited to the account.
<br>(k) Application of other laws; authority of Board
<br>
<br>All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable with respect to any tax imposed by the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.], insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, shall be applicable with respect to the contributions required by this chapter: Provided, That all authority and functions conferred by or pursuant to such provisions upon any officer or employee of the United States, except the authority to institute and prosecute, and the function of instituting and prosecuting, criminal proceedings, shall, with respect to such contributions, be vested in and exercised by the Board or such officers and employees of the Board as it may designate therefor.

<br>§360. Railroad unemployment insurance account
<br>(a) Funds constituting account; availability for benefits or refunds
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 1104 of title 42 an account to be known as the railroad unemployment insurance account. This account shall consist of (i) such part of all contributions collected pursuant to section 358 of this title as is in excess of 0.65 per centum of the total compensation on which such contributions are based, together with all interest collected pursuant to section 358(g) 1 of this title; (ii) all amounts transferred or paid into the account pursuant to section 363 or section 364 of this title; (iii) all additional amounts appropriated to the account in accordance with any provision of this chapter or with any provision of law now or hereafter adopted; (iv) a proportionate part of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, computed in accordance with the provisions of section 1104(e) of title 42; (v) all amounts realized in recoveries for overpayments or erroneous payments of benefits; (vi) all amounts transferred thereto pursuant to section 361 of this title; (vii) all fines or penalties collected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; and (viii) all amounts credited thereto pursuant to section 352(f) or section 362(g) of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all moneys credited to the account shall be mingled and undivided, and are permanently appropriated to the Board to be continuously available to the Board without further appropriation, for the payment of benefits and refunds under this chapter, and no part thereof shall lapse at any time, or be carried to the surplus fund or any other fund.
<br>(b) Payment of benefits or refunds
<br>
<br>All moneys in the account shall be used solely for the payment of the benefits and refunds provided for by this chapter. The Board shall, from time to time, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the name and address of each person or company entitled to receive benefits or a refund payment under this chapter, the amount of such payment, and the time at which it shall be made. Prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Department, shall make payments from the account directly to such person or company of the amount of benefits or refund so certified by the Board: Provided, however, That if the Board shall so request, the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Department, shall transmit benefits payments to the Board for distribution by it through employment offices or in such other manner as the Board deems proper.
<br>(c) Annual report to Congress
<br>
<br>The Board shall include in its annual report to Congress a statement with respect to the status and operation of the account.
<br>(d) Transfer and retransfer of funds; interest
<br>
<br>Whenever the Board finds at any time that the balance in the railroad unemployment insurance account will be insufficient to pay the benefits and refunds which it estimates are due, or will become due, under this chapter, it shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account such moneys as the Board estimates would be necessary for the payment of such benefits and refunds, and the Secretary shall make such transfer. Whenever the Board finds that the balance in the railroad unemployment insurance account, without regard to the amounts transferred pursuant to the next preceding sentence, is sufficient to pay such benefits and refunds, it shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the railroad unemployment insurance account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account such moneys as in its judgment are not needed for the payment of such benefits and refunds, plus interest at a rate for each fiscal year equal to the average rate of interest borne by all special obligations held by the Railroad Retirement Account on the last day of the preceding fiscal year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, and the Secretary shall make such retransfer. In determining the balance in the railroad unemployment insurance account as of September 30 of any year pursuant to section 358(a) of this title, any moneys transferred from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account which have not been retransferred as of such date from the latter account to the credit of the former, plus the interest accrued thereon to that date, shall be disregarded.

<br>(a) Maintenance of account; amounts constituting fund
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1104] an account to be known as the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund. This unemployment insurance administration fund shall consist of (i) such part of all contributions collected pursuant to section 358 of this title as equals 0.65 per centum of the total compensation on which such contributions are based; (ii) all amounts advanced to the fund by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section; (iii) all amounts appropriated by subsection (b) of this section; and (iv) such additional amounts as Congress may appropriate for expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter. Such additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated.
<br>(b) Authorization of appropriations; advance of sums; repayment
<br>
<br>In addition to the other moneys herein provided for expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter, there is appropriated to the fund such amount as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate to have been collected or to be collectible with respect to the calendar years 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939, from employers subject to this chapter, under title IX of the Social Security Act, less such amount as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate will be appropriated or has been appropriated to States or Territories pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 24, 1937 (Public, Numbered 353, Seventy-fifth Congress), as proceeds of taxes paid by employers pursuant to title IX of the Social Security Act.
<br>
<br>Until the amount appropriated by this subsection is credited to the fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to advance to the credit of the fund such sums, but not more than $2,000,000, as the Board requests for the purpose of financing the costs of administering this chapter. Such advance shall be repaid from the fund at such time after the amount appropriated by this subsection is credited to the fund as the Board by agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, but not later than January 1, 1940.
<br>(c) Availability for administrative expenses
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all moneys at any time credited to the fund are permanently appropriated to the Board to be continuously available to the Board without further appropriation for any expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter, including personal services in the District of Columbia and elsewhere; travel expenses, including expenses of attendance at meetings when authorized by the Board; actual transportation expenses and not to exceed $10 per diem to cover subsistence and other expenses while in attendance at and en route to and from the place to which he is invited, to any person other than an employee of the Federal Government who may, from time to time, be invited to the city of Washington or elsewhere for conference or advisory purposes in furthering the work of the Board; when found by the Board to be in the interest of the Government, not exceeding 3 per centum, in any fiscal year, of the amounts credited during such year to the fund, for engaging persons or organizations, by contract or otherwise, for any special technical or professional services, determined necessary by the Board, including but not restricted to accounting, actuarial, statistical, and reporting services, without regard to section 6101 of title 41 and the provisions of other laws applicable to the employment and compensation of officers and employees of the United States; services; advertising, postage, telephone, telegraph, teletype, and other communication services and tolls; supplies; reproducing, photographing, and all other equipment, office appliances, and laborsaving devices, including devices for internal communication and conveyance; purchase and exchange, operation, maintenance and repair of motor-propelled passenger-carrying vehicles to be used only for official purposes in the District of Columbia and in the field; printing and binding; purchase and exchange of law books, books of reference, and directories; periodicals, newspapers and press clippings, in such amounts as the Board deems necessary, without regard to the provisions of section 192 of the Revised Statutes; manuscripts and special reports; membership fees or dues in organizations which issue publications to members only, or to members at a lower price than to others, payment for which may be made in advance; rentals, including garages, in the District of Columbia or elsewhere; alterations and repairs; if found by the Board to be necessary to expedite the certification to the Board by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of persons eligible to be employed by the Board, and to the extent that the Board finds such expedition necessary, meeting the expenses of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in holding examinations for testing the fitness of applicants for admission to the classified service for employment by the Board pursuant to the second paragraph of section 362(l) of this title, but not to exceed the additional expenses found by the Board to have been incurred by reason of the holding of such examinations; and miscellaneous items, including those for public instruction and information deemed necessary by the Board: Provided, That section 6101 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any purchase or procurement of supplies or services by the Board from moneys in the fund when the aggregate amount involved does not exceed $300. Determinations of the Board whether the fund or an appropriation for the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] is properly chargeable with the authorized expenses, or parts thereof, incurred in the administration of such Act, or of this chapter, shall be binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons, including the Comptroller General and any other administrative or accounting officer, employee, or agent of the United States and shall not be subject to review in any manner.
<br>(d) Transfer of excess to insurance account
<br>
<br>So much of the balance in the fund as of September 30 of each year as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall as of such date be transferred from the fund and credited to the account.

<br>
<br>For the purpose of any investigation or other proceeding relative to the determination of any right to benefits, or relative to any other matter within its jurisdiction under this chapter, the Board shall have the power to issue subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence, documentary or otherwise, that relates to any matter under investigation or in question, before the Board or any member, employee, or representative thereof. Any member of the Board or any of its employees or representatives designated by it may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. Such attendance of witnesses and production of evidence may be required from any place in the United States or any Territory or possession thereof at any designated place of hearing. All subpenas may be served and returned by anyone authorized by the Board in the same manner as is now provided by law for the service and return by United States marshals of subpenas in suits in equity. Such service may also be made by registered mail or by certified mail and in such case the return post-office receipt shall be proof of service. Witnesses summoned in accordance with this subsection shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States.
<br>(b) Enforcement of subpenas by courts; contempts; service of orders, writs, or processes
<br>
<br>In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena lawfully issued to, any person, the Board may invoke the aid of the district court of the United States or the United States courts of any Territory or possession, where such person is found or resides or is otherwise subject to service of process, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia if the investigation or proceeding is being carried on in the District of Columbia, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, if the investigation or proceeding is being carried on in the Northern District of Illinois, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Any such court shall issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board or its specified employee or representative at the place specified in the subpena of the Board, whether within or without the judicial district of the court, there to produce evidence, if so ordered, or there to give testimony concerning the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof. All orders, writs, and processes in any such proceeding may be served in the judicial district of the district court issuing such order, writ, or process, except that the orders, writs, and processes of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in such proceedings may run and be served anywhere in the United States.
<br>(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 91–452, title II, §239, Oct. 15, 1970, 84 Stat. 930
<br>(d) Information as confidential
<br>
<br>Information obtained by the Board in connection with the administration of this chapter shall not be revealed or open to inspection nor be published in any manner revealing an employee's identity: Provided, however, That (i) the Board may arrange for the exchange of any information with governmental agencies engaged in functions related to the administration of this chapter; (ii) the Board may disclose such information in cases in which the Board finds that such disclosure is clearly in furtherance of the interest of the employee or his estate; (iii) any claimant of benefits under this chapter shall, upon his request, be supplied with information from the Board's records pertaining to his claim; and (iv) the Board shall disclose to any base-year employer of a claimant for benefits any information, including information as to the claimant's identity, that is necessary or appropriate to notify such employer of the claim for benefits or to full and fair participation by such employer in an appeal, hearing, or other proceeding relative to the claim pursuant to section 355 of this title. Subject to the provisions of this section, the Board may furnish such information to any person or organization upon payment by such person or organization to the Board of the cost incurred by the Board by reason thereof; and the amounts so paid to the Board shall be credited to the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund established pursuant to section 361(a) of this title;
<br>(e) Certification of claims; authorization of employee to make payments; bond
<br>
<br>The Board shall provide for the certification of claims for benefits and refunds and may arrange total or partial settlements at such times and in such manner as may appear to the Board to be expedient. The Board shall designate and authorize one or more of its employees to sign vouchers for the payment of benefits and refunds under this chapter. Each such employee shall give bond, in form and amount fixed by the Board, conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duties. The premiums due on such bonds shall be paid from the fund and deemed to be a part of the expenses of administering this chapter.
<br>(f) Cooperation with other agencies administering unemployment or sickness compensation laws; agreements
<br>
<br>The Board may cooperate with or enter into agreement with the appropriate agencies charged with the administration of State, Territorial, Federal, or foreign unemployment-compensation or sickness laws or employment offices, with respect to investigations, the exchange of information and services, the establishment, maintenance, and use of free employment service facilities, and such other matters as the Board deems expedient in connection with the administration of this chapter, and may compensate any such agency for services or facilities supplied to the Board in connection with the administration of this chapter. The Board may enter also into agreements with any such agency, pursuant to which any unemployment or sickness benefits provided for by this chapter or any other unemployment-compensation or sickness law, may be paid through a single agency to persons who have, during the period on the basis of which eligibility for and duration of benefits is determined under the law administered by such agency or under this chapter, or both, performed services covered by one or more of such laws, or performed services which constitute employment as defined in this chapter: Provided, That the Board finds that any such agreement is fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.
<br>(g) Benefits also subject to a State law; mutual reimbursement
<br>
<br>In determining whether an employee has qualified for benefits in accordance with section 353 of this title, and in determining the amount of benefits to be paid to such employee in accordance with section 352(a) and (c) of this title, the Board is authorized to consider as employment (and compensation therefor) services for hire other than employment (and remuneration therefor) if such services for hire are subject to an unemployment or sickness compensation law of any State, provided that such State has agreed to reimburse the United States such portion of the benefits to be paid upon such basis to such employee as the Board deems equitable. Any amounts collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited to the account.
<br>
<br>If a State, in determining whether an employee is eligible for unemployment or sickness benefits under an unemployment or sickness compensation law of such State, and in determining the amount of unemployment or sickness benefits to be paid to such employee pursuant to such unemployment or sickness compensation law, considers as services for hire (and remuneration therefor) included within the provisions of such unemployment or sickness compensation law, employment (and compensation therefor), the Board is authorized to reimburse such State such portion of such unemployment or sickness benefits as the Board deems equitable; such reimbursements shall be paid from the account, and are included within the meaning of the word "benefits" as used in this chapter.

Such employers and organizations, and persons employed by either of them, shall not be subject to section 209 of title 18.
<br>(i) Free employment offices; registration of unemployed; statements of sickness; reemployment
<br>
<br>The Board may establish, maintain, and operate free employment offices, and may designate as free employment offices facilities maintained by (i) a railway labor organization which is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in accordance with the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], or (ii) any other labor organization which has been or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, or (iii) one or more employers, or (iv) an organization of employers, or (v) a group of such employers and labor organizations, or (vi) a State, Territorial, foreign, or the Federal Government.

<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe a procedure for registration of unemployed employees at employment offices. Such procedure for registration shall be prescribed with a view to such registration affording substantial evidence of the days of unemployment of the employees who register. The Board may, when such registration is made personally by an employee, accept such registration as initial proof of unemployment sufficient to certify for payment a claim for benefits.
<br>
<br>The Board shall provide a form or forms for statements of sickness and a procedure for the execution and filing thereof. Such forms and procedure shall be designated with a view to having such statements provide substantial evidence of the days of sickness of the employee. Such statements may be executed by any doctor (authorized to practice in the State or foreign jurisdiction in which he practices his profession) or any officer or supervisory employee of a hospital, clinic, group health association, or other similar organization, who is qualified under such regulations as the Board may prescribe to execute such statements. The Board shall issue regulations for the qualification of such persons to execute such statements. When so executed by any such person, or, in the discretion of the Board, by others designated by the Board individually or by groups, they may be accepted as initial proof of days of sickness sufficient to certify for payment a claim for benefits.
<br>
<br>The regulations of the Board concerning registration at employment offices by unemployed persons may provide for group registration and reporting, through employers, and need not be uniform with respect to different classes of employees.
<br>
<br>The operation of any employment facility operated by the Board shall be directed primarily toward the reemployment of employees who have theretofore been substantially employed by employers.
<br>(j) Advisory councils; members' remuneration
<br>
<br>The Board may appoint national or local advisory councils composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers, representatives of employees, and persons representing the general public, for the purpose of discussing problems in connection with the administration of this chapter and aiding the Board in formulating policies. The members of such councils shall serve without remuneration, but shall be reimbursed for any necessary traveling and subsistence expenses or on a per diem basis in lieu of subsistence expenses.
<br>(k) Reduction of unemployment; training and reemployment of unemployed employees, etc.
<br>
<br>The Board, with the advice and aid of any advisory council appointed by it, shall take appropriate steps to reduce and prevent unemployment and loss of earnings; to encourage and assist in the adoption of practical methods of vocational training, retraining, and vocational guidance; to promote the reemployment of unemployed employees; and to these ends to carry on and publish the results of investigations and research studies.

A person in the employ of the Board under section 205 of the Act of Congress approved June 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 307), shall acquire a competitive classified civil-service status if, after recommendation by the Board to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, he shall pass such noncompetitive tests of fitness as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe. A person in the employ of the Board on June 30, 1939, and on June 30, 1940, and who has had experience in railroad service, shall acquire a competitive classified civil-service status if, after recommendation by the Board to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, he shall pass such noncompetitive tests of fitness for the position for which the Board recommends him as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe.
<br>
<br>The Board may employ such persons and provide for their remuneration and expenses, as may be necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. Such persons shall be employed and their remuneration prescribed in accordance with the civil-service laws and chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5: Provided, That all positions to which such persons are appointed, except one administrative assistant to each member of the Board, shall be in and under the competitive civil service and shall not be removed or excepted therefrom: Provided, That in the employment of such persons the Board shall give preference, as between applicants attaining the same grades, to persons who have had experience in railroad service, and notwithstanding any other provisions of law, rules, or regulations, no other preference shall be given or recognized: And provided further, That certification by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of persons for appointment to any positions at minimum salaries of $4,600 per annum, or less, shall, if the Board so requests, be upon the basis of competitive examinations, written, oral, or both, as the Board may request: And provided further, That, for the purpose of registering unemployed employees who reside in areas in which no employer facilities are located, or in which no employer will make facilities available for the registration of such employees, the Board may, without regard to civil-service laws and chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, appoint persons to accept, in such areas, registration of such employees and perform services incidental thereto and may compensate such persons on a piece-rate basis to be determined by the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board may detail employees from stations outside the District of Columbia to other stations outside the District of Columbia or to service in the District of Columbia, and may detail employees in the District of Columbia to service outside the District of Columbia: Provided, That all details hereunder shall be made by specific order and in no case for a period of time exceeding one hundred and twenty days. Details so made may, on expiration, be renewed from time to time by order of the Board, in each particular case, for periods not exceeding one hundred and twenty days.
<br>(m) Delegation of powers
<br>
<br>The Board is authorized to delegate to any member, officer, or employee of the Board any of the powers conferred upon the Board by this chapter, excluding only the power to prescribe rules and regulations.
<br>(n) Sickness benefits; examinations; information and reports; contracts and expenses for examinations
<br>
<br>Any employee claiming, entitled to, or receiving sickness benefits under this chapter may be required to take such examination, physical, medical, mental, or otherwise, in such manner and at such times and by such qualified individuals, including medical officers or employees of the United States or a State, as the Board may prescribe. The place or places of examination shall be reasonably convenient for the employee. No sickness benefits shall be payable under this chapter with respect to any period during which the employee unreasonably refuses to take or willfully obstructs an examination as prescribed by the Board.
<br>
<br>Any doctor who renders any attendance, treatment, attention, or care, or performs any examination with respect to a sickness of an employee, upon which a claim or right to benefits under this chapter is based, shall furnish the Board, in such manner and form and at such times as the Board by regulations may prescribe, information and reports relative thereto and to the condition of the employee. An application for sickness benefits under this chapter shall contain a waiver of any doctor-patient privilege that the employee may have with respect to any sickness period upon which such application is based: Provided, That such information shall not be disclosed by the Board except in a proceeding relating to any claim for benefits by the employee under this chapter.
<br>
<br>The Board may enter into agreements or arrangements with doctors, hospitals, clinics, or other persons for securing the examination, physical, medical, mental, or otherwise, of employees claiming, entitled to, or receiving sickness benefits under this chapter and the performance of services or the use of facilities in connection with the execution of statements of sickness. The Board may compensate any such doctors, hospitals, clinics, or other persons upon such reasonable basis as the Board shall prescribe. Such doctors, hospitals, clinics, or other persons and persons employed by any of them shall not be subject to section 209 of title 18. In the event that the Board pays for the physical or mental examination of an employee or for the execution of a statement of sickness and such employee's claim for benefits is based upon such examination or statement, the Board shall deduct from any sickness benefits payable to the employee pursuant to such claim such amount as, in the judgment of the Board, is a fair and reasonable charge for such examination or execution of such statement.
<br>(o) Liability of third party for sickness; reimbursement of Board
<br>
<br>Benefits payable to an employee with respect to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through suit, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under a health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled by way of reimbursement.
<br>(p) Disqualification to execute statements of sickness or receive fees
<br>
<br>The Board may, after hearing, disqualify any person from executing statements of sickness who, the Board finds, (i) will have solicited, or will have employed another to solicit, for himself or for another the execution of any such statement, or (ii) will have made false or misleading statements to the Board, to any employer, or to any employee, in connection with the awarding of any benefits under this chapter, or (iii) will have failed to submit medical reports and records required by the Board under this chapter, or will have failed to submit any other reports, records, or information required by the Board in connection with the administration of this chapter or any other Act heretofore or hereafter administered by the Board, or (iv) will have engaged in any malpractice or other professional misconduct. No fees or charges of any kind shall accrue to any such person from the Board after his disqualification.
<br>(q) Investigations and research with respect to accidents and disabilities
<br>
<br>The Board shall engage in and conduct research projects, investigations, and studies with respect to the cause, care, and prevention of, and benefits for, accidents and disabilities and other subjects deemed by the Board to be related thereto, and shall recommend legislation deemed advisable in the light of such research projects, investigations, and studies.
