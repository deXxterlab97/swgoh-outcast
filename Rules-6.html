<br> 
<br>border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
<br>11And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three regions. 12Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites were resolved to dwell in that land. 13And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, but did not utterly drive them out.
<br>14And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying: ‘Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me thus?’ 15And Joshua said unto them: ‘If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.’ 16And the children of Joseph said: ‘The hill-country will not be enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.’ 17And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
<br> 
<br>to Manasseh, saying: ‘Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only; 18but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they be strong.’
<br>And the whole congregation of the	children	of	Israel assembled	themselves		together	at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. 2And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. 3And Joshua said unto the children of Israel: ‘How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, hath given you? 4Appoint for you three men for each tribe; and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me. 5And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north. 6And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring the description hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 7For the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance; and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond
<br> 
<br>the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.’
<br>8And the men arose, and went; and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying: ‘Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.’ 9And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book, and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh. 10And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD; and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
<br>11And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 12And their border on the north side was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 13And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz—the same is Beth-el—southward; and the border went down to Atroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether. 14And the border was drawn and turned about on the west side southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof
<br> 
<br>were at Kiriath-baal—the same is Kiriath-jearim—a city of the children of Judah; this was the west side. 15And the south side was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah. 16And the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the Valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. 17And it was drawn on the north, and went out at En- shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 18And it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah. 19And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan; this was the south border. 20And the Jordan was to be the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
<br>21Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth- hoglah, and Emek-keziz; 22and Beth- arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el;
<br> 
<br>23and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah; 24and Chephar-ammonah, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages: 25Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth; 26and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah; 27and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah; 28and Zela, Eleph, and the Jebusite—the same is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
<br>
<br>And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe
<br>of the children of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah. 2And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba with Sheba, and Moladah; 3and Hazarshual, and Balah, and Ezem; 4and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah; 5and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah; 6and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages: 7Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages; 8and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, as far as Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. 9Out of the allotment of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them; therefore the children of Simeon had
<br> 
<br>inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
<br>10And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid. 11And their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam. 12And it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Dobrath, and went up to Japhia. 13And from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon- methoar unto Neah. 14And the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtahel; 15and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Beth-lehem; twelve cities with their villages. 16This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<br>17The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families. 18And their border was Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem; 19and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath; 20and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez; 21and Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez; 22and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazim, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their
<br> 
<br>villages. 23This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
<br>24And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families. 25And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph; 26and Allam- melech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath. 27And it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun and to the valley of Iphtahel northward at Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand, 28and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon. 29And the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea from Hebel to Achzib; 30Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob; twenty and two cities with their villages. 31This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<br>32The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 33And their border was from Heleph, from Elon-beza-anannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan. 34And the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukok; and it
<br> 
<br>reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising. 35And the fortified cities were Ziddim-zer, and Hammath, and Rakkath, and Chinnereth; 36and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor; 37and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor; 38and Iron, and Migdal-el, and Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 39This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
<br>40The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families. 41And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh; 42and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah; 43and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron; 44and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath; 45and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon; 46and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa. 47And the border of the children of Dan was too strait for them; so the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 48This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<br> 
<br>49When they had made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them; 50according to the commandment of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
<br>51These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Joshua, saying: 2’Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spoke unto you by the hand of Moses; 3that the manslayer that killeth any person through error and unawares may flee thither; and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. 4And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 5And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand;  because he smote his neighbour unawares, and
<br> 
<br>hated him not beforetime. 6And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days; then may the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.’
<br>7And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba—the same is Hebron—in the hill-country of Judah. 8And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the table-land out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 9These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person through error might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
<br>Then came near the heads of fathers’houses of the Levites
<br>unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers’houses of the tribes of the children of Israel; 2and they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying: ‘The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the open land thereabout for our cattle.’ 3And the children of Israel gave unto the
<br> 
<br>Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of the LORD, these cities with the open land about them.
<br>4And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites; and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
<br>5And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
<br>6And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
<br>7The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
<br>8And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with the open land about them, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
<br>9And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name. 10And they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
<br> 
<br>11And they gave them Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of aAnak— the same is Hebron—in the hill- country of Judah, with the open land round about it. 12But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
<br>13And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with the open land about it; 14and Jattir with the open land about it, and Eshtemoa with the open land about it; 15and Holon with the open land about it, and Debir with the open land about it; 16and Ain with the open land about it, and Juttah with the open land about it, and Beth- shemesh with the open land about it; nine cities out of those two tribes. 17And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with the open land about it, Geba with the open land about it; 18Anathoth with the open land about it, and Almon with the open land about it; four cities. 19All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with the open land about them.
<br>20And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 21And they gave them Shechem with the open land about it in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of
<br>
<br>a Heb. Anok.
<br> 
<br>refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with the open land about it; 22and Kibzaim with the open land about it, and Beth-horon with the open land about it; four cities. 23And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with the open land about it, Gibbethon with the open land about it; 24Aijalon with the open land about it, Gath-rimmon with the open land about it; four cities. 25And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with the open land about it, and Gath- rimmon with the open land about it; two cities. 26All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with the open land about them.
<br>27And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer; and Beeshterah with the open land about it; two cities. 28And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with the open land about it, Dobrath with the open land about it; 29Jarmuth with the open land about it, En-gannim with the open land about it; four cities. 30And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with the open land about it, Abdon with the open land about it; 31Helkath with the open land about it, and Rehob with the open land about it; four cities. 32And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with the open land about it, and Kartan with the
<br> 
<br>open land about it; three cities. 33All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with the open land about them.
<br>34And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with the open land about it, and Kartah with the open land about it; 35Dimnah with the open land about it, Nahalal with the open land about it; four cities. [a36And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with the open land about it, and Jahaz with the open land about it; 37Kedemoth with the open land about it, and Mephaath with the open land about it; four cities.] 38And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with the open land about it, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with the open land about it; 39Heshbon with the open land about it, Jazer with the open land about it; four cities in all. 40All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
<br>41All the cities of the Levites—forty and eight cities with the open land about them—shall be in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, 42even these cities, every one with the
<br>
<br>
<br>a These two verses, taken from I Chron. Vi 63-64, are excluded from the text in authorative codicies and placed in the margin.
<br> 
<br>open land round about it; thus it shall be with all these cities.
<br>43So the LORD   gave unto Israel all the land which He swore to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. 44And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that He swore unto their fathers; and there stood not a man of all their enemies against them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand. 45There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
<br>Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
<br>and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 2and said unto them: ‘Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you; 3ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. 4And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as He spoke unto them; therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan. 5Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and to cleave unto
<br> 
<br>Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.’ 6So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents.
<br>7Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them, 8and spoke unto them, saying: ‘Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.’
<br>9And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 10And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon. 11And the children of Israel heard say: ‘Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan,
<br> 
<br>on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.’ 12And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
<br>13And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest; 14and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’houses among the thousands of Israel. 15And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying: 16’Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD: What treachery is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against the LORD? 17Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD, 18that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow He will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 19Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye
<br> 
<br>over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD’S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us; but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God. 20Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass concerning the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.’
<br>21Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke unto the heads of the thousands of Israel: 22’God, God, the LORD, God, God, the LORD, He knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in treachery against the LORD—save Thou us not this day— 23that we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if to offer thereon burnt- offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let the LORD Himself require it; 24and if we have not rather out of anxiety about a matter done this, saying: In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying: What have ye to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? 25for the LORD hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in the LORD; so might your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. 26Therefore we said: Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for
<br> 
<br>burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; 27but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt- offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come: Ye have no portion in the LORD. 28Therefore said we: It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say: Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. 29Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn away this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt- offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before His tabernacle.’
<br>30And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well. 31And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh: ‘This day we know that the LORD is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this treachery against the LORD; now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the
<br> 
<br>LORD.’ 32And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them back word. 33And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt. 34And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar—: ‘for it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.’
<br>And it came to pass after many days, when the LORD had given
<br>rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years; 2that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them: ‘I am old and well stricken in years. 3And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God, He it is that hath fought for you. 4Behold, I have allotted unto you for an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun. 5And the LORD your God, He shall thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your
<br> 
<br>sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God spoke unto you. 6Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 7that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor worship them; 8but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day; 9wherefore the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and mighty; but as for you, no man hath stood against you unto this day. 10One man of you hath chased a thousand; for the LORD your God, He it is that fought for you, as He spoke unto you. 11Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. 12Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you; 13know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and pricks in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. 14And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; consider ye therefore in all your heart and in all your soul, that not one thing hath
<br> 
<br>failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof. 15And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which the LORD your God spoke unto you, so shall the LORD bring upon you all the evil things, until He have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. 16When ye transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which He hath given unto you.’
<br>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
<br>and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 2And Joshua said unto all the people: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods. 3And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 4And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 5And I
<br> 
<br>sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof; and afterward I brought you out. 6And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea. 7And when they cried out unto the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days. 8And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan; and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 9Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 10But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he even blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand. 11And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. 12And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 13And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not laboured, and
<br> 
<br>cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat. 14Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve Him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. 15And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.’
<br>16And the people answered and said: ‘Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 17for the LORD our God, He it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed; 18and the LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land; therefore we also will serve the LORD; for He is our God.’
<br>19And Joshua said unto the people: ‘Ye cannot serve the LORD; for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression nor your sins. 20If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then He will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that He hath done you good.’
<br> 
<br>21And the people said unto Joshua: ‘Nay; but we will serve the LORD.’ 22And Joshua said unto the people: ‘Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve Him.—And they said: ‘We are witnesses.’— 23Now therefore put away the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD, the God of Israel.’ 24And the people said unto Joshua: ‘The LORD our God will we serve, and unto His voice will we hearken.’
<br>25So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 26And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. 27And Joshua said unto all the people: ‘Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke unto us; it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.’ 28So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.
<br>29And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old. 30And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 31And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known
<br> 
<br>all the work of the LORD, that He had wrought for Israel. 32And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a
<br> 
<br>hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. 33And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the Hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
<br>

<br>JUDGES
<br> 
<br>AND IT came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children
<br>of Israel asked the LORD, saying: ‘Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?’ 2And LORD said: ‘Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.’ 3And Judah said unto Simeon his brother: ‘Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot.’ So Simeon went with him. 4And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 5And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 6But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 7And Adoni-bezek said: ‘Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me.’ And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
<br>8And the children of Judah fought Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. 9And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight
<br> 
<br>against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the Lowland. 10And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron—now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba—and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 11And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir—now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. 12And Caleb said: ‘He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.’ 13And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 14And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her: ‘What wouldest thou?’ 15And she said unto him: ‘Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the Southland, give me therefore springs of water.’ And Caleb gave her the Upper Springs and the Nether Springs.
<br>16And the children of the Kenite, Moses’father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. 17And Judah went with Simeon his brother,
<br> 
<br>and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. 18Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof. 19And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. 20And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak. 21And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem, unto this day.
<br>22And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and the LORD was with them. 23And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el—now the name of the city beforetime was Luz. 24And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him: ‘Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.’ 25And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. 26And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.
<br>27And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its
<br> 
<br>towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites were resolved to dwell in that land. 28And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to task-work, but did in no wise drive them out.
<br>29And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
<br>30Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the: inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributary.
<br>31Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; 32but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
<br>33Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them.
<br>34And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley. 35But the Amorites were resolved to dwell in Harheres, in
<br> 
<br>Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary. 36And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.
<br>And the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And
<br>he said: ‘. . . I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said: I will never break My covenant with you; 2and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars; but ye have not hearkened unto My voice; what is this ye have done? 3Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be unto you as snares, and their gods shall be a trap unto you.’ 4And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. 5And they called the name of that place aBochim; and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
<br>6Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 7And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD, that He had wrought for Israel. 8And Joshua the
<br>
<br>a That is, Weepers.
<br> 
<br>son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old. 9And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath- heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 10And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, that knew not the LORD, nor yet the work which He had wrought for Israel. 11And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim. 12And they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were	round	about	them,		and worshipped them; and they provoked the LORD. 13And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. 14And the anger of the LORD was kindled		against		Israel,		and			He delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and He gave them over into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. 15Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken, and as the LORD had sworn unto them; and they were sore distressed. 16And the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled		them.		17And		yet	they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went astray after other gods, and
<br> 
<br>worshipped them; they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not so. 18And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented the LORD because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them. 19But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to worship them; they left nothing undone of their practices, nor of their stubborn way. 20And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel; and He said: ‘Because this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto My voice; 21I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died; 22that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.’ 23So the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered He them into the hand of Joshua.
<br>Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 2only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the
<br> 
<br>least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof; 3namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath. 4And they were there, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 5And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites; 6and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<br>7And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. 8Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram- naharaim; and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. 9And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. 10And the spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into his hand; and his hand prevailed
<br> 
<br>against Cushan-rishathaim. 11And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<br>12And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 13And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees. 14And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 15But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed; and the children of Israel sent a present by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. 16And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 17And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab—now Eglon was a very fat man. 18And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bore the present. 19But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said: ‘I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.’ And he said: ‘Keep silence.’ And all that stood by him went out from him. 20And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said: ‘I have a message from God unto thee.’ And he arose out of his seat.
<br> 
<br>21And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. 22And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and it came out behind. 23Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and locked them. 24Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they, said: ‘Surely he is covering his feet in the cabinet of the cool chamber.’ 25And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; therefore they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. 26And Ehud escaped while they lingered, having passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. 27And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a horn in the hill- country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. 28And he said unto them: ‘Follow after me; for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.’ And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. 29And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not a man.
<br> 
<br>30So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
<br>31And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also saved Israel.
<br>And the children of Israel again did that which was   evil   in   the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. 2And the LORD gave them over into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-goiim. 3And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
<br>children of Israel.
<br>4Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 5And she sat under the palm- tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 6And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him: ‘Hath not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, saying: Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 7And I will draw unto thee to the brook Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand. 8And Barak said unto her: ‘If thou wilt go with me, then I will go;
<br> 
<br>but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.’ 9And she said: ‘I will surely go with thee; notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the LORD will give Sisera over into the hand of a woman.’ And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. 10And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.
<br>11Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
<br>12And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 13And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, unto the brook Kishon. 14And Deborah said unto Barak: ‘Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not the LORD gone out before thee?’ So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 15And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. 16But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth-goiim; and all the host
<br> 
<br>of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
<br>17Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 18And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: ‘Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.’ And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 19And he said unto her: ‘Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.’ And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. 20And he said unto her: ‘Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say: Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.’ 21Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. 22And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: ‘Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.’ And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent- pin was in his temples. 23So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 24And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
<br>saying:
<br>2When men let grow their hair in Israel,
<br>When the people offer themselves willingly,
<br>Bless ye the LORD.
<br>3Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;
<br>I, unto the LORD will I sing;
<br>I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>4LORD, when Thou didst go forth out of
<br>Seir,
<br>When Thou didst march out of the field of Edom,
<br>The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,
<br>Yea, the clouds dropped water.
<br>5The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD,
<br>Even yon Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>6In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
<br>In the days of Jael, the highways ceased,
<br>And the travellers walked through byways.
<br>7The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,
<br>Until that thou didst arise, Deborah, That thou didst arise a mother in
<br>Israel.
<br> 
<br>8They chose new gods; Then was war in the gates;
<br>Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel?
<br>
<br>9My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
<br>That offered themselves willingly among the people.
<br>Bless ye the LORD.
<br>10Ye that ride on white asses, Ye that sit on rich cloths,
<br>And ye that walk by the way, tell of it;
<br>11Louder than the voice of archers, by the watering-troughs!
<br>There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,
<br>Even the righteous acts of His rulers in Israel.
<br>Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.
<br>
<br>12Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song;
<br>Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
<br>13Then made He a remnant to have dominion over the nobles and the people;
<br>The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
<br>14Out of Ephraim came they whose root is in Amalek;
<br>After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;
<br>Out of Machir came down governors,
<br> 
<br>And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.
<br>15And the princes of Issachar were with
<br>Deborah;
<br>As was Issachar, so was Barak;
<br>Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.
<br>Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart. 16Why sattest thou among the sheep-
<br>folds,
<br>To hear the pipings for the flocks? At the divisions of Reuben
<br>There were great searchings of heart.
<br>17Gilead abode beyond the Jordan;
<br>And Dan, why doth he sojourn by the ships?
<br>Asher dwelt at the shore of the sea, And abideth by its bays.
<br>18Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,
<br>And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.
<br>
<br>19The kings came, they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan, In Taanach by the waters of
<br>Megiddo;
<br>They took no gain of money.
<br>20They fought from heaven,
<br>The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
<br>21The brook Kishon swept them away,
<br>That ancient brook, the brook Kishon.
<br> 
<br>O my soul, tread them down with strength.
<br>22Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the prancings, the
<br>prancings of their mighty ones.
<br>23’Curse ye Meroz’, said the angel of the LORD,
<br>‘Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,
<br>Because they came not to the help of the LORD,
<br>To the help of the LORD against the mighty.’
<br>24Blessed above women shall Jael be,
<br>The wife of Heber the Kenite,
<br>Above women in the tent shall she be blessed.
<br>25Water he asked, milk she gave him;
<br>In a lordly bowl she brought him curd.
<br>26Her hand she put to the tent-pin,
<br>And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer;
<br>And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head,
<br>Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
<br>27At her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay; At her feet he sunk, he fell;
<br>Where he sunk, there he fell down dead.
<br>
<br>28Through the window she looked forth, and peered,
<br>The mother of Sisera, through the lattice:
<br> 
<br>‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
<br>Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
<br>29The wisest of her princesses answer her,
<br>Yea, she returneth answer to herself:
<br>30’Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil?
<br>A damsel, two damsels to every man;
<br>To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
<br>A spoil of dyed garments of embroidery,
<br>Two dyed garments of broidery for the neck of every spoiler?’
<br>
<br>31So perish all Thine enemies, O LORD;
<br>But they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
<br>And the land had rest forty years.
<br>And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 2And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds. 3And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites	came	up,	and	the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them; 4and they encamped against them, and destroyed the produce of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor
<br> 
<br>ox, nor ass. 5For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it. 6And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
<br>7And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of Midian, 8that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel; and he said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 9and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. 10And I said unto you: I am the LORD your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not hearkened unto My voice.’
<br>11And the angel of the LORD came, and sat under the terebinth which was in Ophrah, that belonged unto Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. 12And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him: ‘The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.’ 13And Gideon said unto him: ‘Oh, my lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all His wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying: Did not the
<br> 
<br>LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.’ 14And the LORD turned towards him, and said: ‘Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian; have not I sent thee?’ 15And he said unto him: ‘Oh, my lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.’ 16And the LORD said unto him: ‘Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.’ 17And he said unto him: ‘If now I have found favour in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me. 18Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee.’ And he said: ‘I will tarry until thou come back.’ 19And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the terebinth, and presented it. 20And the angel of God said unto him: ‘Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.’ And he did so. 21Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. 22And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon
<br> 
<br>said: ‘Alas, O Lord GOD! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.’ 23And the LORD said unto him: ‘Peace be unto thee; fear not; thou shalt not die.’ 24Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it a‘Adonai-shalom’; unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<br>25And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him: ‘Take thy father’s bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; 26and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.’ 27Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had spoken unto him; and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. 28And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. 29And they said one to another: ‘Who hath done this thing?’ And when they inquired and asked, they said: ‘Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.’ 30Then the men of the city
<br> 
<br>said unto Joash: ‘Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.’ 31And Joash said unto all that stood against him: ‘Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death before morning; if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.’ 32Therefore on that day he was called bJerubbaal, saying: ‘Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.’
<br>33Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. 34But the spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon; and he blew a horn; and Abiezer was gathered together after him. 35And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him; and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. 36And Gideon said unto God: ‘If Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken, 37behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken.’ 38And it was so; for he rose up early on
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a That is, The LORD is peace.	b That is, Let Baal contend.
<br> 
<br>the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 39And Gideon said unto God: ‘Let not Thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray Thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.’ 40And God did so that night; for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
<br>Then Jerubbaal, who  is  Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-
<br>moreh, in the valley.
<br>2And the LORD said unto Gideon: ‘The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying: mine own hand hath saved me. 3Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.’ And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
<br>4And the LORD said unto Gideon: ‘The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto
<br> 
<br>thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.’ 5So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto Gideon: ‘Everyone that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.’ 6And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 7And the LORD said unto Gideon: ‘By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.’ 8So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
<br>9And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him: ‘Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand. 10But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp. 11And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.’ Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. 12Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts
<br> 
<br>for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude. 13And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his follow, and saying: ‘Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.’ 14And his fellow answered and said: ‘This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.’
<br>15And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said: ‘Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.’ 16And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. 17And he said unto them: ‘Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. 18When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For the LORD and for Gideon! ’
<br>19So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the
<br> 
<br>beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. 20And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: ‘The sword for the LORD and for Gideon! ’ 21And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled. 22And they blew the three hundred horns, and the LORD set every man’s sword a against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel- meholah, by Tabbath. 23And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian. 24And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: ‘Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.’ So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. 25And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
<br> 
<br>And the men of Ephraim said unto him: ‘Why hast thou served
<br>us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?’ And they did chide with him sharply. 2And he said unto them: ‘What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 3God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?’ Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
<br>4And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing. 5And he said unto the men of Succoth: ‘Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.’ 6And the princes of Succoth said: ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine army?’ 7And Gideon said: ‘Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.’ 8And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. 9And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: ‘When I
<br> 
<br>come back in peace, I will break down this tower.’
<br>10Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. 11And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure. 12And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. 13And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. 14And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men. 15And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: ‘Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?’ 16And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. 17And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. 18Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: ‘Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?’ And they answered: ‘As thou art, so were they; of one form
<br> 
<br>with the children of a king.’ 19And he said: ‘They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.’ 20And he said unto Jether his first-born: ‘Up, and slay them.’ But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: ‘Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.’ And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’necks.
<br>22Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: ‘Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.’ 23And Gideon said unto them: ‘I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.’ 24And Gideon said unto them: ‘I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.’—For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites. 25And they answered: ‘We will willingly give them.’ And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil. 26And the weight of the golden ear- rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’necks. 27And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah;
<br> 
<br>and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 28So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
<br>29And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 30And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives. 31And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. 32And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<br>33And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. 34And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side; 35neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel.
<br>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto
<br>his mother’s brethren, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying: 2’Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem: Which is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons,
<br> 
<br>rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.’ 3And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said: ‘He is our brother.’ 4And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him. 5And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
<br>6And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all Beth-millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem. 7And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them: ‘Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. 8The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree: Reign thou over us. 9But the olive-tree said unto them: Should I leave my fatness, seeing that by me they honour God and man, and go to hold sway over the trees? 10And the trees said to the fig-tree: Come thou, and reign over us. 11But the fig-tree said unto them: Should I leave my sweetness, and my
<br> 
<br>good fruitage, and go to hold sway over the trees? 12And the trees said unto the vine: Come thou, and reign over us. 13And the vine said unto them: Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to hold sway over the trees? 14Then said all the trees unto the bramble: Come thou, and reign over us. 15And the bramble said unto the trees: If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 16Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands—17for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian; 18and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid- servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother— 19if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 20But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.’ 21And Jotham ran
<br> 
<br>away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
<br>22And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. 23And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech; 24that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren. 25And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them; and it was told Abimelech.
<br>26And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went on to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. 27And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. 28And Gaal the son of Ebed said: ‘Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? 29And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.’ And he said to Abimelech: ‘Increase thine army, and
<br> 
<br>come out.’ 30And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 31And he sent messengers unto Abimelech in Tormah, saying: ‘Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they will incite the city against thee. 32Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field. 33And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt be able.’
<br>34And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. 35And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment. 36And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: ‘Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.’ And Zebul said unto him: ‘Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.’ 37And Gaal spoke again and said: ‘See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of Elon-meonenim.’ 38Then said Zebul unto him: ‘Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst: Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?
<br> 
<br>is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.’ 39And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 40And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate. 41And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<br>42And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and it was told Abimelech. 43And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people were coming forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. 44And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them. 45And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein; and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<br>46And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of El-berith. 47And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 48And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that
<br> 
<br>were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder; and he said unto the people that were with him: ‘What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.’ 49And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<br>50Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 51But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, even all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower. 52And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went close unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 53And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull. 54Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour-bearer, and said unto him: ‘Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me: A woman slew him.’ And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 55And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 56Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren; 57and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did
<br> 
<br>God requite upon their heads; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
<br>And after Abimelech there arose to  save Israel Tola the
<br>son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim. 2And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
<br>3And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years. 4And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called aHavvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 5And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
<br>6And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the LORD, and served Him not. 7And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon. 8And they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel that year; eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 9And the children of Ammon
<br>
<br>a That is, The villages of Jair.
<br> 
<br>passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was sore distressed. 10And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying: ‘We have sinned against Thee, in that we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.’ 11And the LORD said unto the children of Israel: ‘Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 12The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto Me, and I saved you out of their hand. 13Yet ye have forsaken Me, and served other gods; wherefore I will save you no more. 14Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.’ 15And the children of Israel said unto the LORD: ‘We have sinned; do Thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto Thee; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.’ 16And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD; and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<br>17Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah. 18And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another: ‘What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.’
<br> 
<br>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour,
<br>and he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah. 2And Gilead’s wife bore him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.’ 3Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
<br>4And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 5And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob. 6And they said unto Jephthah: ‘Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.’ 7And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: ‘Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?’ 8And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah: ‘Therefore are we returned to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon, and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.’ 9And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: ‘If ye bring me back home to fight with the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, I will be your head.’ 10And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah: ‘The LORD
<br> 
<br>shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.’ 11Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD in Mizpah.
<br>12And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying: ‘What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?’ 13And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah: ‘Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan; now therefore restore those cities peaceably.’ 14And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon; 15and he said unto him: ‘Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon. 16But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; 17then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh. 18Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other
<br> 
<br>side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 19And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him: Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place. 20But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 21And the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 22And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan. 23So now the LORD, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them? 24Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. 25And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 26While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time? 27I therefore have not sinned
<br> 
<br>against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me; the LORD, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.’ 28Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
<br>29Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. 30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said: ‘If Thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, 31then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.’ 32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hand. 33And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abel-cheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
<br>34And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said: ‘Alas, my
<br> 
<br>daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art become my troubler; for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.’ 36And she said unto him: ‘My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.’ 37And she said unto her father: ‘Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.’ 38And he said: ‘Go.’ And he sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed; and she had not known man. And it was a custom in Israel, 40that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
<br>And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed
<br>to Zaphon; and they said unto Jephthah: ‘Wherefore didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.’ 2And Jephthah said unto them: ‘I and my people were at great strife with the children of
<br> 
<br>Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand. 3And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?’ 4Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said: ‘Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.’ 5And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said: ‘Let me go over, ‘the men of Gilead said unto him: ‘Art thou an Ephraimite?’ If he said: ‘Nay’; 6then said they unto him: ‘Say now Shibboleth’; and he said ‘Sibboleth’; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
<br>7And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
<br>8And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel. 9And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 10and Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
<br> 
<br>11And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 12And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
<br>13And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14And he had forty sons and thirty sons’sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts; and he judged Israel eight years. 15And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.
<br>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil
<br>in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<br>2And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not. 3And the angel of the LORD   appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: ‘Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. 4Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. 5For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.’ 6Then the woman came and told her husband, saying: ‘A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the
<br> 
<br>countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name; 7but he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.’
<br>8Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said: ‘Oh, LORD, I pray Thee, let the man of God whom Thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.’ 9And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. 10And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him: ‘Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me that day.’ 11And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him: ‘Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman?’ And he said: ‘I am.’ 12And Manoah said: ‘Now when thy word cometh to pass, what shall be the rule for the child, and what shall be done with him?’ 13And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: ‘Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. 14She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grapevine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.’ 15And Manoah said unto the angel of
<br> 
<br>the LORD: ‘I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.’ 16And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: ‘Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.’ For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD. 17And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD: ‘What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?’ 18And the angel of the LORD said unto him: ‘Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?’ 19So Manoah took the kid with the meal- offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD; and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. 20For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. 21But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD. 22And Manoah said unto his wife: ‘We shall surely die, because we have seen God.’ 23But his wife said unto him: ‘If the LORD were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal- offering at our hand, neither would He have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.’
<br> 
<br>24And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 25And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
<br>And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah		of		the		daughters		of		the Philistines. 2And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said: ‘I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore get her for me to wife.’ 3Then his father and his mother said unto him: ‘Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest	to	take		a	wife	of		the uncircumcised	Philistines?’			And Samson said unto his father: ‘Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.’ 4But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule
<br>over Israel.
<br>5Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 6And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as one would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 7And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 8And after a while he returned to
<br> 
<br>take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. 9And he scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion. 10And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 11And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 12And Samson said unto them: ‘Let me now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment; 13but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment.’ And they said unto him: ‘Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.’ 14And he said unto them:
<br>Out of the eater came forth food,
<br>And out of the strong came forth sweetness.
<br>And they could not in three days declare the riddle. 15And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife: ‘Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire; have ye called us hither to impoverish us?’ 16And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said: ‘Thou dost but hate me, and
<br> 
<br>lovest me not; thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and wilt thou not tell it me?’ And he said unto her: ‘Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?’ 17And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 18And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down:
<br>What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them:
<br>If ye had not plowed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.
<br>19And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house. 20But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had had for his friend.
<br>But it came to pass after a while, in the   time   of   wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said: ‘I will go in to my wife into the chamber.’ But her father would not suffer him to go in. 2And her father said: ‘I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion; is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of
<br> 
<br>her.’ 3And Samson said unto them: ‘This time shall I be quits with the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.’ 4And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails. 5And when he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards. 6Then the Philistines said: ‘Who hath done this?’ And they said: ‘Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion.’ And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 7And Samson said unto them: ‘If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.’ 8And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
<br>9Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi. 10And the men of Judah said: ‘Why are ye come up against us?’ And they said: ‘To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.’ 11Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson: ‘Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?’ And he said unto them: ‘As they did unto me, so have I done
<br> 
<br>unto them.’ 12And they said unto him: ‘We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.’ And Samson said unto them: ‘Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.’ 13And they spoke unto him, saying: ‘No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.’ And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. 14When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands. 15And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith. 16And Samson said:
<br>With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
<br>With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.
<br>17And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called aRamath-lehi. 18And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said: ‘Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of Thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?’ 19But God cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi, and
<br>
<br>a That is, The hill of the jawbone.
<br> 
<br>there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came back, and he revived; wherefore the name thereof was called aEn-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. 20And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
<br>And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and
<br>went in unto her. 2[And it was told] the Gazites, saying: ‘Samson is come hither.’ And they compassed him in, and lay in wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying: ‘Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.’ 3And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
<br>4And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 5And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her: ‘Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.’ 6And Delilah said to Samson: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith
<br>
<br>a That is, The spring of him that called.
<br> 
<br>thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.’ 7And Samson said unto her: ‘If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as any other man.’ 8Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 9Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And he broke the bowstrings as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. 10And Delilah said unto Samson: ‘Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.’ 11And he said unto her: ‘If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work, hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as any other man.’ 12So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And the liers-in- wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread. 13And Delilah said unto Samson: ‘Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.’ And he said unto her: ‘If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.’ 14And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And he awoke out of his sleep, and
<br> 
<br>plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web. 15And she said unto him: ‘How canst thou say: I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.’ 16And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death. 17And he told her all his heart, and said unto her: ‘There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb; if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.’ 18And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: ‘Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart.’ Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand. 19And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and had the seven locks of his head shaven off; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 20And she said: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And he awoke out of his sleep, and said: ‘I will go out as at other times, and shake myself.’ But he knew not that the LORD was departed from him. 21And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house. 22Howbeit the hair of his
<br> 
<br>head began to grow again after he was shaven.
<br>23And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said: ‘Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.’ 24And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: ‘Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.’ 25And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: ‘Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.’ And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them; and they set him between the pillars. 26And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand: ‘Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.’ 27Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 28And Samson called unto the LORD, and said: ‘O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this once, O God, that I may be this once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.’ 29And Samson took fast hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left. 30And Samson said: ‘Let me
<br> 
<br>die with the Philistines.’ And he bent with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life. 31Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
<br>Now there was a man of the hill-country      of      Ephraim,
<br>whose name was Micah. 2And he said unto his mother: ‘The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.’ And his mother said: ‘Blessed be my son of the LORD.’ 3And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: ‘I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.’ 4And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah. 5And the man Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 6In those days there was no king in Israel;
<br> 
<br>every man did that which was right in his own eyes. 7And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah—in the family of Judah—who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 8And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. 9And Micah said unto him: ‘Whence comest thou?’ And he said unto him: ‘I am a Levite of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.’ 10And Micah said unto him: ‘Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.’ So the Levite went in. 11And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 12And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 13Then said Micah: ‘Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.’
<br>In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those
<br>days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day there had nothing been allotted unto them among the tribes of Israel for an inheritance. 2And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to
<br> 
<br>search it; and they said unto them: ‘Go, search the land’; and they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there. 3When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him: ‘Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?’ 4And he said unto them: ‘Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.’ 5And they said unto him: ‘Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we are going shall be prosperous.’ 6And the priest said unto them: ‘Go in peace; before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.’
<br>7Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in any thing, and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no dealings with any man. 8And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren said unto them: ‘What say ye?’ 9And they said: ‘Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good; and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. 10When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is
<br> 
<br>large; for God hath given it into your hand; a place where there is no want; it hath every thing that is in the earth.’
<br>11And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war. 12And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath- jearim, in Judah; wherefore that place was called Mahaneh-dan unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim. 13And they passed thence unto the hill- country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. 14Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren: ‘Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.’ 15And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. 16And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. 17And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war. 18And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image of the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them:
<br> 
<br>‘What do ye?’ 19And they said unto him: ‘Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest; is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?’ 20And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. 21So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. 22When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. 23And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah: ‘What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?’ 24And he said: ‘Ye have taken away my god which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me: What aileth thee?’ 25And the children of Dan said unto him: ‘Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.’ 26And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house. 27And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the
<br> 
<br>sword; and they burnt the city with fire. 28And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein. 29And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel; howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. 30And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of aManasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. 31So they set them up Micah’s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<br>And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king
<br>in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah. 2And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months. 3And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her back, having his servant with him, and
<br>

<br> 
<br>a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 4And his father- in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 5And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel’s father said unto his son-in-law: ‘Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.’ 6So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel’s father said unto the man: ‘Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.’ 7And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. 8And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel’s father said: ‘Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth’; and they did eat, both of them. 9And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, said unto him: ‘Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.’ 10But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus—the same is Jerusalem; and there were with
<br> 
<br>him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. 11When they were by Jebus—the day was far spent—the servant said unto his master: ‘Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.’ 12And his master said unto him: ‘We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.’ 13And he said unto his servant: ‘Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.’ 14So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. 15And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge. 16And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites. 17And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the broad place of the city; and the old man said: ‘Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?’ 18And he said unto him: ‘We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill- country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that taketh
<br> 
<br>me into his house. 19Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.’ 20And the old man said: ‘Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.’ 21So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. 22As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: ‘Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.’ 23And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: ‘Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed. 24Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so wanton a thing.’ 25But the men would not hearken to him; so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 26Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s
<br> 
<br>house where her lord was, till it was light. 27And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. 28And he said unto her.’ Up, and let us be going’; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and got him unto his place. 29And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. 30And it was so, that all that saw it said: ‘Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.’
<br>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
<br>was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD at Mizpah. 2And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.— 3Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.—And the children of Israel said: ‘Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?’ 4And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said: ‘I
<br> 
<br>came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. 5And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead. 6And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and wantonness in Israel 7Behold, ye are all here, children of Israel, give here your advice and council.’ 8And all the people arose as one man, saying: ‘We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house. 9But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot; 10and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to aGibeah of Benjamin, according to all the wantonness that they have wrought in Israel.’ 11So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
<br>12And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying: ‘What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you? 13Now therefore deliver up the men, the base
<br>
<br>a Heb. Geba.
<br> 
<br>fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.’ But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. 14And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of their cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. 15And the children of Benjamin numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred chosen men. 16All this people, even seven hundred chosen men, were left- handed; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
<br>17And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these were men of war. 18And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said: ‘Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?’ And the LORD said: ‘Judah first.’ 19And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 20And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. 21And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men. 22And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the
<br> 
<br>battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. 23And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even; and they asked of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?’ And the LORD said: ‘Go up against him.’
<br>24And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 25And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 26Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt- offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD. 27And the children of Israel asked of the LORD—for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, 28and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days—saying: ‘Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?’ And the LORD said: ‘Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand.’ 29And Israel set liers- in-wait against Gibeah round about.
<br>30And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 31And the children of Benjamin went
<br> 
<br>out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the field, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, about thirty men of Israel. 32And the children of Benjamin said: ‘They are smitten down before us, as at the first.’ But the children of Israel said: ‘Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.’ 33And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar; and the liers-in- wait of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. 34And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them. 35And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men; all these drew the sword.
<br>36So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.— 37And the liers-in-wait hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in- wait drew forth, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. 38Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait, that they should make a great beacon of smoke rise up out of the city.— 39And the men of Israel turned in the
<br> 
<br>battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said: ‘Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.’ 40But when the beacon began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. 41And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil was come upon them. 42Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the city destroyed them in the midst of the men of Israel. 43They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and overtook them at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. 44And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. 45And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men. 46So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. 47But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months. 48And the men of Israel turned back upon the children
<br> 
<br>of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found; moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
<br>Now the men of Israel had sworn   in   Mizpah,   saying:
<br>‘There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.’ 2And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore. 3And they said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?’ 4And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace- offerings. 5And the children of Israel said: ‘Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto the LORD?’ For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah, saying: ‘He shall surely be put to death.’ 6And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said: ‘There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 7How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?’ 8And they said: ‘What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah?’ And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. 9For when the people were numbered,
<br> 
<br>behold,		there		were	none	of		the inhabitants	of			Jabesh-gilead		there. 10And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh- gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 11And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.’ 12And	they		found		among			the inhabitants		of				Jabesh-gilead		four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 13And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them. 14And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; and yet so they sufficed them not. 15And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes
<br>of Israel.
<br>16Then the elders of the congregation said: ‘How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?’ 17And they said: ‘They that are escaped must be as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel. 18Howbeit we may not give them
<br> 
<br>wives of our daughters.’ For the children of Israel had sworn, saying: ‘Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.’ 19And they said: ‘Behold, there is the feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.’ 20And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying: ‘Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 21and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 22And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to strive with us, that we will say unto them: Grant them graciously unto us; because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle; neither did ye give them unto them, that ye should now be guilty.’ 23And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them. 24And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. 25In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
<br> 
<br>שמואל א
<br>FIRST SAMUEL
<br> 
<br>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill- country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 2And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 3And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto the LORD. 4And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions; 5but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb. 6And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. 7And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat. 8And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?’ 9So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they
<br> 
<br>had drunk—now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of the LORD; 10and she was in bitterness of soul—and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. 11And she vowed a vow, and said: ‘O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.’ 12And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth. 13Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken. 14And Eli said unto her: ‘How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.’ 15And Hannah answered and said: ‘No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD. 16Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.’ 17Then Eli answered and said: ‘Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.’ 18And she said: ‘Let thy servant find
<br> 
<br>favour in thy sight.’ So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. 19And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. 20And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel: ‘because I have asked him of the LORD.’
<br>21And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 22But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: ‘Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.’ 23And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish His word.’ So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him. 24And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young. 25And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli. 26And she said: ‘Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath granted me my petition which I asked
<br> 
<br>of Him; 28therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he is lent to the LORD.’ And he worshipped the LORD there.
<br>
<br>And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the LORD,
<br>My horn is exalted in the LORD;
<br>My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
<br>Because I rejoice in Thy salvation. 2There is none holy as the LORD, For there is none beside Thee; Neither is there any rock like our
<br>God.
<br>3Multiply not exceeding proud talk;
<br>Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth;
<br>For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And by Him actions are weighed.
<br>4The bows of the mighty men are broken,
<br>And they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<br>5They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;
<br>And they that were hungry have ceased;
<br>While the barren hath borne seven,
<br>She that had many children hath languished.
<br>
<br>6The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
<br>7The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich;
<br>He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.
<br> 
<br>8He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
<br>
<br>He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill,
<br>To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are the
<br>LORD’S,
<br>And He hath set the world upon them.
<br>
<br>9He will keep the feet of His holy ones,
<br>But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;
<br>For not by strength shall man prevail.
<br>10They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces;
<br>Against them will He thunder in heaven;
<br>The LORD will judge the ends of the earth;
<br>And He will give strength unto His king,
<br>And exalt the horn of His anointed.
<br>
<br>11And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
<br>12Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD. 13And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band; 14and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the
<br> 
<br>flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh. 15Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: ‘Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.’ 16And if the man said unto him: ‘Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth’; then he would say: ‘Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.’ 17And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.
<br>18But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. 19Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 20And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: ‘The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.’ And they would go unto their own home. 21So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
<br>22Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. 23And he said unto them: ‘Why do ye such things? for I
<br> 
<br>hear evil reports concerning you from all this people. 24Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD’S people do spread abroad. 25If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?’ But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. 26And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
<br>27And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house? 28And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? 29Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people? 30Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. 31Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house,
<br> 
<br>that there shall not be an old man in thy house. 32And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. 33Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men. 34And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them. 35And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever. 36And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’
<br>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. 2And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place—now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see— 3and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God	was,	4that	the	LORD	called Samuel; and he said: ‘Here am I.’
<br> 
<br>5And he ran unto Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he said: ‘I called not; lie down again.’ And he went and lay down. 6And the LORD called yet again Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he answered: ‘I called not, my son; lie down again.’ 7Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 8And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the child. 9Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: ‘Go, lie down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak, LORD; for Thy servant heareth.’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 10And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times: ‘Samuel, Samuel.’ Then Samuel said: ‘Speak; for Thy servant heareth.’ 11And the LORD   said to Samuel: ‘Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. 12In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. 13For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he rebuked them not. 14And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with
<br> 
<br>sacrifice nor offering for ever.’ 15And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision. 16Then Eli called Samuel, and said: ‘Samuel, my son.’ And he said: ‘Here am I.’ 17And he said: ‘What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me, God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.’ 18And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said: ‘It is the LORD; let Him do what seemeth Him good.’
<br>19And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 20And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. 21And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
<br>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
<br>Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. 2And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when the battle was spread, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 3And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said: ‘Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the
<br> 
<br>Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that He may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.’ 4So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who sitteth upon the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 5And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang. 6And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said: ‘What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?’ And they knew that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. 7And the Philistines were afraid, for they said: ‘God is come into the camp.’ And they said: ‘Woe unto us! for there was not such a thing yesterday and the day before. 8Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues and in the wilderness. 9Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.’ 10And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 11And the ark of God was
<br> 
<br>taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
<br>12And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. 13And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. 14And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said: ‘What meaneth the noise of this tumult?’ And the man made haste, and came and told Eli. 15Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. 16And the man said unto Eli: ‘I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army.’ And he said: ‘How went the matter, my son?’ 17And he that brought the tidings answered and said: ‘Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.’ 18And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
<br>19And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her
<br> 
<br>husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came suddenly upon her. 20And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her: ‘Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son.’ But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
<br>21And she named the child aIchabod,
<br>saying: ‘The glory is departed from Israel’; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. 22And she said: ‘The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.’
<br>Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it
<br> 
<br>6But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the borders thereof. 7And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said: ‘The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for His hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.’ 8They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said: ‘What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?’ And they answered: ‘Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.’ And they carried the ark of the God of Israel
<br> 
<br>from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. 2And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 3And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. 4And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. 5Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, There is no glory.
<br> 
<br>about thither. 9And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and emerods broke out upon them. 10So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying: ‘They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.’ 11They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said: ‘Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people’; for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 12And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<br> 
<br>And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
<br> 
<br>offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may
<br> 
<br>seven months. 2And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: ‘What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? declare unto us wherewith we shall send it to its place.’ 3And they said: ‘If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return Him a guilt-offering; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.’ 4Then said they: ‘What shall be the guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?’ And they said: ‘Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. 5Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure He will lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. 6Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when He had wrought among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? 7Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them. 8And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a guilt-
<br> 
<br>go. 9And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then He hath done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.’
<br>10And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 11And they put the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. 12And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth- shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. 13And they of Beth- shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. 14And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth- shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone; and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto the LORD. 15And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. 16And when the five lords of the
<br> 
<br>Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
<br>17And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a guilt-offering unto the LORD: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 18and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto Abel by the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite. 19And He smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark of the LORD, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people amourned, because the LORD had smitten the people with a great slaughter. 20And the men of Beth- shemesh said: ‘Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? and to whom shall it go up from us?’ 21And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying: ‘The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.’
<br>And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of
<br>the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
<br>
<br>a From the Hebrew root abel.
<br> 
<br>2And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel yearned after the LORD. 3And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying: ‘If ye do return unto the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto the LORD, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.’ 4Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
<br>5And Samuel said: ‘Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.’ 6And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there: ‘We have sinned against the LORD.’ And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
<br>7And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 8And the children of Israel said to Samuel: ‘Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that He save us out of the hand of the Philistines.’ 9And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto the LORD; and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD
<br> 
<br>answered him. 10And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel. 11And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car. 12Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it aEben-ezer, saying: ‘Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.’ 13So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel; and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 14And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 15And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 16And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places. 17And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar unto the LORD.
<br>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 2Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and
<br>
<br>a That is, The stone of help.
<br> 
<br>the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba. 3And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
<br>4Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah. 5And they said unto him: ‘Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.’ 6But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said: ‘Give us a king to judge us.’ And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 7And the LORD said unto Samuel: ‘Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them. 8According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken Me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 9Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit thou shalt earnestly forewarn them, and shalt declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.’
<br>10And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 11And he said: ‘This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots. 12And he will appoint them unto him
<br> 
<br>for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. 13And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. 14And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 15And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 16And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 17He will take the tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants. 18And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not answer you in that day.’ 19But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said: ‘Nay; but there shall be a king over us; 20that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.’ 21And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them in the ears of the LORD. 22And the LORD said to Samuel: ‘Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.’ And Samuel said unto the men of Israel: ‘Go ye every man unto his city.’
<br>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish,
<br> 
<br>the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour. 2And he had a son, whose name was Saul, young and goodly, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. 3Now the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son: ‘Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.’ 4And he passed through the hill- country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not; then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. 5When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him: ‘Come and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and become anxious concerning us.’ 6And he said unto him: ‘Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.’ 7Then said Saul to his servant: ‘But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God; what have we?’ 8And the servant answered Saul again, and said: ‘Behold, I have in my
<br> 
<br>hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver, that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.’— 9Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: ‘Come and let us go to the seer’; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer.—10Then said Saul to his servant: ‘Well said; come, let us go.’ So they went unto the city where the man of God was. 11As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them: ‘Is the seer here?’ 12And they answered them, and said: ‘He is; behold, he is before thee; make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place. 13As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.’ 14And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
<br>15Now the LORD had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying: 16’To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over My people Israel, and he shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have
<br> 
<br>looked upon My people, because their cry is come unto Me.’ 17And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD spoke unto him: ‘Behold the man of whom I said unto thee: This same shall have authority over My people.’ 18Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.’ 19And Samuel answered Saul, and said: ‘I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day; and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart. 20And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?’ 21And Saul answered and said: ‘Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?’
<br>22And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons. 23And Samuel said unto the cook: ‘Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee: Set it by thee.’ 24And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said: ‘Behold that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it
<br> 
<br>been kept for thee, for I said: I have invited the people.’ So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 25And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the housetop. 26And they arose early; and it came to pass about the break of day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: ‘Up, that I may send thee away.’ And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 27As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: ‘Bid the servant pass on before us—and he passed on—but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.’
<br>Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his
<br>head, and kissed him, and said: ‘Is it not that the LORD hath anointed thee to be prince over His inheritance? 2When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by the tomb of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee: The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious concerning you, saying: What shall I do for my son? 3Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the terebinth of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine. 4And
<br> 
<br>they will salute thee, and give thee two cakes of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hand. 5After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying. 6And the spirit of the LORD will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 7And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as thy hand shall find; for God is with thee. 8And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace- offerings; seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and tell thee what thou shalt do.’
<br>9And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. 10And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them. 11And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another: ‘What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
<br> 
<br>among the prophets?’ 12And one of the same place answered and said: ‘And who is their father?’ Therefore it became a proverb: ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’ 13And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
<br>14And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant: ‘Whither went ye?’ And he said: ‘To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.’ 15And Saul’s uncle said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.’ 16And Saul said unto his uncle: ‘He told us plainly that the asses were found.’ But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.
<br>17And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpah. 18And he said unto the children of Israel: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. 19But ye have this day rejected your God, who Himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto Him: Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.’ 20So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 21And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family  of the
<br> 
<br>Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him, he could not be found. 22Therefore they asked of the LORD further: ‘Is there yet a man come hither?’ And the LORD answered: ‘Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.’ 23And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 24And Samuel said to all the people: ‘See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?’ And all the people shouted, and said: ‘Long live the king.’
<br>25Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. 26And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the men of valour, whose hearts God had touched. 27But certain base fellows said: ‘How shall this man save us?’ And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he was as one that held his peace.
<br>Then Nahash the Ammonite came    up,    and    encamped
<br>against Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash: ‘Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.’ 2And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them: ‘On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.’ 3And the
<br> 
<br>elders of Jabesh said unto him: ‘Give us seven days’respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to deliver us, we will come out to thee.’ 4Then came the messengers to Gibeath-shaul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept. 5And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said: ‘What aileth the people that they weep?’ And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 6And the spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly. 7And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying: ‘Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.’ And the dread of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out as one man. 8And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 9And they said unto the messengers that came: ‘Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead: To- morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance.’ And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 10And the men of Jabesh said: ‘To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.’
<br> 
<br>11And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. 12And the people said unto Samuel: ‘Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.’ 13And Saul said: ‘There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to- day the LORD hath wrought deliverance in Israel.’
<br>14Then said Samuel to the people: ‘Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.’ 15And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
<br>And Samuel said unto all Israel:	‘Behold,	I	have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. 2And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day. 3Here I am; witness against me before the LORD, and before His anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? or whom have I oppressed?
<br> 
<br>or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.’ 4And they said: ‘Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.’ 5And he said unto them: ‘The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand.’ And they said: ‘He is witness.’
<br>6And Samuel said unto the people: ‘It is the LORD that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 7Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD, which He did to you and to your fathers. 8When Jacob was come into Egypt, then your fathers cried unto the LORD, and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and they were made to dwell in this place. 9But they forgot the LORD their God, and He gave them over into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10And they cried unto the LORD, and said: We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve Thee. 11And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your
<br> 
<br>enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety. 12And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me: Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when the LORD your God was your king. 13Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for; and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you. 14If ye will fear the LORD, and serve Him, and hearken unto His voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of the LORD your God—; 15but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, and against your fathers. 16Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. 17Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.’ 18So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 19And all the people said unto Samuel: ‘Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.’ 20And Samuel said unto the people: ‘Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not
<br> 
<br>aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; 21and turn ye not aside; for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain. 22For the LORD will not forsake His people for His great name’s sake; because it hath pleased the LORD to make you a people unto Himself. 23Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. 24Only fear the LORD, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things He hath done for you. 25But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be swept away, both ye and your king.’
<br>Saul was a—years old when he began to reign; and two years
<br>he reigned over Israel. 2And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmas and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeath-benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 3And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the horn throughout all the land, saying: ‘Let the Hebrews hear.’ 4And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also had
<br>
<br>a The number is wanting in the Hebrew.
<br> 
<br>made himself odious with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
<br>5And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude; and they came up, and pitched in Michmas, eastward of Beth- aven. 6When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait—for the people were distressed—then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in holds, and in pits. 7Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
<br>8And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. 9And Saul said: ‘Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.’ And he offered the burnt-offering. 10And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 11And Samuel said: ‘What hast thou done?’ And Saul said: ‘Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together against Michmas; 12therefore
<br> 
<br>said I: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favour of the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.’ 13And Samuel said to Saul: ‘Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which He commanded thee; for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 14But now thy kingdom shall not continue; the LORD hath sought him a man after His own heart, and the LORD hath appointed him to be prince over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.’
<br>15And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeath-benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. 16And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in aGibeath-benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmas. 17And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual; 18and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
<br>19Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for
<br> 
<br>the Philistines said: ‘Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears’; 20but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 21And the price of the filing was ba pim for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks with three teeth, and for the axes; and to set the goads. 22So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 23And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmas.
<br>Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
<br>unto the young man that bore his armour: ‘Come and let us go over to the Philistines’garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father. 2And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men, 3and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. 4And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a Heb. Geba.	b That is, two-thirds of a shekel.
<br> 
<br>crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 5The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmas, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 6And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: ‘Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us; for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.’ 7And his armour-bearer said unto him: ‘Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy heart.’ 8Then said Jonathan: ‘Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them. 9If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 10But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us.’ 11And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines	said:	‘Behold	Hebrews coming forth out of the holes where they hid themselves.’ 12And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said: ‘Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.’ And Jonathan said unto his armour- bearer: ‘Come up after me; for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.’ 13And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they
<br> 
<br>fell before Jonathan; and his armour- bearer slew them after him. 14And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land. 15And there was a trembling in the camp in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked; so it grew into a terror from God. 16And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeath- benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.
<br>17Then said Saul unto the people that were with him: ‘Number now, and see who is gone from us.’ And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there. 18And Saul said unto Ahijah: ‘Bring hither the ark of God.’ For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel. 19And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said unto the priest: ‘Withdraw thy hand.’ 20And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. 21Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp round about; even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and
<br> 
<br>Jonathan. 22Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 23So the LORD saved Israel that day; and the battle passed on as far as Beth-aven.
<br>24And the men of Israel were distressed that day; but Saul adjured the people, saying: ‘Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies.’ So none of the people tasted food. 25And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground. 26And when the people were come unto the forest, behold a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath. 27But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. 28Then answered one of the people, and said: ‘Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.’ 29Then said Jonathan: ‘My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, how mine eyes are brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? had there not been then a much greater slaughter
<br> 
<br>among the Philistines?’ 31And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmas to Aijalon; and the people were very faint. 32And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood. 33Then they told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.’ And he said: ‘Ye have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone unto me this day.’ 34And Saul said: ‘Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them: Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.’ And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. 35And Saul built an altar unto the LORD; the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
<br>36And Saul said: ‘Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.’ And they said: ‘Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.’ Then said the priest: ‘Let us draw near hither unto God.’ 37And Saul asked counsel of God: ‘Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?’ But He answered him not that day. 38And Saul said: ‘Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 39For, as the LORD liveth, who saveth
<br> 
<br>Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.’ But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. 40Then said he unto all Israel: ‘Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.’ And the people said unto Saul: ‘Do what seemeth good unto thee.’ 41Therefore Saul said unto the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Declare the right.’ And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped. 42And Saul said: ‘Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.’ And Jonathan was taken. 43Then Saul said to Jonathan: ‘Tell me what thou hast done.’ And Jonathan told him, and said: ‘I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; here am I: I will die.’ 44And Saul said: ‘God do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.’ 45And the people said unto Saul: ‘Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it; as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.’ So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 46Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
<br>47So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he
<br> 
<br>turned himself, he put them to the worse. 48And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
<br>49Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal; 50and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was aAbner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 51And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
<br>52And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
<br>And Samuel said unto Saul: ‘The LORD sent me to anoint
<br>thee to be king over His people, over Israel; now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 2Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. 3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.’
<br>
<br>
<br>a Heb. Abiner.
<br> 
<br>4And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 5And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley. 6And Saul said unto the Kenites: ‘Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.’ So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 7And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is in front of Egypt. 8And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 9But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, even the young of the second birth, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was of no account and feeble, that they destroyed utterly.
<br>10Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying: 11’It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My commandments.’ And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. 12And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying: ‘Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he is setting him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.’
<br> 
<br>13And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him: ‘Blessed be thou of the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD.’ 14And Samuel said: ‘What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?’ 15And Saul said: ‘They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.’ 16Then Samuel said unto Saul: ‘Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.’ And he said unto him: ‘Say on.’
<br>17And Samuel said: ‘Though thou be little in thine own sight, art thou not head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed thee king over Israel; 18and the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said: Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. 19Wherefore then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the LORD?’ 20And Saul said unto Samuel: ‘Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 21But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.’ 22And Samuel said:
<br> 
<br>‘Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices,
<br>As in hearkening to the voice of the LORD?
<br>Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
<br>And to hearken than the fat of rams.
<br>23For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,
<br>And stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim.
<br>Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, He hath also rejected thee from being king.’ 24And Saul said unto Samuel: ‘I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice. 25Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.’ 26And Samuel said unto Saul: ‘I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.’ 27And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent. 28And Samuel said unto him: ‘The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. 29And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.’ 30Then he said: ‘I have sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the
<br> 
<br>LORD thy God.’ 31So Samuel returned after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
<br>32Then said Samuel: ‘Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.’ And Agag came unto him in chains. And Agag said: ‘Surely the bitterness of death is at hand.’ 33And Samuel said:
<br>As thy sword hath made women childless,
<br>So shall thy mother be childless among women.
<br>And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
<br>34Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeath- shaul. 35And Samuel never beheld Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul; and the LORD repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.
<br>And the LORD said unto Samuel: ‘How long wilt thou
<br>mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.’ 2And Samuel said: ‘How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.’ And the LORD said: ‘Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. 3And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee.’ 4And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the
<br> 
<br>elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’ 5And he said: ‘Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.’ And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 6And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: ‘Surely the LORD’S anointed is before Him.’ 7But the LORD said unto Samuel: ‘Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.’ 8Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: ‘Neither hath the LORD chosen this.’ 9Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: ‘Neither hath the LORD chosen this.’ 10And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘The LORD hath not chosen these.’ 11And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Are here all thy children?’ And he said: ‘There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.’ And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.’ 12And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. And the LORD said: ‘Arise, anoint him; for this is he.’ 13Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his
<br> 
<br>brethren; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
<br>14Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him. 15And Saul’s servants said unto him: ‘Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifieth thee. 16Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it shall be, when the evil spirit from God cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.’ 17And Saul said unto his servants: ‘Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.’ 18Then answered one of the young men, and said: ‘Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.’ 19Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: ‘Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.’ 20And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. 21And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer. 22And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: ‘Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.’ 23And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David
<br> 
<br>took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
<br>Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
<br>and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 2And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 3And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between them. 4And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 5And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. 6And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. 7And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. 8And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them: ‘Why do ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 9If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will
<br> 
<br>we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.’ 10And the Philistine said: ‘I do taunt the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.’ 11And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
<br>12Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men. 13And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 14And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.—15Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth- lehem.—16And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
<br>17And Jesse said unto David his son: ‘Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren. 18And bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and to thy brethren shalt thou bring greetings, and take their pledge; 19now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, are in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.’ 20And David rose up early in the
<br> 
<br>morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the barricade, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. 21And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. 22And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brethren. 23And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words; and David heard them. 24And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. 25And the men of Israel said: ‘Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to taunt Israel is he come up; and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.’
<br>26And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: ‘What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the taunt from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should have taunted the armies of the living God?’ 27And the people answered him after this manner, saying: ‘So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.’ 28And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled
<br> 
<br>against David, and he said: ‘Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy presumptuousness,	and	the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.’ 29And David said: ‘What have I now done? Was it not but a word?’ 30And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him after the former manner.
<br>31And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he was taken to him. 32And David said to Saul: ‘Let no man’s heart fail within him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.’ 33And Saul said to David: ‘Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.’ 34And David said unto Saul: ‘Thy servant kept his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock, 35I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath taunted the armies of the living God.’ 37And David said: ‘The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver
<br> 
<br>me out of the hand of this Philistine.’ And Saul said unto David: ‘Go, and the LORD shall be with thee.’ 38And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. 39And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he essayed to go [, but could not]; for he had not tried it. And David said unto Saul: ‘I cannot go with these; for I have not tried them.’ And David put them off him. 40And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.
<br>41And the Philistine came nearer and nearer unto David; and the man that bore the shield went before him. 42And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance. 43And the Philistine said unto David: ‘Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?’ And the Philistine cursed David by his god. 44And the Philistine said to David: ‘Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.’ 45Then said David to the Philistine: ‘Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast taunted. 46This day will the LORD deliver thee into my hand; and I
<br> 
<br>will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel; 47and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’S, and He will give you into our hand.’ 48And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 49And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. 50So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. 51And David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their mighty man was dead, they fled. 52And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 53And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
<br> 
<br>Philistines, and they spoiled their camp. 54And David took the head of the philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
<br>55And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host: ‘Abner, whose son is this youth?’ And Abner said: ‘As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.’ 56And the king said: ‘Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.’ 57And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 58And Saul said to him: ‘Whose son art thou, thou young man?’ And David answered: ‘I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.’
<br>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking
<br>unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 2And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house. 3Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. 4And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 5And David went out; whithersoever Saul sent him, he had good success; and Saul set him over the men of war; and it was good
<br> 
<br>in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
<br>6And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments. 7And the women sang one to another in their play, and said:
<br>Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.
<br>8And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said: ‘They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands; and all he lacketh is the kingdom! ’ 9And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 10And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house; and David played with his hand, as he did day by day; and Saul had his spear in his hand. 11And Saul cast the spear; for he said: ‘I will smite David even to the wall.’ And David stepped aside out of his presence twice. 12And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. 13Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 14And David had great success in all his ways; and the LORD was with him. 15And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood
<br> 
<br>in awe of him. 16But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
<br>17And Saul said to David: ‘Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’S battles.’ For Saul said: ‘Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.’ 18And David said unto Saul: ‘Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?’ 19But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 20And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 21And Saul said: ‘I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.’ Wherefore Saul said to David: ‘Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law through the one of the twain.’ 22And Saul commanded his servants: ‘Speak with David secretly, and say: Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee; now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’ 23And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said: ‘Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?’ 24And the servants of Saul told him, saying: ‘On this manner spoke David.’ 25And Saul said: ‘Thus shall ye say to David: The
<br> 
<br>king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ For Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 26And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired; 27and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son- in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 28And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David; and Michal Saul’s daughter loved him. 29And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
<br>30Then the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David prospered more than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
<br>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
<br>that they should slay David; but Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David. 2And Jonathan told David, saying: ‘Saul my father seeketh to slay thee; now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself. 3And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will speak with my
<br> 
<br>father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.’
<br>4And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him: ‘Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his work hath been very good towards thee; 5for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great victory for all Israel; thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?’ 6And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore: ‘As the LORD liveth, he shall not be put to death.’ 7And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.
<br>8And there was war again; and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. 9And an evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand. 10And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the spear into the wall; and David fled, and escaped that night. 11And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal David’s wife told him, saying: ‘If thou save not thy life
<br> 
<br>to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain.’ 12So Michal let David down through the window; and he went, and fled, and escaped. 13And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a quilt of goats’hair at the head thereof, and covered it with a cloth. 14And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said: ‘He is sick.’ 15And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying: ‘Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.’ 16And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the quilt of goats’hair at the head thereof. 17And Saul said unto Michal: ‘Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, that he is escaped?’ And Michal answered Saul: ‘He said unto me: Let me go; why should I kill thee?’
<br>18Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. 19And it was told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.’ 20And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. 21And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 22Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great
<br> 
<br>cistern that is in Secu; and he asked and said: ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ And one said: ‘Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.’ 23And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah; and the spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 24And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say: ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’
<br>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said
<br>before Jonathan: ‘What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?’ 2And he said unto him: ‘Far from it; thou shalt not die; behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.’ 3And David swore moreover, and said: ‘Thy father knoweth well that I have found favour in thine eyes; and he saith: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.’ 4Then said Jonathan unto David: ‘What doth thy soul desire, that I should do it for thee?’ 5And David said unto Jonathan: ‘Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, when I should sit with the king to eat; so let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. 6If thy father miss me at all, then say:
<br> 
<br>David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. 7If he say thus: It is well; thy servant shall have peace; but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him. 8Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?’ 9And Jonathan said: ‘Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? 10Then said David to Jonathan: ‘Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?’ 11And Jonathan said unto David: ‘Come and let us go out into the field.’ And they went out both of them into the field.
<br>12And Jonathan said unto David: ‘The LORD, the God of Israel—when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee? 13The LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the LORD be with thee, as He hath been with my father. 14And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not; 15but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no,
<br> 
<br>not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.’ 16So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David: ‘The LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.’ 17And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
<br>18And Jonathan said unto him: ‘To- morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, thy seat will be empty. 19And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. 20And I will shoot three arrows to the side-ward, as though I shot at a mark. 21And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as the LORD liveth. 22But if I say thus unto the boy: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for the LORD hath sent thee away. 23And as touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, the LORD is between me and thee for ever.’
<br>24So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to the meal to eat. 25And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty. 26Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day; for he
<br> 
<br>thought: ‘Something hath befallen him, he is unclean; surely he is not clean.’ 27And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David’s place was empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son: ‘Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday, nor to-day?’ 28And Jonathan answered Saul: ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem; 29and he said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me; and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.’
<br>30Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him: ‘Thou son of perverse rebellion, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness? 31For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he deserveth to die.’ 32And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him: ‘Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?’ 33And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. 34So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second
<br> 
<br>day of the month; for he was grieved for David, and because his father had put him to shame.
<br>35And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 36And he said unto his lad: ‘Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.’ And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 37And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: ‘Is not the arrow beyond thee?’ 38And Jonathan cried after the lad: ‘Make speed, hasten, stay not.’ And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 39But the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 40And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him: ‘Go, carry them to the city.’ 41And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. 42And Jonathan said to David: ‘Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying: The LORD shall be between me and thee, and
<br>Between my seed and thy seed, for ever.’ 1And he arose
<br>and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.
<br>2Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech
<br> 
<br>came to meet David trembling, and said unto him: ‘Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?’ 3 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest: ‘The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me: Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and the young men have I appointed to such and such a place. 4 Now therefore what is under thy hand? five loaves of bread? give them in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.’ 5And the priest answered David, and said: ‘There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.’ 6 And David answered the priest, and said unto him: ‘Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day, when there shall be holy bread in their vessels?’ 7 So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.— 8 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.— 9 And David said unto Ahimelech: ‘And is there peradventure here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
<br> 
<br>nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.’ 10And the priest said: ‘The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here.’ And David said: ‘There is none like that; give it me.’
<br>11And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 12And the servants of Achish said unto him: ‘Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying:
<br>Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?’
<br>13And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 14And he changed his demeanour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. 15Then said Achish unto his servants: ‘Lo, when ye see a man that is mad, wherefore do ye bring him to me? 16Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?’
<br>
<br>David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the
<br>cave of Adullam; and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to
<br> 
<br>him. 2And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men.
<br>3And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said unto the king of Moab: ‘Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.’ 4And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 5And the prophet Gad said unto David: ‘Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.’ Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
<br>6And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him; now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. 7And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him: ‘Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds; 8that all of you have conspired against me, and there was none that disclosed it to me when my son made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath
<br> 
<br>stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?’ 9Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said: ‘I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 10And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.’
<br>11Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob; and they came all of them to the king. 12And Saul said: ‘Hear now, thou son of Ahitub.’ And he answered: ‘Here I am, my lord.’ 13And Saul said unto him: ‘Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?’ 14Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said: ‘And who among all thy servants is so trusted as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and giveth heed unto thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house? 15Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.’ 16And the king said: ‘Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.’ 17And the king said unto the guard that stood about him: ‘Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is
<br> 
<br>with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me.’ But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. 18And the king said to Doeg: ‘Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.’ And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 19And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 20And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 21And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the LORD’S priests. 22And David said unto Abiathar: ‘I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul; I have brought about the death of all the persons of thy father’s house. 23Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life; for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.’
<br>And they told David, saying: ‘Behold,   the   Philistines    are fighting against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.’ 2Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I go and smite these Philistines?’ And the LORD said unto David: ‘Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.’ 3And David’s men said unto him: ‘Behold, we are afraid here in Judah;
<br> 
<br>how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?’ 4Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said: ‘Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.’ 5And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<br>6And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. 7And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said: ‘God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.’ 8And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 9And David knew that Saul devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest: ‘Bring hither the ephod.’ 10Then said David: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, Thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. 11Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as Thy servant hath heard?’ O LORD, the God of Israel, I beseech Thee, tell Thy servant.’ And the LORD said: ‘He will come down.’ 12Then said David: ‘Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul?’ And the LORD said: ‘They will deliver thee
<br> 
<br>up.’ 13Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbore to go forth.
<br>14And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 15And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life; and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood. 16And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 17And he said unto him: ‘Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.’ 18And they two made a covenant before the LORD; and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
<br>19Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying: ‘Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? 20Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.’ 21And Saul said: ‘Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have had compassion on me. 22Go, I pray you, make yet more
<br> 
<br>sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly. 23See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking- places where he hideth himself, and come ye back to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.’ 24And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of Jeshimon. 25And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. 26And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. 27But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying: ‘Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.’ 28So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore they called
<br>that	place	aSela- hammahlekoth. 1And David
<br>went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.
<br>
<br>a That is, The rock of divisions.
<br> 
<br>2And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying: ‘Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.’ 3Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 4And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. 5And the men of David said unto him: ‘Behold the day in which the LORD hath said unto thee: Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.’ Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily. 6And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt. 7And he said unto his men: ‘The LORD forbid it me, that I should do this thing unto my lord, the LORD’S anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD’S anointed.’ 8So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
<br>9David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying: ‘My lord the king.’ And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself. 10And David said to Saul: ‘Wherefore hearkenest thou to
<br> 
<br>men’s words, saying: Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 11Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said: I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD’S anointed. 12Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou layest wait for my soul to take it. 13The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee. 14As saith the proverb of the ancients: Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee. 15After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 16The LORD therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.’
<br>17And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said: ‘Is this thy voice, my son David?’ And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 18And he said to David: ‘Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil. 19And thou hast declared this day how that thou
<br> 
<br>hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me up into thy hand, thou didst not kill me. 20For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day. 21And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand. 22Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.’ 23And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up unto the stronghold.
<br>And Samuel died; and all Israel	gathered	themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose,	and	went	down	to	the
<br>wilderness of Paran.
<br>2And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 3Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. 4And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 5And David sent ten young men, and David said unto
<br> 
<br>the young men: ‘Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name; 6and thus ye shall say: All hail! and peace be both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. 7And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. 8Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come on a good day; give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.’
<br>9And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. 10And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said: ‘Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a- days that break away every man from his master; 11shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?’ 12So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. 13And David said unto his men: ‘Gird ye on every man his sword.’ And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
<br> 
<br>14But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: ‘Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he flew upon them. 15But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields; 16they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 17Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a base fellow, that one cannot speak to him.’
<br>18Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. 19And she said unto her young men: ‘Go on before me; behold, I come after you.’ But she told not her husband Nabal. 20And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down towards her; and she met them.— 21Now David had said: ‘Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath returned me evil for good. 22God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning
<br> 
<br>light so much as one male.’— 23And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed down to the ground. 24And she fell at his feet, and said: ‘Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid. 25Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: aNabal is his name, and churlishness is with him; but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. 26Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. 27And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord. 28Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD; and evil is not found in thee all thy days. 29And though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he
<br> 
<br>sling out, as from the hollow of a sling. 30And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel; 31that this shall be no stumbling-block unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath found redress for himself. And when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.’
<br>32And David   said   to   bAbigail:
<br>‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me; 33and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for myself with mine own hand. 34For in very deed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one male.’ 35So David received of her hand that which she had brought him; and he said unto her: ‘Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.’
<br>36And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; wherefore she told
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a That is, Churl.	b Heb. Abigal.
<br> 
<br>him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. 37And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 38And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, so that he died.
<br>39And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back His servant from evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath the LORD returned upon his own head.’ And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife. 40And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying: ‘David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.’ 41And she arose, and bowed down with her face to the earth, and said: ‘Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.’ 42And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<br>43David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives. 44Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
<br>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying: ‘Doth
<br> 
<br>not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?’ 2Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 3And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 4David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty. 5And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the barricade, and the people pitched round about him.
<br>6Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying: ‘Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?’ And Abishai said: ‘I will go down with thee.’ 7So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the barricade, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him. 8Then said Abishai to David: ‘God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.’ 9And David said to Abishai: ‘Destroy him not; for who can put forth his
<br> 
<br>hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?’ 10And David said: ‘As the LORD liveth, nay, but the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away. 11The LORD forbid it me, that I should put forth my hand against the LORD’S anointed; but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water and let us go.’ 12So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
<br>13Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them. 14And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: ‘Answerest thou not, Abner?’ Then Abner answered and said: ‘Who art thou that criest to the king?’ 15And David said to Abner: ‘Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. 16This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye deserve to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD’S anointed. And now, see, where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.’
<br> 
<br>17And Saul knew David’s voice, and said: ‘Is this thy voice, my son David?’ And David said: ‘It is my voice, my lord, O king.’ 18And he said: ‘Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand? 19Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be the LORD that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the LORD, saying: Go, serve other gods. 20Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.’
<br>21Then said Saul: ‘I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.’ 22And David answered and said: ‘Behold the king’s spear! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it. 23And the LORD will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as the LORD delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against the LORD’S anointed. 24And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the
<br> 
<br>eyes of the LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.’ 25Then Saul said to David: ‘Blessed be thou, my son David; thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail.’ So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
<br>And David said in his heart: ‘I shall now be swept away one
<br>day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel; so shall I escape out of his hand.’ 2And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 3And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife. 4And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath; and he sought no more again for him.
<br>5And David said unto Achish: ‘If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?’ 6Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day; wherefore Ziklag belongeth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
<br>7And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four
<br> 
<br>months. 8And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. 9And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel. And he returned, and came to Achish. 10And Achish said: ‘Whither have ye made a raid to-day?’ And David said: ‘Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.’ 11And David left neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying: ‘Lest they should tell on us, saying: So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.’ 12And Achish believed David, saying: ‘He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.’
<br>And it came to pass in those days,	that	the		Philistines gathered	their	hosts	together	for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David: ‘Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.’ 2And David said to Achish: ‘Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do.’ And Achish said to David: ‘Therefore will I make thee keeper of
<br>my head for ever.’
<br> 
<br>3Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land. 4And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 5And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 6And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 7Then said Saul unto his servants: ‘Seek me a woman that divineth by a ghost, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.’ And his servants said to him: ‘Behold, there is a woman that divineth by a ghost at En-dor.’
<br>8And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said: ‘Divine unto me, I pray thee, by a ghost, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.’ 9And the woman said unto him: ‘Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that divine by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?’ 10And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying: ‘As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.’ 11Then said the woman: ‘Whom shall I bring up  unto thee?’ And  he
<br> 
<br>said: ‘Bring me up Samuel.’ 12And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying: ‘Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.’ 13And the king said unto her: ‘Be not afraid; for what seest thou?’ And the woman said unto Saul: ‘I see a godlike being coming up out of the earth.’ 14And he said unto her: ‘What form is he of?’ And she said: ‘An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe.’ And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself.
<br>15And Samuel said to Saul: ‘Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?’ And Saul answered: ‘I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.’ 16And Samuel said: ‘Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary? 17And the LORD hath wrought for Himself; as He spoke by me; and the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David. 18Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the LORD, and didst not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. 19Moreover the LORD will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the
<br> 
<br>Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the LORD will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.’
<br>20Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid,	because	of	the	words	of Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 21And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore affrighted, and said unto him: ‘Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me. 22Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.’ 23But he refused, and said: ‘I will not eat.’ But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 24And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she made haste, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof; 25and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to
<br>Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel. 2And the lords of the Philistines passed on
<br> 
<br>by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. 3Then said the princes of the Philistines: ‘What do these Hebrews here?’ And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines: ‘Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?’ 4But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him: ‘Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us; for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men? 5Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying:
<br>Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?’
<br>6Then Achish called David, and said unto him: ‘As the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; nevertheless the lords favour thee not. 7Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.’ 8And David said unto Achish: ‘But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy
<br> 
<br>servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?’ 9And Achish answered and said to David: ‘I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God; notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle. 10Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.’ 11So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<br>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come
<br>to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 2and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great; they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way. 3And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 4Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. 5And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 6And David was
<br> 
<br>greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
<br>7And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech: ‘I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.’ And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 8And David inquired of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them?’ And He answered him: ‘Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.’ 9So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. 10But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
<br>11And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink; 12and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came back to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. 13And David said unto him: ‘To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?’ And he said: ‘I am a young Egyptian, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick. 14We made a raid upon
<br> 
<br>the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.’ 15And David said to him: ‘Wilt thou bring me down to this troop?’ And he said: ‘Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.’
<br>16And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 17And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled. 18And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. 19And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them; David brought back all. 20And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said: ‘This is David’s spoil.’
<br>21And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and  to meet the people
<br> 
<br>that were with him; and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. 22Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said: ‘Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.’ 23Then said David: ‘Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand. 24And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike.’ 25And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
<br>26And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying: ‘Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD’; 27to them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir; 28and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa; 29and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites; 30and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-
<br> 
<br>ashan, and to them that were in Athach; 31and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
<br>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of
<br>Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 2And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 3And the battle went sore against Saul, an the archers overtook him; and he was in great anguish by reason of the archers. 4Then said Saul to his armour-bearer: ‘Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me.’ But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. 5And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him. 6So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together. 7And when the men of Israel
<br> 
<br>that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 8And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 9And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people. 10And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 11And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning	him	that	which	the Philistines had done to Saul, 12all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 13And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted
<br>seven days.
<br> 
<br>שמואל ב
<br>SECOND SAMUEL
<br> 
<br>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 2it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself. 3And David said unto	him:	‘From	whence	comest thou?’ And he said unto him: ‘Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.’ 4And David said unto him: ‘How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.’ And he answered: ‘The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.’ 5And David said unto the young man that told him: ‘How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?’ 6And the young man that told him said: ‘As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him. 7And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I. 8And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite. 9And he said unto me: Stand, I pray
<br> 
<br>thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me. 10So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.’
<br>11Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him. 12And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. 13And David said unto the young man that told him: ‘Whence art thou?’ And he answered: ‘I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.’ 14And David said unto him: ‘How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?’ 15And David called one of the young men, and said: ‘Go near, and fall upon him.’ And he smote him that he died. 16And David said unto him: ‘Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD’S anointed.’
<br>17And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, 18and said—To teach
<br> 
<br>the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:
<br>19Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain!
<br>How are the mighty fallen!
<br>
<br>20Tell it not in Gath,
<br>Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;
<br>Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
<br>Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<br>21Ye mountains of Gilboa,
<br>Let there be no dew nor rain upon you,
<br>Neither fields of choice fruits;
<br>For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
<br>The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
<br>22From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
<br>The bow of Jonathan turned not back,
<br>And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
<br>23Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant
<br>In their lives, even in their death they were not divided;
<br>They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions. 24Ye daughters of Israel, weep over
<br>Saul,
<br>Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,
<br>Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
<br> 
<br>25How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
<br>
<br>Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!
<br>26I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan;
<br>Very pleasant hast thou been unto me;
<br>Wonderful was thy love to me, Passing the love of women.
<br>27How are the mighty fallen,
<br>And the weapons of war perished!
<br>
<br>And it came to pass after this, that David		inquired	of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?’ And the LORD said unto him: ‘Go up.’ And David said: ‘Whither shall I go up?’ And He said: ‘Unto Hebron.’ 2So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 3And his men that were with him did David bring	up,	every	man	with	his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 4And the men of Judah came, and they there anointed David
<br>king over the house of Judah.
<br>And they told David, saying: ‘The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.’ 5And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh- gilead, and said unto them: ‘Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. 6And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto
<br> 
<br>you; and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 7Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.’
<br>8Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 9and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 10Ish-bosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 11And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
<br>12And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out; and they met together by the pool of Gibeon, and sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 14And Abner said to Joab: ‘Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us.’ And Joab said: ‘Let them arise.’ 15Then they arose and passed over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 16And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his
<br> 
<br>fellow’s side; so they fell down together; wherefore that place was called aHelkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 17And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
<br>18And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as one of the roes that are in the field. 19And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 20Then Abner looked behind him, and said: ‘Is it thou, Asahel?’ And he answered: ‘It is I.’ 21And Abner said to him: ‘Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.’ But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. 22And Abner said again to Asahel: ‘Turn thee aside from following me; wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?’ 23Howbeit he refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the groin, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, The field of the sharp knives.
<br> 
<br>24But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 25And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. 26Then Abner called to Joab, and said: ‘Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?’ 27And Joab said: ‘As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then only after the morning the people had gone away, every one from following his brother.’ 28So Joab blew the horn, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 29And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
<br>30And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. 31But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, even of Abner’s men—three hundred and threescore men died. 32And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
<br> 
<br>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed
<br>weaker and weaker.
<br>2And unto David were sons born in Hebron; and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 4and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 5and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
<br>6And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner showed himself strong in the house of Saul. 7Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner: ‘Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?’ 8Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said: ‘Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman. 9God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the LORD hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; 10to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the
<br> 
<br>throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.’ 11And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
<br>12And Abner sent messengers to David straightway, saying: ‘Whose is the land?’ saying also: ‘Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring over all Israel unto thee.’ 13And he said: ‘Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee, that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.’ 14And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying: ‘Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.’ 15And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. 16And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him: ‘Go, return’; and he returned.
<br>17And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying: ‘In times past ye sought for David to be king over you; 18now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying: By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’ 19And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of
<br> 
<br>Benjamin. 20So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 21And Abner said unto David: ‘I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth.’ And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
<br>22And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 23When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying: ‘Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.’ 24Then Joab came to the king, and said: ‘What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 25Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.’ 26And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor-sirah; but David knew it not.
<br>27And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the groin, that he died, for the blood of
<br> 
<br>Asahel his brother. 28And afterward when David heard it, he said: ‘I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner; 29let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.’ 30So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
<br>31And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: ‘Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and wail before Abner.’ And king David followed the bier. 32And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 33And the king lamented for Abner, and said:
<br>Should Abner die as a churl dieth
<br>34Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters;
<br>As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.
<br>And all the people wept again over him. 35And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.’ 36And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; whatsoever the king did, pleased all the people. 37So all the people and all
<br> 
<br>Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 38And the king said unto his servants: ‘Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 39And I am this day weak, and just anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; the LORD reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.’
<br>
<br>And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were affrighted. 2And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,	of	the	children	of Benjamin; for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin; 3and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners
<br>there until this day.
<br>4Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
<br>5And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon. 6And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched
<br> 
<br>wheat; and they smote him in the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 7Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. 8And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king: ‘Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.’ 2009And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them: ‘As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 10when one told me, saying: Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, instead of giving a reward for his tidings. 11How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?’ 12And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
<br>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: ‘Behold, we are thy bone and
<br> 
<br>thy flesh. 2In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.’ 3So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.
<br>4David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 5In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
<br>6And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: ‘Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither’; thinking: ‘David cannot come in hither.’ 7Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 8And David said on that day: ‘Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and [taketh away] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul—.’ Wherefore they say: ‘There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.’ 9And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. 10And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
<br> 
<br>11And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. 12And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel’s sake.
<br>13And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. 14And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon; 15and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia; 16and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
<br>17And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. 18Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 19And David inquired of the LORD, saying: ‘Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?’ And the LORD said unto David: ‘Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.’ 20And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: ‘The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.’ Therefore the name of that
<br> 
<br>place was called aBaal-perazim. 21And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.
<br>22And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 23And when David inquired of the LORD, He said: ‘Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. 24And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.’ 25And David did so, as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
<br>And	David	again		gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 2And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whereupon is called the Name, even the name of the LORD of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim. 3And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill; and Uzzah	and	Ahio,		the	sons	of Abinadab, drove the new cart. 4And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark. 5And David and all the house
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a That is, The possessor of breaches.
<br> 
<br>of Israel played before the LORD with all manner of instruments made of cypress-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals.
<br>6And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled. 7And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. 8And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place was called aPerez-uzzah, unto this day 9And David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said: ‘How shall the ark of the LORD come unto me?’ 10So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 11And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
<br>12And it was told king David, saying: ‘The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God.’ And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy. 13And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a

<br>a That is, The breach of Uzzah.
<br> 
<br>fatling. 14And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. 15So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the horn.
<br>16And it was so, as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 17And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt- offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD. 18And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 19And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake. So all the people departed every one to his house.
<br>20Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said: ‘How did the king of Israel get him honour to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! ’ 21And David said unto Michal: ‘Before the LORD,
