<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Secretary of State of State [sic] declared on March 17, 2016, and on August 15, 2017, that Daesh (also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS) is responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocity crimes against religious and ethnic minority groups in Iraq and Syria, including Christians, Yezidis, and Shia, among other religious and ethnic groups.
<br>
<br>"(2) According to the Department of State's annual reports on international religious freedom—
<br>
<br>"(A) the number of Christians living in Iraq has dropped from an estimated 800,000 to 1,400,000 in 2002 to fewer than 250,000 in 2017; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the number of Yezidis living in Iraq has fluctuated from 500,000 in 2013, to between 350,000 and 400,000 in 2016, and between 600,000 and 750,000 in 2017.
<br>
<br>"(3) The annual reports on international religious freedom further suggest that—
<br>
<br>"(A) Christian communities living in Syria, which had accounted for between 8 and 10 percent of Syria's total population in 2010, are now 'considerably' smaller as a result of the civil war, and
<br>
<br>"(B) there was a population of approximately 80,000 Yezidis before the commencement of the conflict in Syria.
<br>
<br>"(4) Local communities and entities have sought to mitigate the impact of violence directed against religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria, including the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), which has used predominantly private funds to provide assistance to internally displaced Christians, Yezidis, and Muslims throughout the greater Erbil region, while significant needs and diminishing resources have made it increasingly difficult to continue these efforts.

<br>Strategy for the United States Relationship With Saudi Arabia
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–53, title XX, §2043, Aug. 3, 2007, 121 Stat. 524, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Congressional Findings.—Congress finds that:
<br>
<br>"(1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has 'been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism. At the level of high policy, Saudi Arabia's leaders cooperated with American diplomatic initiatives aimed at the Taliban or Pakistan before 9/11. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's society was a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through charities. It was the society that produced 15 of the 19 hijackers.'.
<br>
<br>"(2) Saudi Arabia has an uneven record in the fight against terrorism, especially with respect to terrorist financing, support for radical madrassas, a lack of political outlets for its citizens, and restrictions on religious pluralism, that poses a threat to the security of the United States, the international community, and Saudi Arabia itself.
<br>
<br>"(3) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States concluded that the 'problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship must be confronted, openly'. It recommended that the two countries build a relationship that includes a 'shared commitment to political and economic reform . . . and a shared interest in greater tolerance and cultural respect, translating into a commitment to fight the violent extremists who foment hatred'.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States has a national security interest in working with the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat international terrorists that operate within that country or that operate outside Saudi Arabia with the support of citizens of Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<br>"(5) The United States and Saudi Arabia established a Strategic Dialogue in 2005, which provides a framework for the two countries to discuss a range of bilateral issues at high levels, including counterterrorism policy and political and economic reforms.
<br>
<br>"(6) It is in the national security interest of the United States to support the Government of Saudi Arabia in undertaking a number of political and economic reforms, including increasing anti-terrorism operations conducted by law enforcement agencies, providing more political and religious rights to its citizens, increasing the rights of women, engaging in comprehensive educational reform, enhancing monitoring of charitable organizations, and promulgating and enforcing domestic laws and regulation on terrorist financing.
<br>
<br>"(b) Statement of Policy.—It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to engage with the Government of Saudi Arabia to openly confront the issue of terrorism, as well as other problematic issues such as the lack of political freedoms;
<br>
<br>"(2) to enhance counterterrorism cooperation with the Government of Saudi Arabia; and
<br>
<br>"(3) to support the efforts of the Government of Saudi Arabia to make political, economic, and social reforms, including greater religious freedom, throughout the country.
<br>
<br>"(c) Progress in Counterterrorism and Other Cooperation.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Report.—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 3, 2007], the President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that—
<br>
<br>"(A) describes the long-term strategy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(i) to engage with the Government of Saudi Arabia to facilitate political, economic, and social reforms, including greater religious freedom, that will enhance the ability of the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat international terrorism; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) to work with the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat terrorism, including through effective measures to prevent and prohibit the financing of terrorists by Saudi institutions and citizens; and
<br>
<br>"(B) provides an assessment of the progress made by Saudi Arabia since 2001 on the matters described in subparagraph (A), including—
<br>
<br>"(i) whether Saudi Arabia has become a party to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the activities and authority of the Saudi Nongovernmental National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad.
<br>
<br>"(2) Form.—The report required by paragraph (1) shall be transmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if necessary."
<br>
<br>[For definition of "appropriate congressional committees" as used in section 2043 of Pub. L. 110–53, set out above, see section 2002 of Pub. L. 110–53, set out as a note under section 2151 of this title.]

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–458, title VII, §7101, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3775, provided that: "Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Long-term success in the war on terrorism demands the use of all elements of national power, including diplomacy, military action, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense.
<br>
<br>"(2) To win the war on terrorism, the United States must assign to economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority that is assigned to military capabilities.
<br>
<br>"(3) The legislative and executive branches of the Government of the United States must commit to robust, long-term investments in all of the tools necessary for the foreign policy of the United States to successfully accomplish the goals of the United States.

<br>
<br>"(1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of the United States relies on international cooperation.
<br>
<br>"(2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of United States Government contacts with foreign governments concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a comprehensive and unified approach to counterterrorism.
<br>
<br>"(b) In General.—The Secretary of State is authorized in consultation with relevant United States Government agencies, to negotiate on a bilateral or multilateral basis, as appropriate, international agreements under which parties to an agreement work in partnership to address and interdict acts of international terrorism.
<br>
<br>"(c) International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the President—
<br>
<br>"(A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop with those other governments a comprehensive multilateral strategy to fight terrorism; and
<br>
<br>"(B) to that end, should seek to establish an international counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international means for discussing and coordinating the development of important counterterrorism policies by the participating governments.
<br>
<br>"(2) Authority.—The President is authorized to establish an international counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for the following purposes:
<br>
<br>"(A) To meet annually, or more frequently as the President determines appropriate, to develop in common with such other governments important policies and a strategy that address the various components of international prosecution of the war on terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating to terrorist sanctuaries.
<br>
<br>"(B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President and leaders of other participating governments determine appropriate, long-term issues that can contribute to strengthening stability and security in the Middle East."
<br>International Agreements To Track and Curtail Terrorist Travel Through the Use of Fraudulently Obtained Documents
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–458, title VII, §7204, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3814, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) International terrorists travel across international borders to raise funds, recruit members, train for operations, escape capture, communicate, and plan and carry out attacks.

<br>
<br>"(6) Two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were carrying passports that had been manipulated in a fraudulent manner.
<br>
<br>"(7) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission), stated that 'Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money.'.
<br>
<br>"(b) International Agreements To Track and Curtail Terrorist Travel.—
<br>
<br>"(1) International agreement on lost, stolen, or falsified documents.—The President should lead efforts to track and curtail the travel of terrorists by supporting the drafting, adoption, and implementation of international agreements, and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions to track and stop international travel by terrorists and other criminals through the use of lost, stolen, or falsified documents to augment United Nations and other international anti-terrorism efforts.
<br>
<br>"(2) Contents of international agreement.—The President should seek, as appropriate, the adoption or full implementation of effective international measures to—
