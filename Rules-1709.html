<br>
<br>Section 1082(g) of that Act, which defined "POW/MIA flag" as used in section 1082 by reference to section 2 of Public Law 101–355, is unnecessary because the two provisions are restated together in section 902 of title 36.
<br>
<br>Section 1082(h), which required that regulations be prescribed no later than 180 days after enactment of Public law 105–85, is repealed as executed.
<br>
<br>Section 1082(i), which required that the Administrator of GSA procure and distribute POW/MIA flags no later than 30 days after enactment of Public Law 105–85, is repealed as executed.

<br>In this section, the word "terms" is omitted as included in "conditions".
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "or appropriations" are omitted because of 1:1. In clauses (1) and (5), the words "duties and powers" are substituted for "functions" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. In clause (2), the words "department, agency, or instrumentality" are substituted for "departments" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the text of 36:137 is omitted as superseded. The words "which has been or may after June 26, 1946, be" and "Provided, That this subsection shall not be effective until the expiration of the Surplus Property Act of 1944" are omitted as obsolete. Section 38 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (ch. 479, 58 Stat. 784) provided that the Act was to expire 3 years after the cessation of hostilities of World War II. The cessation of hostilities was proclaimed on December 31, 1946, by Proclamation No. 2714, 12 Fed. Reg. 1. However, section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 399) [renumbered by section 6(a) and (b) of the Act of September 5, 1950 (ch. 849, 64 Stat. 583)] repealed the Surplus Property Act of 1944 effective July 1, 1949 (except for sections 13(d), (g), and (h), 28, and 32(b)(2)). Section 13(d), concerning power transmission lines, and section 13(g), concerning property for public airports, do not involve the American Battle Monuments Commission. Section 13(h) was repealed by section 2 of the Act of August 4, 1972 (Public Law 92–362, 86 Stat. 504). Section 28 was repealed by section 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 868). Section 32(b)(2) was repealed by section 111(a)(1) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public Law 87–256, 75 Stat. 538).

<br>
<br>When, as a result of combat operations, the Armed Forces establish military cemeteries in zones of operations outside the United States and the territories and possessions of the United States, the American Battle Monuments Commission and the Secretary of the Army, immediately on the cessation of hostilities, shall decide which of the cemeteries will become permanent cemeteries or, if they decide it is desirable, shall select new sites for the cemeteries at any other location. The Commission is solely responsible for the design and construction of the permanent cemeteries, and of all buildings, plantings, headstones, and other permanent improvements incidental to the cemeteries, except that—

<br>§2106. War memorials not built by the United States Government
<br>
<br>(a) Cooperation With Others.—The American Battle Monuments Commission may cooperate with citizens of the United States, States, municipalities, or associations desiring to build war memorials outside the continental limits of the United States in the way the Commission decides. An administrative agency of the United States Government may give assistance to build the memorial only if a plan for the memorial has been approved under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Control, Administration, and Maintenance of War Memorials.—(1) The Commission may assume responsibility for the control, administration, and maintenance of any war memorial built outside the United States by a citizen of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a State, a governmental authority (except a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government), a foreign agency, or a private association to commemorate the services of any of the Armed Forces in hostilities occurring since April 6, 1917, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the memorial is not built on the territory of the applicable former enemy; and
<br>
<br>(B) the sponsors of the memorial consent to the Commission assuming those responsibilities and transfer to the Commission all their rights and interests in the memorial.
<br>
<br>(2) If reasonable effort fails to locate the sponsors of a memorial, the Commission may assume responsibility for the memorial under this subsection by agreement with the appropriate foreign authorities. A decision of the Commission to assume responsibility for a war memorial under this subsection is final.
<br>
<br>(3) Sponsors of a war memorial for which the Commission assumes responsibility under this subsection may transfer amounts accumulated to maintain and repair the memorial to the Commission for use in carrying out this chapter. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall deposit transferred amounts as provided in section 2103(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Arrangements for Repair or Long-Term Maintenance of Memorials.—In assuming responsibility for a war memorial under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the Commission may arrange with the sponsors of the memorial to provide for repair or long-term maintenance of the memorial.

<br>
<br>(d) Fund for Arrangements for Repair or Long-Term Maintenance of Memorials.—(1) There is a fund in the Treasury that is available to the Commission for expenses of repair and long-term maintenance of memorials for which the Commission has made arrangements under subsection (c) of this section. The fund consists of—
<br>
<br>(A) amounts deposited into, and interest and proceeds credited to, the fund under paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) obligations obtained under paragraph (3) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall deposit into the fund the amounts that are accepted under subsection (c) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, obligations held in the fund.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall invest any part of the fund that the Commission decides is not required to meet current expenses. Each investment shall be made in an interest-bearing obligation of the United States Government, or an obligation that has its principal and interest guaranteed by the Government, that the Commission decides has a maturity suitable for the fund.
<br>
<br>(4) The Commission shall separately account for all amounts deposited in and expended from the fund for each war memorial for which an arrangement for repair or long-term maintenance is made under subsection (c) of this section.
<br>
<br>(e) Demolition of War Memorial Built in a Foreign Country and Disposition of Site.—The Commission may take necessary action to demolish any war memorial built outside the United States by a citizen of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a State, a governmental authority (except a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government), a foreign agency, or a private association and to dispose of the site of the memorial in a way the Commission decides is proper, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the appropriate foreign authorities agree to the demolition; and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) the sponsor of the memorial consents to the demolition; or
<br>
<br>(B) the memorial has fallen into disrepair and a reasonable effort by the Commission has failed—
<br>
<br>(i) to persuade the sponsor to maintain the memorial at a standard acceptable to the Commission; or
<br>
<br>(ii) to locate the sponsor.

<br>§2109. Foreign Currency Fluctuations Account
<br>
<br>(a) Establishment and Purpose.—There is an account in the Treasury known as the "Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American Battle Monuments Commission, Account". The Account shall be used to provide amounts, in addition to amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Commission, to pay the cost of salaries and expenses that exceeds the amount appropriated for salaries and expenses because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries occurring after a budget request for the Commission is submitted to Congress. The Account may not be used for any other purpose.

<br>
<br>(c) Transferred Amounts.—(1) Amounts in the Account may be transferred to amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Commission. Transferred amounts shall be merged with, and are available for the same time period as, the appropriation to which they are applied.
<br>
<br>(2) Amounts transferred from the Account may be transferred back—
<br>
<br>(A) if the amounts are not needed to pay obligations incurred because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries in the appropriation to which the amounts were originally transferred; or
<br>
<br>(B) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates or because other amounts are, or become, available to pay the obligations.
<br>
<br>(3) Amounts transferred to an appropriation under this subsection may not be transferred back to the Account after the end of the 2d fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the appropriation was available for obligation.
<br>
<br>(d) Recording of Obligations and Fluctuations in Exchange Rates.—An obligation of the Commission payable in the currency of a foreign country may be recorded as an obligation based on exchange rates used in preparing a budget submission.

<br>The words "section 2734 of title 10" and "section 2734" are substituted for "the first section of the Act entitled 'An Act to provide for the prompt settlement of claims for damages occasioned by Army, Navy, and Marine Corps forces in foreign countries', approved January 2, 1942 (55 Stat. 880, as amended; 31 U.S.C. 224d)" and "such Act", respectively, in section 12 (4th par.) of the Act of March 4, 1923 (ch. 283), as added by section 4(c)(3) of the Act of July 25, 1956 (ch. 721, 70 Stat. 642), because of section 49(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640).

<br>(i) the Department of Defense does not need; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Commission requests to carry out the duties and powers specified in clause (A) of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) After a transfer under this subsection, the Commission shall maintain the cemetery and all improvements in it.

<br>§2113. World War II memorial in the District of Columbia
<br>
<br>(a) Solicitation and Acceptance of Contributions.—(1) Consistent with its authority under section 2103(e) of this title, the American Battle Monuments Commission shall solicit and accept contributions for the World War II memorial.
<br>
<br>(2) In this section, the term "World War II memorial" means the memorial authorized by Public Law 103–32 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) to be established by the Commission on Federal land in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and to commemorate the participation of the United States in that war.
<br>
<br>(b) Creation of Memorial Fund.—(1) There is hereby created in the Treasury a fund for the World War II memorial, which shall consist of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Amounts deposited, and interest and proceeds credited, under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) Obligations obtained under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(C) The amount of surcharges paid to the Commission for the World War II memorial under the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act (31 U.S.C. 5112 note).
<br>
<br>(D) Amounts borrowed using the authority provided under subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(E) Any funds received by the Commission under section 2114 of this title in exchange for use of, or the right to use, any mark, copyright or patent.
<br>
<br>(2) The Chairman of the Commission shall deposit in the fund the amounts accepted as contributions under subsection (a). The Secretary of the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on, and the proceeds from sale or redemption of, obligations held in the fund.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest any portion of the fund that, as determined by the Chairman, is not required to meet current expenses. Each investment shall be made in an interest-bearing obligation of the United States or an obligation guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States that, as determined by the Chairman, has a maturity suitable for the fund.
<br>
<br>(c) Use of Fund.—The fund shall be available to the Commission—
<br>
<br>(1) for the expenses of establishing the World War II memorial, including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in section 8906(b) of title 40;
<br>
<br>(2) for such other expenses, other than routine maintenance, with respect to the World War II memorial as the Commission considers warranted; and
<br>
<br>(3) to secure, obtain, register, enforce, protect, and license any mark, copyright, or patent that is owned by, assigned to, or licensed to the Commission under section 2114 of this title to aid or facilitate the construction of the World War II memorial.
<br>
<br>(d) Special Borrowing Authority.—(1) To assure that groundbreaking, construction, and dedication of the World War II memorial are carried out on a timely basis, the Commission may borrow money from the Treasury of the United States in such amounts as the Commission considers necessary, but not to exceed a total of $65,000,000. Borrowed amounts shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the month in which the obligations of the Commission are issued. The interest payments on such obligations may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary, but any interest payment so deferred shall also bear interest.
<br>
<br>(2) The borrowing of money by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be subject to such maturities, terms, and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary, except that the maturities may not exceed 20 years and such borrowings may be redeemable at the option of the Commission before maturity.
<br>
<br>(3) The obligations of the Commission shall be issued in amounts and at prices approved by the Secretary. The authority of the Commission to issue obligations under this subsection shall remain available without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligations of the Commission to be issued under this subsection, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction of the United States the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of the Commission's obligations under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) Repayment of the interest and principal on any funds borrowed by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be made from amounts in the fund. The Commission may not use for such purpose any funds appropriated for any other activities of the Commission.
<br>
<br>(e) Treatment of Borrowing Authority.—In determining whether the Commission has sufficient funds to complete construction of the World War II memorial, as required by section 8906 of title 40, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider the funds that the Commission may borrow from the Treasury under subsection (d) as funds available to complete construction of the memorial, whether or not the Commission has actually exercised the authority to borrow such funds.
<br>
<br>(f) Voluntary Services.—(1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31, the Commission may accept from any person voluntary services to be provided in furtherance of the fund-raising activities of the Commission relating to the World War II memorial.
<br>
<br>(2) A person providing voluntary services under this subsection shall be considered to be a Federal employee for purposes of chapter 81 of title 5, relating to compensation for work-related injuries, and chapter 171 of title 28, relating to tort claims. A volunteer who is not otherwise employed by the United States shall not be considered to be a Federal employee for any other purpose by reason of the provision of such voluntary service, except that any volunteer given responsibility for the handling of funds or the carrying out of a Federal function is subject to the conflict of interest laws contained in chapter 11 of title 18 and the administrative standards of conduct contained in part 2635 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission may provide for reimbursement of incidental expenses that are incurred by a person providing voluntary services under this subsection. The Commission shall determine those expenses that are eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any Federal employee to work without compensation or to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace any Federal employee.
<br>
<br>(g) Treatment of Certain Contracts.—A contract entered into by the Commission for the design or construction of the World War II memorial is not a funding agreement as that term is defined in section 201 of title 35.
<br>
<br>(h) Extension of Authority To Establish Memorial.—Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, the authority for the construction of the World War II memorial provided by Public Law 103–32 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) expires on December 31, 2005.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Support for Holocaust Education Programs
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–141, May 29, 2020, 134 Stat. 636, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Never Again Education Act'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The United States has demonstrated a commitment to remembrance and education about the Holocaust through bilateral relationships and engagement in international organizations such as the United Nations and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance; the United States works to promote Holocaust education as a means to understand the importance of democratic principles, use and abuse of power, and to raise awareness about the importance of genocide prevention today.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Congress has played a critical role in preserving the memory of the Holocaust and promoting awareness, including by authorizing the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as an independent establishment of the Federal Government to ensure that 'the study of the Holocaust become part of the curriculum in every school system in the country', as well as by establishing a national Holocaust Remembrance Day in 1978.
<br>
<br>"(3) 75 years after the conclusion of World War II, with the decreasing number of eyewitnesses and growing distance of students and their families from this history, it is important to institutionalize education about the events of the Holocaust such as the German Nazis' racist ideology, propaganda, and plan to lead a state to war and, with their collaborators, kill millions—including the systematic murder of 6,000,000 Jewish people; as well as the persecution and murder of millions of others in the name of racial purity, political, ideological, and behavioral grounds, among them Roma, the disabled, the Slavs, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals.
<br>
<br>"(4) As intolerance, antisemitism, and bigotry are promoted by hate groups, Holocaust education provides a context in which to learn about the danger of what can happen when hate goes unchallenged and there is indifference in the face of the oppression of others; learning how and why the Holocaust happened is an important component of the education of citizens of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(5) Today, those who deny that the Holocaust occurred or distort the true nature of the Holocaust continue to find forums, especially online; this denial and distortion dishonors those who were persecuted, and murdered, making it even more of a national imperative to educate students in the United States so that they may explore the lessons that the Holocaust provides for all people, sensitize communities to the circumstances that gave rise to the Holocaust, and help youth be less susceptible to the falsehood of Holocaust denial and distortion and to the destructive messages of hate that arise from Holocaust denial and distortion.
<br>
<br>"(6) Currently, 12 States (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) require by law that schools teach students about the Holocaust; more schools and teachers, including those in underserved communities, can and should deliver quality Holocaust education.
<br>
<br>"(7) For more than 30 years, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has worked to build and support the field of Holocaust education, and advance the quality and sustainability of Holocaust education at the local, State, and national levels, by engaging teachers and students across disciplines and grade levels.
<br>
<br>"(8) The Federal Government, through support for educational activities of national museums established under Federal law, can assist teachers in efforts to incorporate historically accurate instruction on human rights atrocities, including the Holocaust, in curricula.
<br>"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
<br>
<br>"In this Act:
<br>
