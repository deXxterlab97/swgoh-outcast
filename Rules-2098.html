The words "or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or any territory or possession of the United States" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

<br>A person that violates section 44102 or 44103 of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000, plus $200 for each passage sold, to be assessed by the Federal Maritime Commission.

<br>
<br>(1) sufficient to carry the waterborne domestic commerce and a substantial part of the waterborne export and import foreign commerce of the United States and to provide shipping service essential for maintaining the flow of the waterborne domestic and foreign commerce at all times;
<br>
<br>(2) capable of serving as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency;
<br>
<br>(3) owned and operated as vessels of the United States by citizens of the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) composed of the best-equipped, safest, and most suitable types of vessels constructed in the United States and manned with a trained and efficient citizen personnel; and
<br>
<br>(5) supplemented by efficient facilities for building and repairing vessels.
<br>
<br>(b) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States to encourage and aid the development and maintenance of a merchant marine satisfying the objectives described in subsection (a).

<br>
<br>(a) In General.—The Secretary of Transportation shall survey the merchant marine of the United States to determine whether replacements and additions are required to carry out the objectives and policy of section 50101 of this title. The Secretary shall study, perfect, and adopt a long-range program for replacements and additions that will result, as soon as practicable, in—
<br>
<br>(1) an adequate and well-balanced merchant fleet, including vessels of all types, that will provide shipping service essential for maintaining the flow of foreign commerce by vessels designed to be readily and quickly convertible into transport and supply vessels in a time of national emergency;
<br>
<br>(2) ownership and operation of the fleet by citizens of the United States insofar as practicable;
<br>
<br>(3) vessels designed to afford the best and most complete protection for passengers and crew against fire and all marine perils; and
<br>
<br>(4) an efficient capacity for building and repairing vessels in the United States with an adequate number of skilled personnel to provide an adequate mobilization base.
<br>
<br>(b) Cooperation With Secretary of Navy.—In carrying out subsection (a)(1), the Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate closely with the Secretary of the Navy as to national defense requirements.

In making such a determination, the Secretary shall consider and give due weight to—

<br>
<br>(B) the probability that a line cannot be maintained except at a heavy loss disproportionate to the benefit to foreign trade;

<br>(2) Saint lawrence seaway.—For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall establish services, routes, and lines that reflect the seasonal closing of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and provide for alternate routing of vessels through a different range of ports during that closing to maintain continuity of service on a year-round basis.
<br>
<br>(b) Bulk Cargo Carrying Services.—The Secretary shall investigate, determine, and keep current records of the bulk cargo carrying services that should be provided by vessels of the United States (whether or not operating on particular services, routes, or lines) for the promotion, development, expansion, and maintenance of the foreign commerce of the United States and the national defense or other national requirements.
<br>
<br>(c) Types of Vessels.—The Secretary shall investigate, determine, and keep current records of the type, size, speed, method of propulsion, and other requirements of the vessels, including express-liner or super-liner vessels, that should be employed in—

<br>
<br>(2) the bulk cargo carrying services described in subsection (b).

<br>
<br>(d) Express-Liner and Super-Liner Vessels.—The Secretary shall study and cooperate with vessel owners in devising means by which there may be constructed, by or with the aid of the United States Government, express-liner or super-liner vessels comparable to those of other nations, especially with a view to their use in a national emergency, and the use of transoceanic aircraft service in connection with or in lieu of those vessels.

<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "Director of the Office of Management and Budget" are substituted for "Bureau of the Budget" in the Act of June 2, 1951 (ch. 121, 65 Stat. 59), because of sections 101 and 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (5 App. U.S.C.) and 31 U.S.C. ch. 5. The words "for the purposes of that appropriation" are omitted for clarity and for consistency in the subsection.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "notwithstanding any other provisions of law" and "and consolidated with" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), in paragraph (1), the words "Comptroller General" are substituted for "Government Accountability Office" for consistency in the revised title. Paragraph (3) is substituted for "(except in cases where section 1212 of this Appendix is applicable)" because section 1212 applies to all vessels under a construction-differential subsidy contract.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the words "On and after June 20, 1956", and the last proviso in the 4th complete par. at 70 Stat. 319 (46 App. U.S.C. 1241b note), are omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In subsection (g), the words "beginning July 1, 1956" and "after July 1, 1956" are omitted as obsolete.

<br>§50302. Port development
<br>
<br>(a) General Requirements.—With the objective of promoting, encouraging, and developing ports and transportation facilities in connection with water commerce over which the Secretary of Transportation has jurisdiction, the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Army, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) investigate territorial regions and zones tributary to ports, taking into consideration the economies of transportation by rail, water, and highway and the natural direction of the flow of commerce;
<br>
<br>(2) investigate the causes of congestion of commerce at ports and applicable remedies;
<br>
<br>(3) investigate the subject of water terminals, including the necessary docks, warehouses, and equipment, to devise and suggest the types most appropriate for different locations and for the most expeditious and economical transfer or interchange of passengers or property between water carriers and rail carriers;
<br>
<br>(4) consult with communities on the appropriate location and plan of construction of wharves, piers, and water terminals;
<br>
<br>(5) investigate the practicability and advantages of harbor, river, and port improvements in connection with foreign and coastwise trade; and
<br>
<br>(6) investigate any other matter that may tend to promote and encourage the use by vessels of ports adequate to care for the freight that naturally would pass through those ports.
<br>
<br>(b) Submission of Findings to Surface Transportation Board.—After an investigation under subsection (a), if the Secretary of Transportation believes that the rates or practices of a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board are detrimental to the objective specified in subsection (a), or that new rates or practices, new or additional port terminal facilities, or affirmative action by a rail carrier is necessary to promote that objective, the Secretary may submit findings to the Board for action the Board considers appropriate under existing law.
<br>
<br>(c) Port and Intermodal Improvement Program.—
<br>
<br>(1) General authority.—Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of Transportation shall make grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible applicants to assist in funding eligible projects for the purpose of improving the safety, efficiency, or reliability of the movement of goods through ports and intermodal connections to ports.
<br>
