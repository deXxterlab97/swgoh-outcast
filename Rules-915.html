<br>Division I—Trade Readjustment Allowances
<br>§2291. Qualifying requirements for workers
<br>(a) Trade readjustment allowance conditions
<br>
<br>Payment of a trade readjustment allowance shall be made to an adversely affected worker covered by a certification under subpart A of this part who files an application for such allowance for any week of unemployment which begins on or after the date of such certification, if the following conditions are met:
<br>
<br>(1) Such worker's total or partial separation before the worker's application under this part occurred—
<br>
<br>(A) on or after the date, as specified in the certification under which the worker is covered, on which total or partial separation began or threatened to begin in the adversely affected employment,
<br>
<br>(B) before the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the determination under section 2273 of this title was made, and
<br>
<br>(C) before the termination date (if any) determined pursuant to section 2273(d) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Such worker had, in the 52-week period ending with the week in which such total or partial separation occurred, at least 26 weeks of employment at wages of $30 or more a week in adversely affected employment with a single firm, or, if data with respect to weeks of employment with a firm are not available, equivalent amounts of employment computed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. For the purposes of this paragraph, any week in which such worker—
<br>
<br>(A) is on employer-authorized leave for purposes of vacation, sickness, injury, maternity, or inactive duty or active duty military service for training,
<br>
<br>(B) does not work because of a disability that is compensable under a workmen's compensation law or plan of a State or the United States,
<br>
<br>(C) had his employment interrupted in order to serve as a full-time representative of a labor organization in such firm, or
<br>
<br>(D) is on call-up for purposes of active duty in a reserve status in the Armed Forces of the United States, provided such active duty is "Federal service" as defined in section 8521(a)(1) of title 5,
<br>
<br>shall be treated as a week of employment at wages of $30 or more, but not more than 7 weeks, in case of weeks described in subparagraph (A) or (C), or both (and not more than 26 weeks, in the case of weeks described in subparagraph (B) or (D)), may be treated as weeks of employment under this sentence.
<br>
<br>(3) Such worker—
<br>
<br>(A) was entitled to (or would be entitled to if the worker applied therefor) unemployment insurance for a week within the benefit period (i) in which such total or partial separation took place, or (ii) which began (or would have begun) by reason of the filing of a claim for unemployment insurance by such worker after such total or partial separation;
<br>
<br>(B) has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance, except additional compensation that is funded by a State and is not reimbursed from any Federal funds, to which the worker was entitled (or would be entitled if the worker applied therefor); and
<br>
<br>(C) does not have an unexpired waiting period applicable to the worker for any such unemployment insurance.
<br>
<br>(4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.
<br>
<br>(5) Such worker—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) is enrolled in a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296(a) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the enrollment required under clause (i) occurs no later than the latest of—
<br>
<br>(I) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs after the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after such total separation,
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs before the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after the date of such certification,
<br>
<br>(III) 45 days after the date specified in subclause (I) or (II), as the case may be, if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period,
<br>
<br>(IV) in the case of a worker who fails to enroll by the date required by subclause (I), (II), or (III), as the case may be, due to the failure to provide the worker with timely information regarding the date specified in such subclause, the last day of a period determined by the Secretary, or
<br>
<br>(V) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c),
<br>
<br>(B) has, after the date on which the worker became totally separated, or partially separated, from the adversely affected employment, completed a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296(a) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(C) has received a written statement under subsection (c)(1) after the date described in subparagraph (B).
<br>(b) Withholding of trade readjustment allowance pending beginning or resumption of participation in training program; period of applicability
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the adversely affected worker—
<br>
<br>(i) has failed to begin participation in the training program the enrollment in which meets the requirement of subsection (a)(5), or
<br>
<br>(ii) has ceased to participate in such training program before completing such training program, and
<br>
<br>(B) there is no justifiable cause for such failure or cessation, or
<br>
<br>(2) the certification made with respect to such worker under subsection (c)(1) is revoked under subsection (c)(2),
<br>
<br>no trade readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker under this division for the week in which such failure, cessation, or revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title.
<br>(c) Waivers of training requirements
<br>(1) Issuance of waivers
<br>
<br>The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:
<br>(A) Health
<br>
<br>The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.
<br>(B) Enrollment unavailable
<br>
<br>The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.
<br>(C) Training not available
<br>
<br>Training approved by the Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in section 2302 of title 20, and employers), no training that is suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable cost, or no training funds are available.
<br>(2) Duration of waivers
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), a waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.
<br>(B) Revocation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall revoke a waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in writing of the revocation.
<br>(3) Agreements under section 2311
<br>(A) Issuance by cooperating States
<br>
<br>An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall authorize a cooperating State to issue waivers as described in paragraph (1).
<br>(B) Review of waivers
<br>
<br>An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall require a cooperating State to review each waiver issued by the State under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(i) 3 months after the date on which the State issues the waiver; and
<br>
<br>(ii) on a monthly basis thereafter.
<br>(C) Submission of statements
<br>
<br>An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall include a requirement that the cooperating State submit to the Secretary the written statements provided under paragraph (1) and a statement of the reasons for the waiver.

<br>§2292. Weekly amounts of readjustment allowance
<br>(a) Formula
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (b), (c), and (d), the trade readjustment allowance payable to an adversely affected worker for a week of unemployment shall be an amount equal to the most recent weekly benefit amount of the unemployment insurance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title) reduced (but not below zero) by—
<br>
<br>(1) any training allowance deductible under subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(2) income that is deductible from unemployment insurance under the disqualifying income provisions of the applicable State law or Federal unemployment insurance law, except that in the case of an adversely affected worker who is participating in training under this part, such income shall not include earnings from work for such week that are equal to or less than the most recent weekly benefit amount of the unemployment insurance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title).
<br>(b) Adversely affected workers who are undergoing training
<br>
<br>Any adversely affected worker who is entitled to trade readjustment allowances and who is undergoing training approved by the Secretary shall receive for each week in which he is undergoing any such training, a trade readjustment allowance in an amount (computed for such week) equal to the amount computed under subsection (a) or (if greater) the amount of any weekly allowance for such training to which he would be entitled under any other Federal law for the training of workers, if he applied for such allowance. Such trade readjustment allowance shall be paid in lieu of any training allowance to which the worker would be entitled under such other Federal law.
<br>(c) Deduction from total number of weeks of allowance entitlement
<br>
<br>If a training allowance under any Federal law other than this chapter is paid to an adversely affected worker for any week of unemployment with respect to which he would be entitled (determined without regard to any disqualification under section 2291(b) of this title) to a trade readjustment allowance if he applied for such allowance, each such week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of trade readjustment allowance otherwise payable to him under section 2293(a) of this title when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance. If such training allowance paid to such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the trade readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a trade readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.
<br>(d) Election of trade readjustment allowance or unemployment insurance
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title, an adversely affected worker may elect to receive a trade readjustment allowance instead of unemployment insurance during any week with respect to which the worker—
<br>
<br>(1) is entitled to receive unemployment insurance as a result of the establishment by the worker of a new benefit year under State law, based in whole or in part upon part-time or short-term employment in which the worker engaged after the worker's most recent total separation from adversely affected employment; and
<br>
<br>(2) is otherwise entitled to a trade readjustment allowance.

<br>§2293. Limitations on trade readjustment allowances
<br>(a) Maximum allowance; deduction for unemployment insurance; additional payments for approved training periods
<br>
<br>(1) The maximum amount of trade readjustment allowances payable with respect to the period covered by any certification to an adversely affected worker shall be the amount which is the product of 52 multiplied by the trade readjustment allowance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment (as determined under section 2292(a) of this title), but such product shall be reduced by the total sum of the unemployment insurance to which the worker was entitled (or would have been entitled if he had applied therefor) in the worker's first benefit period described in section 2291(a)(3)(A) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) A trade readjustment allowance under paragraph (1) shall not be paid for any week occurring after the close of the 104-week period that begins with the first week following the week in which the adversely affected worker was most recently totally separated from adversely affected employment—
<br>
<br>(A) within the period which is described in section 2291(a)(1) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to which the worker meets the requirements of section 2291(a)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in order to assist the adversely affected worker to complete a training program approved for the worker under section 2296 of this title, and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, payments may be made as trade readjustment allowances for up to 65 additional weeks in the 78-week period that—
<br>
<br>(A) follows the last week of entitlement to trade readjustment allowances otherwise payable under this part; or
<br>
<br>(B) begins with the first week of such training, if such training begins after the last week described in subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>Payments for such additional weeks may be made only for weeks in such 78-week period during which the individual is participating in such training.
<br>(b) Adjustments of amounts payable
<br>
<br>Amounts payable to an adversely affected worker under this division shall be subject to such adjustment on a week-to-week basis as may be required by section 2292(b) of this title.
<br>(c) Special adjustments for benefit years ending with extended benefit periods
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or other Federal law, if the benefit year of a worker ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits that such worker would, but for this subsection, be entitled to in that extended benefit period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the number of weeks for which the worker was entitled, during such benefit year, to trade readjustment allowances under this division. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "benefit year" and "extended benefit period" shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.
<br>(d) Week during which worker received on-the-job training
<br>
<br>No trade readjustment allowance shall be paid to a worker under this division for any week during which the worker is receiving on-the-job training.
<br>(e) Workers treated as participating in training
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, a worker shall be treated as participating in training during any week which is part of a break in training that does not exceed 30 days if—
<br>
<br>(1) the worker was participating in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title before the beginning of such break in training, and
<br>
<br>(2) the break is provided under such training program.
<br>(f) Payment of trade readjustment allowances to complete training
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in order to assist an adversely affected worker to complete training approved for the worker under section 2296 of this title that leads to the completion of a degree or industry-recognized credential, payments may be made as trade readjustment allowances for not more than 13 weeks within such period of eligibility as the Secretary may prescribe to account for a break in training or for justifiable cause that follows the last week for which the worker is otherwise entitled to a trade readjustment allowance under this part if—
<br>
<br>(1) payment of the trade readjustment allowance for not more than 13 weeks is necessary for the worker to complete the training;
<br>
<br>(2) the worker participates in training in each such week; and
<br>
<br>(3) the worker—
<br>
<br>(A) has substantially met the performance benchmarks established as part of the training approved for the worker;
<br>
<br>(B) is expected to continue to make progress toward the completion of the training; and
<br>
<br>(C) will complete the training during that period of eligibility.
<br>(g) Special rule for calculating separation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any period during which a judicial or administrative appeal is pending with respect to the denial by the Secretary of a petition under section 2273 of this title shall not be counted for purposes of calculating the period of separation under subsection (a)(2).
<br>(h) Special rule for justifiable cause
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that there is justifiable cause, the Secretary may extend the period during which trade readjustment allowances are payable to an adversely affected worker under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) (but not the maximum amounts of such allowances that are payable under this section).
<br>(i) Special rule with respect to military service
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary may waive any requirement of this part that the Secretary determines is necessary to ensure that an adversely affected worker who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces and serves a period of duty described in paragraph (2) is eligible to receive a trade readjustment allowance, training, and other benefits under this part in the same manner and to the same extent as if the worker had not served the period of duty.
<br>(2) Period of duty described
<br>
<br>An adversely affected worker serves a period of duty described in this paragraph if, before completing training under section 2296 of this title, the worker—
<br>
<br>(A) serves on active duty for a period of more than 30 days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 days; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a member of the Army National Guard of the United States or Air National Guard of the United States, performs full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) of title 32 for 30 consecutive days or more when authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds.

<br>§2296. Training
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>(1) If the Secretary determines, with respect to an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent worker, that—
<br>
<br>(A) there is no suitable employment (which may include technical and professional employment) available for an adversely affected worker,
<br>
<br>(B) the worker would benefit from appropriate training,
<br>
<br>(C) there is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training,
<br>
<br>(D) training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in section 2302 of title 20, and employers) 1
<br>
<br>(E) the worker is qualified to undertake and complete such training, and
<br>
<br>(F) such training is suitable for the worker and available at a reasonable cost,
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall approve such training for the worker. Upon such approval, the worker shall be entitled to have payment of the costs of such training (subject to the limitations imposed by this section) paid on the worker's behalf by the Secretary directly or through a voucher system.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The total amount of funds available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title shall not exceed $450,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2021.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable after the beginning of each fiscal year, make an initial distribution of the funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title, in accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary shall ensure that not less than 90 percent of the funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title for a fiscal year are distributed to the States by not later than July 15 of that fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(C)(i) In making the initial distribution of funds pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall hold in reserve 35 percent of the funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title for that fiscal year for additional distributions during the remainder of the fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(ii) Subject to clause (iii), in determining how to apportion the initial distribution of funds pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) in a fiscal year, the Secretary shall take into account, with respect to each State—
<br>
<br>(I) the trend in the number of workers covered by certifications of eligibility under this part during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;
<br>
<br>(II) the trend in the number of workers participating in training under this section during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;
<br>
<br>(III) the number of workers estimated to be participating in training under this section during the fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(IV) the amount of funding estimated to be necessary to provide training approved under this section to such workers during the fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(V) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title.
<br>
<br>(iii) In no case may the amount of the initial distribution to a State pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) in a fiscal year be less than 25 percent of the initial distribution to the State in the preceding fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary shall establish procedures for the distribution of the funds that remain available for the fiscal year after the initial distribution required under subparagraph (B)(i). Such procedures may include the distribution of funds pursuant to requests submitted by States in need of such funds.
<br>
<br>(E) If, during a fiscal year, the Secretary estimates that the amount of funds necessary to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title will exceed the dollar amount limitation specified in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall decide how the amount of funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title that have not been distributed at the time of the estimate will be apportioned among the States for the remainder of the fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of employment does not require that employment opportunities for a worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of training approved under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If the costs of training an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent worker are paid by the Secretary under paragraph (1), no other payment for such costs may be made under any other provision of Federal law.
<br>
<br>(B) No payment may be made under paragraph (1) of the costs of training an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent worker if such costs—
<br>
<br>(i) have already been paid under any other provision of Federal law, or
<br>
<br>(ii) are reimbursable under any other provision of Federal law and a portion of such costs have already been paid under such other provision of Federal law.
<br>
<br>(C) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the costs incurred in training a particular adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker, even if such use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker.
<br>
<br>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (10), the training programs that may be approved under paragraph (1) include, but are not limited to—

<br>(F) any training program (other than a training program described in paragraph (7)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of training the worker are paid—
<br>
<br>(i) under any Federal or State program other than this part, or
<br>
<br>(ii) from any source other than this section,
<br>
<br>(G) any other training program approved by the Secretary, and

<br>
<br>(i) obtaining a degree or certification; or
<br>
<br>(ii) completing a degree or certification that the worker had previously begun at an accredited institution of higher education.
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not limit approval of a training program under paragraph (1) to a program provided pursuant to title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act [29 U.S.C. 3111 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The Secretary is not required under paragraph (1) to pay the costs of any training approved under paragraph (1) to the extent that such costs are paid—
<br>
<br>(i) under any Federal or State program other than this part, or
<br>
<br>(ii) from any source other than this section.
<br>
<br>(B) Before approving any training to which subparagraph (A) may apply, the Secretary may require that the adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the Secretary will not be required to pay under this section the portion of the costs of such training that the worker has reason to believe will be paid under the program, or by the source, described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary shall not approve a training program if—
<br>
<br>(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,
<br>
<br>(B) the adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and
<br>
<br>(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under this part, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.
<br>
<br>(8) The Secretary may approve training for any adversely affected worker who is a member of a group certified under subpart A of this part at any time after the date on which the group is certified under subpart A of this part, without regard to whether such worker has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance to which the worker is entitled.
<br>
<br>(9)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which set forth the criteria under each of the subparagraphs of paragraph (1) that will be used as the basis for making determinations under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(B)(i) In determining under paragraph (1)(E) whether a worker is qualified to undertake and complete training, the Secretary may approve training for a period longer than the worker's period of eligibility for trade readjustment allowances under division I if the worker demonstrates a financial ability to complete the training after the expiration of the worker's period of eligibility for such trade readjustment allowances.
<br>
<br>(ii) In determining the reasonable cost of training under paragraph (1)(F) with respect to a worker, the Secretary may consider whether other public or private funds are reasonably available to the worker, except that the Secretary may not require a worker to obtain such funds as a condition of approval of training under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(10) In the case of an adversely affected incumbent worker, the Secretary may not approve—
<br>
<br>(A) on-the-job training under paragraph (5)(A)(i); or
<br>

<br>(2) payments for travel expenses exceeding the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations.
<br>(c) On-the-job training requirements
