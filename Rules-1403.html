<br>(1) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>(2) there exists a unique Federal responsibility to Indians;
<br>
<br>(3) through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indians;
<br>
<br>(4) the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to Indians also are founded in part on specific commitments made through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast tracts of land, which provided legal consideration for permanent, ongoing performance of Federal trust duties; and
<br>
<br>(5) the foregoing historic Federal-tribal relations and understandings have benefitted the people of the United States as a whole for centuries and have established enduring and enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.

<br>Congress finds that—

<br>
<br>(2) entrepreneurs that want to provide products and services in reservation communities face an additional set of challenges that requires special knowledge;
<br>
<br>(3) a business incubator is an organization that assists entrepreneurs in navigating obstacles that prevent innovative ideas from becoming viable businesses by providing services that include—
<br>
<br>(A) workspace and facilities resources;
<br>
<br>(B) access to capital, business education, and counseling;
<br>
<br>(C) networking opportunities;
<br>
<br>(D) mentorship opportunities; and
<br>
<br>(E) an environment intended to help establish and expand business operations;
