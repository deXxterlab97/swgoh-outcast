<br>

<br>
<br>(c) Oversight.—The Secretary, in consultation with State Historic Preservation Officers, shall establish oversight methods to ensure State program consistency and quality without imposing undue review burdens on State Historic Preservation Officers.
<br>
<br>(d) State Fiscal Audit and Management System.—

<br>
<br>(A) establishes and maintains substantially similar accountability standards; and
<br>
<br>(B) provides for independent professional peer review.
<br>
<br>(2) Fiscal audits and review by secretary.—The Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) may conduct periodic fiscal audits of State programs approved under this subdivision as needed; and
