<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or as otherwise provided under a provision of this chapter, a commissioned officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps 1 of the Public Health Service is entitled to special pay under a provision of this chapter in the same amounts, and under the same terms and conditions, as a commissioned officer of the armed forces is entitled to special pay under that provision.

<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary concerned may establish, by regulations, procedures for determining the amount of the repayment required under this subsection and the circumstances under which an exception to the required repayment may be granted. The Secretary concerned may specify in the regulations the conditions under which an installment payment of a bonus or similar benefit to be paid to a member of the uniformed services will not be made if the member no longer satisfies the eligibility requirements for the bonus or similar benefit. For the military departments, this subsection shall be administered under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.

<br>
<br>(ii) may grant an exception to the requirement to terminate the payment of any unpaid amounts of a bonus, incentive pay, or similar benefit if the Secretary concerned determines that termination of the payment of the unpaid amounts would be contrary to a personnel policy or management objective, would be against equity and good conscience, or would be contrary to the best interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) In this paragraph, the term "sole survivorship discharge" means the separation of a member from the Armed Forces, at the request of the member, pursuant to the Department of Defense policy permitting the early separation of a member who is the only surviving child in a family in which—

<br>(II) was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If a member of the uniformed services dies or is retired or separated with a combat-related disability, the Secretary concerned—
<br>
<br>(i) shall not require repayment by the member or the member's estate of the unearned portion of any bonus or similar benefit previously paid to the member; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall require the payment to the member or the member's estate of the remainder of any bonus or similar benefit that was not yet paid to the member, but to which the member was entitled immediately before the death, retirement, or separation of the member, and would be paid if not for the death, retirement, or separation of the member.
<br>
<br>(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if the death or disability of the member is the result of the member's misconduct.
<br>
<br>(C) The amount to be paid under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be equal to the full amount specified by the agreement or contract applicable to the bonus or similar benefit as if the member continued to be entitled to the bonus or similar benefit following the death, retirement, or separation.
<br>
<br>(D) Amounts to be paid to a member or the member's estate under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid in a lump sum not later than 90 days after the date of the death, retirement, or separation of the member, whichever applies.
<br>
<br>(E) In this paragraph, the term "combat-related disability" has the meaning given that term in section 1413a(e) of title 10.
<br>
<br>(4) An obligation to repay the United States under this subsection is, for all purposes, a debt owed the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not discharge a person from such debt if the discharge order is entered less than five years after—
<br>
<br>(A) the date of the termination of the agreement or contract on which the debt is based; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the absence of such an agreement or contract, the date of the termination of the service on which the debt is based.
<br>
<br>(5) In this subsection:
<br>
<br>(A) The term "bonus or similar benefit" means a bonus, incentive pay, special pay, or similar payment, or an educational benefit or stipend, paid to a member of the uniformed services under a provision of law that refers to the repayment requirements of this subsection.
