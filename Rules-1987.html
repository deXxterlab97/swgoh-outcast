<br>(3) In making grants and entering into contracts under this subsection, special consideration shall be given to entities which establish or will establish programs to provide training for persons fifty years of age and older who wish to become paraprofessionals (including homemaker home health aides) to provide home health services.
<br>
<br>(4) Applications for grants and contracts under this subsection shall be in such form and contain such information as the Secretary shall prescribe.
