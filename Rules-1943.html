<br>§8701. Findings and purposes
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the location of the seat of government in the District of Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and Virginia;
<br>
<br>(2) effective comprehensive planning is necessary on a regional basis and of continuing importance to the federal establishment;
<br>
<br>(3) the distribution of federal installations throughout the region has been and will continue to be a major influence in determining the extent and character of development;
<br>
<br>(4) there is needed a central planning agency for the National Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of the many different agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments so that those activities may conform with general objectives;
<br>
<br>(5) there is an increasing mutuality of interest and responsibility between the various levels of government that calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both federal and local development in the interest of order and economy;
<br>
<br>(6) there are developmental problems of an interstate character, the planning of which requires collaboration between federal, state, and local governments in the interest of equity and constructive action; and
<br>
<br>(7) the instrumentalities and procedures provided in this chapter will aid in providing Congress with information and advice requisite to legislation.
<br>
<br>(b) Purposes.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The purposes of this chapter (except sections 8733–8736) are—
<br>
<br>(A) to secure comprehensive planning for the physical development of the National Capital and its environs;
<br>
<br>(B) to provide for the participation of the appropriate planning agencies of the environs in the planning; and
<br>
<br>(C) to establish the agency and procedures requisite to the administration of the functions of the Federal and District Governments related to the planning.
<br>
<br>(2) Objective.—The general objective of this chapter (except sections 8733–8736) is to enable appropriate agencies to plan for the development of the federal establishment at the seat of government in a manner—
<br>
<br>(A) consistent with the nature and function of the National Capital and with due regard for the rights and prerogatives of the adjoining States and local governments to exercise control appropriate to their functions; and
<br>
<br>(B) which will, in accordance with present and future needs, best promote public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development.

<br>
<br>In this chapter, the word "Mayor" is substituted for "Commissioners" [meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia] [subsequently changed to "Commissioner" [meaning the Commissioner of the District of Columbia] because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public Law 93–198, 87 Stat. 789). The words "Council of the District of Columbia" are substituted for "Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia" [subsequently changed to "District of Columbia Council" because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87 Stat. 785, 787).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words "the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives" are substituted for "and the chairman of the Committees of the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives" in section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the "Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977"), approved February 4, 1977, section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104–14, 2:21 note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th Congress, January 6, 1999).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the words "bona fide" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(3), the words "except that of the members first appointed, the President shall designate one to serve two years and one to serve four years" and "The members first appointed under this section shall assume their office on January 2, 1975" are omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(4), the words "are entitled to $100 a day when performing duties" are substituted for "shall each receive compensation at the rate of $100 for each day such member is engaged in the actual performance of duties" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53" are substituted for "the civil service and classification laws" because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89–554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words "As hereinafter more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title" are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff. Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words "in such capacity" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Subsection (f) is substituted for 40:71h to eliminate obsolete language.
<br>
<br>In subsection (g), the words "Said Commission shall report to Congress annually on the first Monday of March the lands acquired during the preceding fiscal year, the method of acquisition, and the cost of each tract" are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note). See, also, page 180 of House Document No. 103–7. The words "Office of Management and Budget" are substituted for "Bureau of the Budget" in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.
<br>
<br>In subsection (h), the words "beginning in fiscal year 1998 and thereafter" are omitted as obsolete.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—PLANNING PROCESS
<br>§8721. Comprehensive plan for the National Capital
<br>
<br>(a) Preparation and Adoption by Commission.—The National Capital Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital. The plan shall include the Commission's recommendations or proposals for federal developments or projects in the environs and District elements of the comprehensive plan, or amendments to the elements, adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia and with respect to which the Commission has not determined a negative impact exists. Those elements or amendments shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan without change. The Commission may include in its plan any part of a plan adopted by any planning agency in the environs and may make recommendations of collateral interest to the agencies. The Commission may adopt any part of an element. The Commission shall review and may amend or extend the plan so that its recommendations may be kept up to date.
<br>
<br>(b) Review by District of Columbia.—The Mayor of the District of Columbia shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan, and any amendment, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings. Following adoption and prior to implementation, the Council shall submit each element or amendment to the Commission for review and comment with regard to the impact of the element or amendment on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital.
<br>
<br>(c) Commission Response to Council Action.—
<br>
<br>(1) Period of review.—Within 60 days after receiving an element or amendment from the Council, the Commission shall certify to the Council whether the element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital.
<br>
<br>(2) No negative impact.—If the Commission takes no action in the 60-day period, the element or amendment is deemed to have no negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and implemented.
<br>
<br>(3) Negative impact.—
<br>
<br>(A) Certification to council.—If the Commission finds a negative impact, it shall certify its findings and recommendations to the Council.
<br>
<br>(B) Response of council.—On receipt of the Commission's findings and recommendations, the Council may—
<br>
<br>(i) accept the findings and recommendations and modify the element or amendment accordingly; or
<br>
<br>(ii) reject the findings and recommendations and resubmit a modified form of the element or amendment to the Commission for reconsideration.
<br>
<br>(C) Findings and recommendations accepted.—If the Council accepts the findings and recommendations and modifies the element or amendment, the Council shall submit the element or amendment to the Commission for the Commission to determine whether the modification has been made in accordance with the Commission's findings and recommendations. If the Commission does not act on the modified element or amendment within 30 days after receiving it, the element or amendment is deemed to have been modified in accordance with the findings and recommendations and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and implemented. If within the 30-day period the Commission again determines the element or amendment has a negative impact on the functions or interests of the federal establishment in the National Capital, the element or amendment shall not be implemented.
<br>
<br>(D) Findings and recommendations rejected.—If the Council rejects the findings and recommendations and resubmits a modified element or amendment, the Commission, within 60 days after receiving it, shall decide whether the modified element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment within the National Capital. If the Commission does not act within the 60-day period, the modified element or amendment is deemed to have no negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and implemented. If the Commission finds a negative impact, it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council and the element or amendment shall not be implemented.
<br>
<br>(d) Resubmission Deemed New Element or Amendment.—Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined has a negative impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital which is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission is deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.
<br>
<br>(e) Review, Hearings, and Citizen Advisory Councils.—
<br>
<br>(1) Review.—Before the comprehensive plan, any element of the plan, or any revision is adopted, the Commission shall present the plan, element, or revision to the appropriate federal or District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations. The Commission may present the proposed revisions annually in a consolidated form. Recommendations by federal and District of Columbia authorities are not binding on the Commission, but the Commission shall give careful consideration to any views and recommendations submitted prior to final adoption.
<br>
<br>(2) Hearings and citizen advisory councils.—The Commission—
<br>
<br>(A) may provide periodic opportunity for review and comments by nongovernmental agencies or groups through public hearings, meetings, or conferences, exhibitions, and publication of its plans; and
<br>
<br>(B) in consultation with the Council, may encourage the formation of citizen advisory councils.
<br>
<br>(f) Extension of Time Limitations.—On request of the Commission, the Council may grant an extension of any time limitation contained in this section.
<br>
<br>(g) Publishing Comprehensive Plan.—As appropriate, the Commission and the Mayor jointly shall publish a comprehensive plan for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the comprehensive plan for the federal activities in the National Capital developed by the Commission and the District elements developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with this section.
<br>
<br>(h) Procedures for Consultation.—
<br>
<br>(1) Commission and mayor.—The Commission and the Mayor jointly shall establish procedures for appropriate meaningful continuing consultation throughout the planning process for the National Capital.
<br>
<br>(2) Government agencies.—In order that the National Capital may be developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the Commission, with the consent of each agency concerned as to its representation, may establish advisory and coordinating committees composed of representatives of agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments as may be necessary or helpful to obtain the maximum amount of cooperation and correlation of effort among the various agencies. As it considers appropriate, the Commission may invite representatives of the planning and developmental agencies of the environs to participate in the work of the committees.

The Commission on request shall furnish related plans, data, and records to federal and District of Columbia governmental agencies.
<br>
<br>(b) Consultation Between Agencies and Commission.—
<br>

After receiving the plans, maps, and data, the Commission promptly shall make a preliminary report and recommendations to the agency. If the agency, after considering the report and recommendations of the Commission, does not agree, it shall advise the Commission and provide the reasons why it does not agree. The Commission then shall submit a final report.

<br>
<br>(2) Commission action.—Before acting on any general plan, the Commission shall advise and consult with the appropriate planning agency having jurisdiction over the affected part of the environs. When the Commission decides that proposed developments or projects submitted to the Commission under subsection (b) involve a major change in the character or intensity of an existing use in the environs, the Commission shall advise and consult with the planning agency.

<br>
<br>Section 1 of the Act of December 23, 1963, referred to in subsec. (b)(2), is section 1 of Pub. L. 88–241, Dec. 23, 1963, 77 Stat. 478, which enacted general and permanent laws relating to judiciary and judicial procedure in the District of Columbia, and which is not classified to the Code.
<br>§8732. Acquiring land subject to limited rights reserved to grantor and limited permanent rights in land adjoining park property
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—The National Capital Planning Commission in accordance with this chapter may acquire, for and on behalf of the Federal Government, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation—
<br>
<br>(1) fee title to land subject to limited rights, but not for business purposes, reserved to the grantor; and
<br>
<br>(2) permanent rights in land adjoining park property sufficient to prevent the use of the land in certain specified ways which would essentially impair the value of the park property for its purposes.
<br>
<br>(b) Prerequisites to Acquisition.—
<br>
<br>(1) Fee title to land subject to limited rights.—The reservation of rights to the grantor shall not continue beyond the life of the grantor of the fee. The Commission must decide that the permanent public park purposes for which control over the land is needed are not essentially impaired by the reserved rights and that there is a substantial saving in cost by acquiring the land subject to the limited rights as compared with the cost of acquiring unencumbered title to the land.
<br>
<br>(2) Permanent rights in land adjoining park property.—The Commission must decide that the protection and maintenance of the essential public values of the park can be secured more economically by acquiring the permanent rights than by acquiring the land.
<br>
<br>(c) Presidential Approval Required.—All contracts to acquire land or rights under this section are subject to the approval of the President.
