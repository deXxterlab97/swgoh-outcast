<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13534. National Export Initiative
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13534, Mar. 11, 2010, 75 F.R. 12433, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Export Enhancement Act of 1992, Public Law 102–429, 106 Stat. 2186, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, in order to enhance and coordinate Federal efforts to facilitate the creation of jobs in the United States through the promotion of exports, and to ensure the effective use of Federal resources in support of these goals, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The economic and financial crisis has led to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs, and while the economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, millions of Americans remain unemployed or underemployed. Creating jobs in the United States and ensuring a return to sustainable economic growth is the top priority for my Administration. A critical component of stimulating economic growth in the United States is ensuring that U.S. businesses can actively participate in international markets by increasing their exports of goods, services, and agricultural products. Improved export performance will, in turn, create good high-paying jobs.
<br>
<br>The National Export Initiative (NEI) shall be an Administration initiative to improve conditions that directly affect the private sector's ability to export. The NEI will help meet my Administration's goal of doubling exports over the next 5 years by working to remove trade barriers abroad, by helping firms—especially small businesses—overcome the hurdles to entering new export markets, by assisting with financing, and in general by pursuing a Government-wide approach to export advocacy abroad, among other steps.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Export Promotion Cabinet. There is established an Export Promotion Cabinet to develop and coordinate the implementation of the NEI. The Export Promotion Cabinet shall consist of:
<br>

<br>

<br>(e) the Secretary of Labor;
<br>
<br>(f) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
<br>
<br>(g) the United States Trade Representative;
<br>
<br>(h) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy;
<br>
<br>(i) the National Security Advisor;
<br>
<br>(j) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
<br>
<br>(k) the President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
<br>
<br>(l) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
<br>
<br>(m) the President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation [now United States International Development Finance Corporation];
<br>
<br>(n) the Director of the United States Trade and Development Agency; and
<br>
<br>(o) the heads of other executive branch departments, agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.
<br>
<br>The Export Promotion Cabinet shall meet periodically and report to the President on the progress of the NEI. A member of the Export Promotion Cabinet may designate, to perform the NEI-related functions of that member, a senior official from the member's department or agency who is a full-time officer or employee. The Export Promotion Cabinet may also establish subgroups consisting of its members or their designees, and, as appropriate, representatives of other departments and agencies. The Export Promotion Cabinet shall coordinate with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), established by Executive Order 12870 of September 30, 1993.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. National Export Initiative. The NEI shall address the following:
<br>
<br>(a) Exports by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet shall develop programs, in consultation with the TPCC, designed to enhance export assistance to SMEs, including programs that improve information and other technical assistance to first-time exporters and assist current exporters in identifying new export opportunities in international markets.
<br>
<br>(b) Federal Export Assistance. Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, in consultation with the TPCC, shall promote Federal resources currently available to assist exports by U.S. companies.
<br>
<br>(c) Trade Missions. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the TPCC and, to the extent possible, with State and local government officials and the private sector, shall ensure that U.S. Government-led trade missions effectively promote exports by U.S. companies.
<br>
<br>(d) Commercial Advocacy. Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, in consultation with other departments and agencies and in coordination with the Advocacy Center at the Department of Commerce, shall take steps to ensure that the Federal Government's commercial advocacy effectively promotes exports by U.S. companies.
<br>
<br>(e) Increasing Export Credit. The President of the Export-Import Bank, in consultation with other members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, shall take steps to increase the availability of credit to SMEs.
<br>
<br>(f) Macroeconomic Rebalancing. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, shall promote balanced and strong growth in the global economy through the G20 Financial Ministers' process or other appropriate mechanisms.
<br>
<br>(g) Reducing Barriers to Trade. The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with other members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, shall take steps to improve market access overseas for our manufacturers, farmers, and service providers by actively opening new markets, reducing significant trade barriers, and robustly enforcing our trade agreements.
<br>
<br>(h) Export Promotion of Services. Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet shall develop a framework for promoting services trade, including the necessary policy and export promotion tools.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Report to the President. Not later than 180 days after the date of this order, the Export Promotion Cabinet, through the TPCC, shall provide the President a comprehensive plan to carry out the goals of the NEI. The Chairman of the TPCC shall set forth the steps taken to implement this plan in the annual report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives required by the Export Enhancement Act of 1992, Public Law 102–249 [102–429], 106 Stat. 2186, and Executive Order 12870, as amended.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or
<br>
<br>(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. Executive Order 13534 of March 11, 2010, created the National Export Initiative (NEI), which provides unprecedented Federal support for exports of goods and services by American businesses.

As part of these responsibilities, the Export Promotion Cabinet, in coordination with the Advocacy Center at the Department of Commerce, is focused on ensuring that the Federal Government's commercial advocacy effectively promotes exports by U.S. businesses, particularly by those firms competing for international contracts against foreign firms that may benefit from strong home government support. The creation of a new whole-of-government commercial advocacy task force that will provide enhanced Federal support for U.S. businesses competing for international contracts, coordinate the efforts of executive branch leadership in engaging their foreign counterparts on commercial advocacy issues, and increase the availability of information to the U.S. business community about these kinds of export opportunities, will ensure that U.S. exporters have more support for selling their goods and services in global markets.
<br>

<br>
<br>(a) The Task Force shall be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce (Chair) and consist of senior-level officials from the following executive departments and agencies (agencies) designated by the heads of those agencies:

<br>(b) coordinate the engagement of agency leadership with their foreign counterparts regarding commercial advocacy issues, particularly with respect to their foreign travel and other occasions for engagement with foreign officials, and evaluate reports on the outcomes of such engagement, in order to increase the number of senior-level agency officials regularly and effectively advocating on behalf of U.S. exporters;

<br>Maximizing the Effectiveness of Federal Programs and Functions Supporting Trade and Investment
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 17, 2012, 77 F.R. 10935, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Winning the future and creating an economy that's built to last will require the Federal Government to wisely allocate scarce resources to maximize efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. Creating good, high-paying jobs in the United States and ensuring sustainable economic growth are the top priorities of my Administration. To accomplish these goals, we must ensure that U.S. businesses increase their exports of goods, services, and agricultural products, and that foreign companies recognize the United States as an attractive place to invest and to open businesses. While this growth will be fueled by the private sector, the Federal Government must do its part to facilitate trade and investment.
<br>
<br>Executive Order 13534 of March 11, 2010, established the Export Promotion Cabinet to coordinate the development and implementation of the National Export Initiative (NEI) to improve conditions that directly affect the private sector's ability to export and to help meet my Administration's goal of doubling exports over 5 years. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, the Export Promotion Cabinet conducts its work in coordination with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). The TPCC, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, was authorized by statute in 1992 (15 U.S.C. 4727) and established by Executive Order 12870 of September 30, 1993. The NEI has used Government resources and policies to increase exports at a pace consistent with the goal of doubling exports by the end of 2014. The NEI has accomplished this by opening up foreign markets for U.S. exports, enhancing enforcement of our trade laws, providing needed export financing, advocating on behalf of U.S. firms, and otherwise facilitating U.S. exports. But we must do more.
<br>
<br>On January 13, 2012, I announced that I would submit a legislative proposal seeking the authority to reorganize the Federal Government in order to reduce costs and consolidate agencies (Consolidation Authority), and outlined the first use I would make of such authority: to streamline functions currently dispersed across numerous agencies into a single new department to promote competitiveness, exports, and American business. The new department would integrate and streamline trade negotiation, financing, promotion, and enforcement functions currently housed at half a dozen executive departments and agencies, and would include an office dedicated to expanding foreign investment and assisting businesses that are considering investing in the United States. In addition to the trade and investment functions, the new department would include integrated small business, technology, innovation, and statistics programs and services from a number of departments and agencies, thereby creating a one-stop shop for businesses that want to grow and export. We cannot afford to wait until the Congress acts, however, and must do all we can administratively to make the most efficient and effective use of the Federal Government's trade, foreign investment, export, and business programs and functions.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, to further enhance and coordinate Federal efforts to facilitate the creation of jobs in the United States and ensure sustainable economic growth through trade and foreign investment, and to ensure the effective and efficient use of Federal resources in support of these goals, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Program Coordination. In coordination with the TPCC, the Export Promotion Cabinet shall develop strategies and initiatives in support of my Administration's strategic trade and investment goals and priorities, including the specific measures outlined in this memorandum. The Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics shall coordinate the activities of the Export Promotion Cabinet pursuant to this memorandum. Measures and progress shall continue to be reported in the annual National Export Strategy report of the TPCC. The TPCC will continue to function as it has, consistent with its statutorily mandated duties.
<br>
<br>(2) Improving Customer Service for Exporters. Consistent with my memorandum of October 28, 2011 (Making it Easier for America's Small Businesses and America's Exporters to Access Government Services to Help Them Grow and Hire), the Export Promotion Cabinet shall support the Steering Committee established pursuant to that memorandum in its efforts to create BusinessUSA, a common, open, online platform and web service that will, among other things, enable exporters to seamlessly access information about export-related Government programs, resources, and services regardless of which agency provides them.
<br>
<br>(3) Trade Budget. The Export Promotion Cabinet shall, in consultation with the TPCC:
<br>
<br>(a) evaluate the allocation of Federal Government resources to assist with trade financing, negotiation, enforcement, and promotion, as well as the encouragement of foreign investment in the United States, and identify potential savings from streamlining overlapping or duplicative programs, as well as areas in need of additional resources;
<br>
<br>(b) make recommendations to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for more effective resource allocation to these functions, consistent with my Administration's strategic trade and investment goals and priorities, including recommendations to streamline overlapping and duplicative programs and reallocate those resources; and
<br>
<br>(c) present to the Director of OMB for consideration in the annual process for developing the President's Budget, a proposed unified Federal trade budget, consistent with my Administration's strategic trade and investment goals and priorities.
<br>
<br>(4) Coordination of Offices and Staff. The Export Promotion Cabinet, in consultation with the TPCC, shall take steps to ensure the most efficient use of its members' domestic and foreign offices and distribution networks, including: co-locating offices wherever appropriate; cross-training staff to better serve business customers at home and abroad by promoting exports to foreign countries and foreign investment in the United States; and considering the effectiveness of commercial diplomacy, cross-training, and referrals, as appropriate, when evaluating employee performance.
<br>
<br>(5) Enhancing Business Competitiveness. Pending passage of legislation providing Consolidation Authority, the Export Promotion Cabinet shall work with the National Economic Council to develop and coordinate administrative initiatives to align and enhance programs that enable and support efforts by American businesses, particularly small businesses, to innovate, grow, and increase exports.
<br>
<br>(6) General Provisions[.] (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<br>§4801. Findings and purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) efforts to reverse the decline of United States industry has been hindered by—
<br>
<br>(A) a serious erosion in the institutions and policies which foster United States competitiveness including a lack of high quality domestic and international economic and scientific data needed to—
<br>
<br>(i) reveal sectoral strengths and weaknesses;
<br>
<br>(ii) identify potential new markets and future technological and economic trends; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide necessary information regarding the competitive strategies of foreign competitors;
<br>
<br>(B) the lack of a coherent and consistent government competitiveness policy, including policies with respect to—
<br>
<br>(i) international trade, finance, and investment,
<br>
<br>(ii) research, science, and technology,
<br>
<br>(iii) education, labor retraining, and adjustment,
<br>
<br>(iv) macroeconomic and budgetary issues,
<br>
<br>(v) antitrust and regulation, and
<br>
<br>(vi) government procurement;
<br>
<br>(2) the United States economy benefits when business, labor, government, academia, and public interest groups work together cooperatively;
<br>
<br>(3) the decline of United States economic competitiveness endangers the ability of the United States to maintain the defense industrial base which is necessary to the national security of the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) the world is moving rapidly toward the creation of an integrated and interdependent economy, a world economy in which the policies of one nation have a major impact on other nations;
<br>
<br>(5) integrated solutions to such issues as trade and investment research, science, and technology, education, and labor retraining and adjustments help the United States compete more effectively in the world economy; and
<br>
<br>(6) government, business, labor, academia, and public interest groups shall cooperate to develop and coordinate long-range strategies to help assure the international competitiveness of the United States economy.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this chapter—
<br>
<br>(1) to develop recommendations for long-range strategies for promoting the international competitiveness of the United States industries; and
<br>
<br>(2) to establish the Competitiveness Policy Council which shall—
<br>
<br>(A) analyze information regarding the competitiveness of United States industries and business and trade policy;
<br>
<br>(B) create an institutional forum where national leaders with experience and background in business, labor, government, academia, and public interest activities shall—
<br>
<br>(i) identify economic problems inhibiting the competitiveness of United States agriculture, business, and industry;
<br>
<br>(ii) develop long-term strategies to address such problem; and
<br>
<br>(C) make recommendations on issues crucial to the development of coordinated competitiveness strategies;
<br>
<br>(D) publish analysis in the form of periodic reports and recommendations concerning the United States business and trade policy.
