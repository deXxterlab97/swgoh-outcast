<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>

<br>"(C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem;
<br>
<br>"(D) the testimony and documentation described in subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across the United States poses a barrier to full and fair participation in surface transportation-related businesses of women business owners and minority business owners and has impacted firm development and many aspects of surface transportation-related business in the public and private markets; and

<br>
<br>"(ii) socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (other than women); and

<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—The Secretary shall establish minimum uniform criteria for use by State governments in certifying whether a concern qualifies as a small business concern for the purpose of this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(B) Inclusions.—The minimum uniform criteria established under subparagraph (A) shall include, with respect to a potential small business concern—
<br>
<br>"(i) on-site visits;
<br>

<br>
<br>"(8) Sense of congress on prompt payment of dbe subcontractors.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(A) the Secretary should take additional steps to ensure that recipients comply with section 26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (the disadvantaged business enterprises prompt payment rule), or any corresponding regulation, in awarding federally funded transportation contracts under laws and regulations administered by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>"(B) such additional steps should include increasing the Department's ability to track and keep records of complaints and to make that information publicly available."

For purposes of this subsection, construction necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate System shall include, but not be limited to, any construction on the Interstate System which is required under a court order issued before the date of enactment of this sentence.
