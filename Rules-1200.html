<br>§2778a. Exportation of uranium depleted in the isotope 235

<br>In accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, the Secretary of State shall require adequate and timely reporting on political contributions, gifts, commissions and fees paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by any person in connection with—

<br>§2780. Transactions with countries supporting acts of international terrorism
<br>(a) Prohibited transactions by United States Government
<br>
<br>The following transactions by the United States Government are prohibited:
<br>
<br>(1) Exporting or otherwise providing (by sale, lease or loan, grant, or other means), directly or indirectly, any munitions item to a country described in subsection (d) under the authority of this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or any other law (except as provided in subsection (h)). In implementing this paragraph, the United States Government—
<br>
<br>(A) shall suspend delivery to such country of any such item pursuant to any such transaction which has not been completed at the time the Secretary of State makes the determination described in subsection (d), and
<br>
<br>(B) shall terminate any lease or loan to such country of any such item which is in effect at the time the Secretary of State makes that determination.
<br>
<br>(2) Providing credits, guarantees, or other financial assistance under the authority of this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or any other law (except as provided in subsection (h)), with respect to the acquisition of any munitions item by a country described in subsection (d). In implementing this paragraph, the United States Government shall suspend expenditures pursuant to any such assistance obligated before the Secretary of State makes the determination described in subsection (d). The President may authorize expenditures otherwise required to be suspended pursuant to the preceding sentence if the President has determined, and reported to the Congress, that suspension of those expenditures causes undue financial hardship to a supplier, shipper, or similar person and allowing the expenditure will not result in any munitions item being made available for use by such country.
<br>
<br>(3) Consenting under section 2753(a) of this title, under section 505(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2314(a)], under the regulations issued to carry out section 2778 of this title, or under any other law (except as provided in subsection (h)), to any transfer of any munitions item to a country described in subsection (d). In implementing this paragraph, the United States Government shall withdraw any such consent which is in effect at the time the Secretary of State makes the determination described in subsection (d), except that this sentence does not apply with respect to any item that has already been transferred to such country.
<br>
<br>(4) Providing any license or other approval under section 2778 of this title for any export or other transfer (including by means of a technical assistance agreement, manufacturing licensing agreement, or coproduction agreement) of any munitions item to a country described in subsection (d). In implementing this paragraph, the United States Government shall suspend any such license or other approval which is in effect at the time the Secretary of State makes the determination described in subsection (d), except that this sentence does not apply with respect to any item that has already been exported or otherwise transferred to such country.
<br>
<br>(5) Otherwise facilitating the acquisition of any munitions item by a country described in subsection (d). This paragraph applies with respect to activities undertaken—
<br>
<br>(A) by any department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Government,
<br>
<br>(B) by any officer or employee of the Government (including members of the United States Armed Forces), or
<br>
<br>(C) by any other person at the request or on behalf of the Government.
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State may waive the requirements of the second sentence of paragraph (1), the second sentence of paragraph (3), and the second sentence of paragraph (4) to the extent that the Secretary determines, after consultation with the Congress, that unusual and compelling circumstances require that the United States Government not take the actions specified in that sentence.
<br>(b) Prohibited transactions by United States persons
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A United States person may not take any of the following actions:
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) Selling, leasing, loaning, granting, or otherwise providing any munitions item to any country described in subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(C) Selling, leasing, loaning, granting, or otherwise providing any munitions item to any recipient which is not the government of or a person in a country described in subsection (d) if the United States person has reason to know that the munitions item will be made available to any country described in subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(D) Taking any other action which would facilitate the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of any munitions item by the government of any country described in subsection (d), or any person acting on behalf of that government, if the United States person has reason to know that that action will facilitate the acquisition of that item by such a government or person.
<br>(2) Liability for actions of foreign subsidiaries, etc.
<br>
<br>A United States person violates this subsection if a corporation or other person that is controlled in fact by that United States person (as determined under regulations, which the President shall issue) takes an action described in paragraph (1) outside the United States.
<br>(3) Applicability to actions outside the United States
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) applies with respect to actions described in that paragraph which are taken either within or outside the United States by a United States person described in subsection (l)(3)(A) or (B). To the extent provided in regulations issued under subsection (l)(3)(D), paragraph (1) applies with respect to actions described in that paragraph which are taken outside the United States by a person designated as a United States person in those regulations.
<br>(c) Transfers to governments and persons covered
<br>
<br>This section applies with respect to—
<br>
<br>(1) the acquisition of munitions items by the government of a country described in subsection (d); and
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) submits to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report containing—

<br>
<br>(ii) such articles and services are being used for the purposes for which they are provided.
<br>(b) Conduct of program
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) prevents the diversion (through reverse engineering or other means) of technology incorporated in defense articles.

<br>SUBCHAPTER IV—GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
<br>§2791. General provisions
<br>(a) Considerations in procurement outside United States
<br>
<br>In carrying out this chapter, special emphasis shall be placed on procurement in the United States, but, subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, consideration shall also be given to coproduction or licensed production outside the United States of defense articles of United States origin when such production best serves the foreign policy, national security, and economy of the United States. In evaluating any sale proposed to be made pursuant to this chapter, there shall be taken into consideration (A) the extent to which the proposed sale damages or infringes upon licensing arrangements whereby United States entities have granted licenses for the manufacture of the defense articles selected by the purchasing country to entities located in friendly foreign countries, which licenses result in financial returns to the United States, (B) the portion of the defense articles so manufactured which is of United States origin, and (C) whether, and the extent to which, such sale might contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements.
<br>(b) Information to Congress on credit sales and guaranties
<br>
<br>No credit sale shall be extended under section 2763 of this title, and no guarantee shall be issued under section 2764 of this title, in any case involving coproduction or licensed, production outside the United States of any defense article of United States origin unless the Secretary of State shall, in advance of any such transaction, advise the appropriate committees of the Congress and furnish the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate with full information regarding the proposed transaction, including, but not limited to, a description of the particular defense article or articles which would be produced under a license or coproduced outside the United States, the estimated value of such production or coproduction, and the probable impact of the proposed transaction on employment and production within the United States.
<br>(c) Availability of funds for procurement outside United States
<br>
<br>Funds made available under this chapter may be used for procurement outside the United States only if the President determines that such procurement will not result in adverse effects upon the economy of the United States or the industrial mobilization base, with special reference to any areas of labor surplus or to the net position of the United States in its balance of payments with the rest of the world, which outweigh the economic or other advantages to the United States of less costly procurement outside the United States.
<br>(d) Responsibility of Secretary of Defense with respect to sales and guaranties
<br>
<br>(1) With respect to sales and guaranties under sections 2761, 2762, 2763, 2764, 2769 and 2770 of this title, the Secretary of Defense shall, under the direction of the President, have primary responsibility for—
<br>
<br>(A) the determination of military end-item requirements;
<br>
<br>(B) the procurement of military equipment in a manner which permits its integration with service programs;
<br>
<br>(C) the supervision of the training of foreign military personnel;
<br>
<br>(D) the movement and delivery of military end-items; and
<br>
<br>(E) within the Department of Defense, the performance of any other functions with respect to sales and guaranties.
<br>
<br>(2) The establishment of priorities in the procurement, delivery, and allocation of military equipment shall, under the direction of the President, be determined by the Secretary of Defense.
<br>(e) Revocation and suspension provisions of contracts for sale and export licenses; appropriations for refunds
<br>
<br>(1) Each contract for sale entered into under sections 2761, 2762, 2769 and 2770 of this title, and each contract entered into under section 2767(d) of this title, shall provide that such contract may be canceled in whole or in part, or its execution suspended, by the United States at any time under unusual or compelling circumstances if the national interest so requires.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Each export license issued under section 2778 of this title shall provide that such license may be revoked, suspended, or amended by the Secretary of State, without prior notice, whenever the Secretary deems such action to be advisable.
<br>
<br>(B) Nothing in this paragraph may be construed as limiting the regulatory authority of the President under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) There are authorized to be appropriated from time to time such sums as may be necessary (A) to refund moneys received from purchasers under contracts of sale entered into under sections 2761, 2762, 2769 and 2770 of this title, or under contracts entered into under section 2767(d) of this title, that are canceled or suspended under this subsection to the extent such moneys have previously been disbursed to private contractors and United States Government agencies for work in progress, and (B) to pay such damages and costs that accrue from the corresponding cancellation or suspension of the existing procurement contracts or United States Government agency work orders involved.
<br>(f) Use of civilian contract personnel in foreign countries
<br>
<br>The President shall, to the maximum extent possible and consistent with the purposes of this chapter, use civilian contract personnel in any foreign country to perform defense services sold under this chapter.

<br>(a) Establishment; purposes; special requirements and responsibilities; continuous orders for certain articles and services; articles for narcotics control purposes
<br>
<br>(1) Under the direction of the President and in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a Special Defense Acquisition Fund (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the "Fund"), to be used as a revolving fund separate from other accounts, under the control of the Department of Defense, to finance the acquisition of defense articles and defense service in anticipation of their transfer pursuant to this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or as otherwise authorized by law, to eligible foreign countries and international organizations, and may acquire such articles and services with the funds in the Fund as he may determine. Acquisition under this subchapter of items for which the initial issue quantity requirements for United States Armed Forces have not been fulfilled and are not under current procurement contract shall be emphasized when compatible with security assistance requirements for the transfer of such items.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to limit or impair any responsibilities conferred upon the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense under this chapter or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(3) The Fund may be used to keep on continuous order such defense articles and defense services as are assigned by the Department of Defense for integrated management by a single agency thereof for the common use of all military departments in anticipation of the transfer of similar defense articles and defense services to foreign countries and international organizations pursuant to this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or other law.
<br>
<br>(4) The Fund shall also be used to acquire defense articles that are particularly suited for use for narcotics control purposes and are appropriate to the needs of recipient countries, such as small boats, planes (including helicopters), and communications equipment.
<br>(b) Collections in Fund
<br>
<br>The Fund shall consist of—
<br>
<br>(1) collections from sales made under letters of offer issued pursuant to section 2761(a)(1)(A) of this title representing the actual value of defense articles not intended to be replaced in stock,
<br>
<br>(2) collections from sales representing the value of asset use charges (including contractor rental payments for United States Government-owned plant and production equipment) and charges for the proportionate recoupment of nonrecurring research, development, and production costs, and
<br>
<br>(3) collections from sales made under letters of offer (or transfers made under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.]) of defense articles and defense services acquired under this subchapter, representing the value of such items calculated in accordance with subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 2761(a)(1) of this title or section 2762 of this title or section 644(m) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2403(m)], as appropriate,
<br>
<br>together with such funds as may be authorized and appropriated or otherwise made available for the purposes of the Fund.
<br>(c) Amounts
<br>
<br>(1) The size of the Fund may not exceed such dollar amount as is prescribed in section 114(c) of title 10. For purposes of this limitation, the size of the Fund is the amounts in the Fund plus the value (in terms of acquisition cost) of the defense articles acquired under this subchapter which have not been transferred from the Fund in accordance with this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Amounts in the Fund shall be available for obligation in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

<br>SUBCHAPTER VI—LEASES OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND LOAN AUTHORITY FOR COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES
<br>§2796. Leasing authority
<br>(a) Preconditions
<br>
<br>The President may lease defense articles in the stocks of the Department of Defense to an eligible foreign country or international organization if—
<br>
<br>(1) he determines that there are compelling foreign policy and national security reasons for providing such articles on a lease basis rather than on a sales basis under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(2) he determines that the articles are not for the time needed for public use;
<br>
<br>(3) the President first considers the effects of the lease of the articles on the national technology and industrial base, particularly the extent, if any, to which the lease reduces the opportunities of entities in the national technology and industrial base to sell new equipment to the country or countries to which the articles are leased; and
<br>
<br>(4) the country or international organization has agreed to pay in United States dollars all costs incurred by the United States Government in leasing such articles, including reimbursement for depreciation of such articles while leased, the costs of restoration or replacement if the articles are damaged while leased, and, if the articles are lost or destroyed while leased—
<br>
<br>(A) in the event the United States intends to replace the articles lost or destroyed, the replacement cost (less any depreciation in the value) of the articles; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the event the United States does not intend to replace the articles lost or destroyed, an amount not less than the actual value (less any depreciation in the value) specified in the lease agreement.
<br>
<br>The requirement of paragraph (4) shall not apply to leases entered into for purposes of cooperative research or development, military exercises, or communications or electronics interface projects. The President may waive the requirement of paragraph (4) for reimbursement of depreciation for any defense article which has passed three-quarters of its normal service life if the President determines that to do so is important to the national security interest of the United States. The President may waive the requirement of paragraph (4) with respect to a lease which is made in exchange with the lessee for a lease on substantially reciprocal terms of defense articles for the Department of Defense, except that this waiver authority—
<br>
<br>(A) may be exercised only if the President submits to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, in accordance with the regular notification procedures of those Committees, a detailed notification for each lease with respect to which the authority is exercised; and
<br>
<br>(B) may be exercised only during the fiscal year 1 the current fiscal year and only with respect to one country, unless the Congress hereafter provides otherwise.
<br>
<br>The preceding sentence does not constitute authorization of appropriations for payments by the United States for leased articles.
<br>(b) Duration; termination
<br>
<br>(1) Each lease agreement under this section shall be for a fixed duration which may not exceed (A) five years, and (B) a specified period of time required to complete major refurbishment work of the leased articles to be performed prior to the delivery of the leased articles, and shall provide that, at any time during the duration of the lease, the President may terminate the lease and require the immediate return of the leased articles.
<br>
<br>(2) In this subsection, the term "major refurbishment work" means work for which the period of performance is 6 months or more.
<br>(c) Applicable statutory authorities
<br>
<br>Defense articles in the stocks of the Department of Defense may be leased or loaned to a foreign country or international organization only under the authority of this subchapter or chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2311 et seq.], and may not be leased to a foreign country or international organization under the authority of section 2667 of title 10.
