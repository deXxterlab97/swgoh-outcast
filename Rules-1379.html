<br>In approving or disapproving a Minerals Agreement, the Secretary shall determine if it is in the best interest of the Indian tribe or of any individual Indian who may be party to such agreement and shall consider, among other things, the potential economic return to the tribe; the potential environmental, social, and cultural effects on the tribe; and provisions for resolving disputes that may arise between the parties to the agreement: Provided, That the Secretary shall not be required to prepare any study regarding environmental, socioeconomic, or cultural effects of the implementation of a Minerals Agreement apart from that which may be required under section 4332(2)(C) of title 42.
<br>(c) Prior notice of proposed finding; privileged information
<br>
<br>Not later than thirty days prior to formal approval or disapproval of any Minerals Agreement, the Secretary shall provide written findings forming the basis of his intent to approve or disapprove such agreement to the affected Indian tribe. Notwithstanding any other law, such findings and all projections, studies, data or other information possessed by the Department of the Interior regarding the terms and conditions of the Minerals Agreement, the financial return to the Indian parties thereto, or the extent, nature, value or disposition of the Indian mineral resources, or the production, products or proceeds thereof, shall be held by the Department of the Interior as privileged proprietary information of the affected Indian or Indian tribe.
<br>(d) Delegation; final action; appeal; burden on Secretary
<br>
<br>The authority to disapprove agreements under this section may only be delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs. The decision of the Secretary or, where authority is delegated, of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, to disapprove a Minerals Agreement shall be deemed a final agency action. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's disapproval action and shall determine the matter de novo. The burden is on the Secretary to sustain his action.
<br>(e) Nonliability of United States; continuing obligations
<br>
<br>Where the Secretary has approved a Minerals Agreement in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provision of law, the United States shall not be liable for losses sustained by a tribe or individual Indian under such agreement: Provided, That the Secretary shall continue to have a trust obligation to ensure that the rights of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a violation of the terms of any Minerals Agreement by any other party to such agreement: Provided further, That nothing in this chapter shall absolve the United States from any responsibility to Indians, including those which derive from the trust relationship and from any treaties, Executive orders, or agreement between the United States and any Indian tribe.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–382, §4, Dec. 22, 1982, 96 Stat. 1938.)
<br>§2104. Secretary's review of prior Minerals Agreements
<br>(a) Time; criteria; notice of modifications; time for compliance; effect of noncompliance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall review, within ninety days of December 22, 1982, any existing Minerals Agreement, which does not purport to be a lease, entered into by any Indian tribe and approved by the Secretary after January 1, 1975, but prior to December 22, 1982, to determine if such agreement complies with the purposes of this chapter. Such review shall be limited to the terms of the agreement and shall not address questions of the parties' compliance therewith. The Secretary shall notify the affected tribe and other parties to the agreement of any modifications necessary to bring an agreement into compliance with the purposes of this chapter. The tribe and other parties to such agreement shall within ninety days after notice make such modifications. If such modifications are not made within ninety days, the provisions of this chapter may not be used as a defense in any proceeding challenging the validity of the agreement.
<br>(b) Review before promulgation of regulations; not Federal action
<br>
<br>The review required by subsection (a) of this section may be performed prior to the promulgation of regulations required under section 2107 of this title and shall not be considered a Federal action within the meaning of that term in section 4332(2)(C) of title 42.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–382, §5, Dec. 22, 1982, 96 Stat. 1939.)

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–382, §6, Dec. 22, 1982, 96 Stat. 1940.)
<br>§2106. Assistance to tribes or individuals during Minerals Agreement negotiations
<br>
<br>In carrying out the obligations of the United States, the Secretary shall ensure that upon the request of an Indian tribe or individual Indian and to the extent of his available resources, such tribe or individual Indian shall have available advice, assistance, and information during the negotiation of a Minerals Agreement. The Secretary may fulfill this responsibility either directly through the use of Federal officials and resources or indirectly by providing financial assistance to the Indian tribe or individual Indian to secure independent assistance.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–382, §7, Dec. 22, 1982, 96 Stat. 1940.)
<br>§2107. Regulations; consultation with Indian organizations; pending agreements
<br>
<br>Within one hundred and eighty days of December 22, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior shall promulgate rules and regulations to facilitate implementation of this chapter. The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, consult with national and regional Indian organizations and tribes with expertise in mineral development both in the initial formulation of rules and regulations and any future revision or amendment of such rules and regulations. Where there is pending before the Secretary for his approval a Minerals Agreement of the type authorized by section 2102 of this title which was submitted prior to December 22, 1982, the Secretary shall evaluate and approve or disapprove such agreement based upon section 2103 of this title, but shall not withhold or delay such approval or disapproval on the grounds that the rules and regulations implementing this chapter have not been promulgated.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–382, §8, Dec. 22, 1982, 96 Stat. 1940.)

<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–374, §2, Oct. 27, 2004, 118 Stat. 1773, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Act of February 8, 1887 (commonly known as the 'Indian General Allotment Act') (25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.), which authorized the allotment of Indian reservations, did not permit Indian allotment owners to provide for the testamentary disposition of the land that was allotted to them;
<br>
<br>"(2) that Act provided that allotments would descend according to State law of intestate succession based on the location of the allotment;
<br>
<br>"(3) the reliance of the Federal Government on the State law of intestate succession with respect to the descent of allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian tribes, members of Indian tribes, and the Federal Government, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) the increasingly fractionated ownership of trust and restricted land as that land is inherited by successive generations of owners as tenants in common;
<br>
<br>"(B) the application of different rules of intestate succession to each interest of a decedent in or to trust or restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries of more than 1 State, which application—
<br>
<br>"(i) makes probate planning unnecessarily difficult; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) impedes efforts to provide probate planning assistance or advice;
<br>
<br>"(C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust and restricted land, which makes it difficult for Indian tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; and
<br>
<br>"(D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for many of the essential elements of general probate law, either directly or by reference, which—
<br>
<br>"(i) is unfair to the owners of trust and restricted land (and heirs and devisees of owners); and
<br>
<br>"(ii) makes probate planning more difficult;
<br>
<br>"(4) a uniform Federal probate code would likely—
<br>
<br>"(A) reduce the number of fractionated interests in trust or restricted land;
<br>
<br>"(B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning assistance and advice and create incentives for owners of trust and restricted land to engage in estate planning;
<br>
<br>"(C) facilitate intertribal efforts to produce tribal probate codes in accordance with section 206 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and
<br>
<br>"(D) provide essential elements of general probate law that are not applicable on the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 2004] to interests in trust or restricted land; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the provisions of a uniform Federal probate code and other forth [sic] in this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note above] should operate to further the policy of the United States as stated in the Indian Land Consolidated Act Amendments of 2000, Public Law 106–462, [§]102, November 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1992 [set out as a note below]."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–462, title I, §101, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1991, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership;
<br>
<br>"(3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owner's consent;
<br>
<br>"(4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners;
<br>
<br>"(5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely;
<br>
<br>"(6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total interests;
<br>
<br>"(7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;
<br>
<br>"(8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue to be made;
<br>
<br>"(9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high;
<br>
<br>"(10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S[.] Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found the application of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thousands of undivided interests in trust and restricted lands;
<br>
<br>"(11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and
<br>
<br>"(B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests 'to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206';
<br>
<br>"(12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponentially;
<br>
<br>"(13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands described in this section is the result of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and requires a solution under Federal law.[;]
<br>
<br>"(14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and
<br>
<br>"(15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Government should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that reservation."

<br>"(1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians;
<br>
<br>"(2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels;
<br>
<br>"(3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty;

<br>
<br> Any consent required by this clause must be in writing and acknowledged before a notary public (or other official authorized to make acknowledgments), and shall be approved by the Secretary unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the consent was obtained as a result of fraud or undue influence.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a partition is approved under this subsection and an owner of an interest in the parcel of land refuses to surrender possession in accordance with the partition decision, or refuses to execute any conveyance necessary to implement the partition, then any affected owner or the United States may—
