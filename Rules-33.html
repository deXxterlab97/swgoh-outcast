<br>The companies of Sheba waited for them—
<br>20They were ashamed because they had hoped;
<br>They came thither, and were confounded.
<br>21For now ye are become His; Ye see a terror, and are afraid. 22Did I say: ‘Give unto me’?
<br>Or: ‘Offer a present for me of your substance’?
<br>23or: ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’?
<br>Or: ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?
<br>
<br>24Teach me, and I will hold my peace;
<br>And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
<br>25How forcible are words of uprightness!
<br>But what doth your arguing argue?
<br>26Do ye hold words to be an argument,
<br>But the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind?
<br>27Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless,
<br>And dig a pit for your friend.
<br>28Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;
<br>For surely I shall not lie to your face.
<br>29Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;
<br>Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
<br> 
<br>30Is there injustice on my tongue?
<br>Cannot my taste discern crafty devices?
<br>
<br>Is there not a time of service to man upon earth?
<br>And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
<br>2As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow,
<br>And as a hireling that looketh for his wages;
<br>3So am I made to possess—months of vanity,
<br>And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
<br>4When I lie down, I say: ‘When shall I arise?’
<br>But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
<br>5My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
<br>My skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.
<br>6My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
<br>And are spent without hope.
<br>7O remember that my life is a breath;
<br>Mine eye shall no more see good.
<br>8The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;
<br>While Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone.
<br>9As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,
<br>So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
<br> 
<br>10He shall return no more to his house,
<br>Neither shall his place know him any more.
<br>
<br>11Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
<br>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
<br>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
<br>12Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That Thou settest a watch over me?
<br>13When I say: ‘My bed shall comfort me,
<br>My couch shall ease my complaint’;
<br>14Then Thou scarest me with dreams,
<br>And terrifiest me through visions;
<br>15So that my soul chooseth strangling,
<br>And death rather than these my bones.
<br>16I loathe it; I shall not live alway;
<br>Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
<br>17What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him,
<br>And that Thou shouldest set Thy heart upon him,
<br>18And that Thou shouldest remember him every morning,
<br>And try him every moment?
<br>19How long wilt Thou not look away from me,
<br>Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
<br>20If I have sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men?
<br> 
<br>Why hast Thou set me as a mark for Thee,
<br>So that I am a burden to myself?
<br>21And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression,
<br>And take away mine iniquity?
<br>For now shall I lie down in the dust;
<br>And Thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be.
<br>
<br>Then	answered	Bildad	the Shuhite, and said:
<br>2How long wilt thou speak these things,
<br>Seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind?
<br>3Doth God pervert judgment?
<br>Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
<br>4If thy children sinned against Him,
<br>He delivered them into the hand of their transgression.
<br>5If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto God,
<br>And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
<br>6If thou wert pure and upright;
<br>Surely now He would awake for thee,
<br>And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
<br>7And though thy beginning was small,
<br>Yet thy end should greatly increase.
<br>
<br>8For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation,
<br>And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out—
<br> 
<br>9For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
<br>Because our days upon earth are a shadow—
<br>10Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
<br>And utter words out of their heart?
<br>11Can the rush shoot up without mire?
<br>Can the reed-grass grow without water?
<br>12Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down,
<br>It withereth before any other herb.
<br>13So are the paths of all that forget God;
<br>And the hope of the godless man shall perish;
<br>14Whose confidence is gossamer, And whose trust is a spider’s web. 15He shall lean upon his house, but it
<br>shall not stand;
<br>He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
<br>16He is green before the sun,
<br>And his shoots go forth over his garden.
<br>17His roots are wrapped about the heap,
<br>He beholdeth the place of stones.
<br>18If he be destroyed from his place,
<br>Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen thee.’
<br>19Behold, this is the joy of his way,
<br>And out of the earth shall others spring.
<br>20Behold, God will not cast away an innocent man,
<br> 
<br>Neither will He uphold the evil- doers;
<br>21Till He fill thy mouth with laughter,
<br>And thy lips with shouting.
<br>22They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
<br>And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2Of a truth I know that it is so; And how can man be just with God? 3If one should desire to contend with
<br>Him,
<br>He could not answer Him one of a thousand.
<br>4He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength;
<br>Who hath hardened himself against Him, and prospered?
<br>5Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not,
<br>When He overturneth them in His anger.
<br>6Who shaketh the earth out of her place,
<br>And the pillars thereof tremble.
<br>7Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;
<br>And sealeth up the stars.
<br>8Who alone stretcheth out the heavens,
<br>And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
<br>9Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
<br>And the chambers of the south.
<br> 
<br>10Who doeth great things past finding out;
<br>Yea, marvellous things without number.
<br>11Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him not.
<br>He passeth on also, but I perceive Him not.
<br>12Behold, He snatcheth away, who can hinder Him?
<br>Who will say unto Him: ‘What doest Thou?’
<br>13God will not withdraw His anger;
<br>The helpers of Rahab did stoop under Him.
<br>
<br>14How much less shall I answer Him,
<br>And choose out my arguments with Him?
<br>15Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;
<br>I would make supplication to Him that contendeth with me.
<br>16If I had called, and He had answered me;
<br>Yet would I not believe that He would hearken unto my voice—
<br>17He that would break me with a tempest,
<br>And multiply my wounds without cause;
<br>18That would not suffer me to take my breath,
<br>But fill me with bitterness.
<br>19If it be a matter of strength, lo, He is mighty!
<br>And if of justice, who will appoint me a time?
<br> 
<br>20Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me;
<br>Though I be innocent, He shall prove me perverse.
<br>21I am innocent—I regard not myself,
<br>I despise my life.
<br>22It is all one—therefore I say:
<br>He destroyeth the innocent and the wicked.
<br>23If the scourge slay suddenly,
<br>He will mock at the calamity of the guiltless.
<br>24The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
<br>He covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
<br>If it be not He, who then is it?
<br>25Now my days are swifter than a runner;
<br>They flee away, they see no good.
<br>26They are passed away as the swift ships;
<br>As the vulture that swoopeth on the prey.
<br>27If I say: ‘I will forget my complaint,
<br>I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer’,
<br>28I am afraid of all my pains,
<br>I know that Thou wilt not hold me guiltless.
<br>29I shall be condemned;
<br>Why then do I labour in vain?
<br>30If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean; 31Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the
<br>ditch,
<br> 
<br>And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
<br>32For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him,
<br>That we should come together in judgment.
<br>33There is no arbiter betwixt us,
<br>That might lay his hand upon us both.
<br>34Let Him take His rod away from me,
<br>And let not His terror make me afraid;
<br>5Then would I speak, and not fear Him;
<br>For I am not so with myself.
<br>
<br>My soul is weary of my life;
<br>I will give free course to my complaint;
<br>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
<br>2I will say unto God: Do not condemn me;
<br>Make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me.
<br>3Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress,
<br>That Thou shouldest despise the work of Thy hands,
<br>And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
<br>4Hast Thou eyes of flesh? Or seest Thou as man seeth?
<br>5Are Thy days as the days of man, Or Thy years as a man’s days, 6That Thou inquirest after mine
<br>iniquity,
<br>And searchest after my sin,
<br> 
<br>7Although Thou knowest that I shall not be condemned;
<br>And there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand?
<br>8Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me
<br>Together round about; yet Thou dost destroy me!
<br>9Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast fashioned me as clay;
<br>And wilt Thou bring me into dust again?
<br>10Hast Thou not poured me out as milk,
<br>And curdled me like cheese?
<br>11Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
<br>And knit me together with bones and sinews.
<br>12Thou hast granted me life and favour,
<br>And Thy providence hath preserved my spirit.
<br>13Yet these things Thou didst hide in Thy heart;
<br>I know that this is with Thee;
<br>14If I sin, then Thou markest me,
<br>And Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
<br> 
<br>17Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me,
<br>And increasest Thine indignation upon me;
<br>Host succeeding host against me.
<br>
<br>18Wherefore then hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb?
<br>Would that I had perished, and no eye had seen me!
<br>19I should have been as though I had not been;
<br>I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
<br>20Are not my days few? Cease then,
<br>And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
<br>21Before I go whence I shall not return,
<br>Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
<br>22A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself;
<br>A land of the shadow of death, without any order,
<br>And where the light is as darkness.
<br>
<br>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:
<br> 
<br>15If I be wicked, woe unto me;
<br>And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head—
<br>Being filled with ignominy
<br>And looking upon mine affliction.
<br>16And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest me as a lion;
<br>And again Thou showest Thyself marvellous upon me.
<br> 
<br>2Should not the multitude of words be answered?
<br>And should a man full of talk be accounted right?
<br>3Thy boastings have made men hold their peace,
<br>And thou hast mocked, with none to make thee ashamed;
<br>4And thou hast said: ‘My doctrine is pure,
<br> 
<br>And I am clean in Thine eyes.’ 5But oh that God would speak, And open His lips against thee; 6And that He would tell thee the
<br>secrets of wisdom,
<br>That sound wisdom is manifold!
<br>Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
<br>
<br>7Canst thou find out the deep things of God?
<br>Canst thou attain unto the purpose of the Almighty?
<br>8It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?
<br>Deeper than the nether-world; what canst thou know?
<br>9The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
<br>And broader than the sea.
<br>10If He pass by, and shut up,
<br>Or gather in, then who can hinder Him?
<br>11For He knoweth base men;
<br>And when He seeth iniquity, will He not then consider it?
<br>12But an empty man will get understanding,
<br>When a wild ass’s colt is born a man.
<br>
<br>13If thou set thy heart aright,
<br>And stretch out thy hands toward Him—
<br>14If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away,
<br>And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents—
<br> 
<br>15Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
<br>Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear;
<br>16For thou shalt forget thy misery;
<br>Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away;
<br>17And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday;
<br>Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
<br>18And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
<br>Yea, thou shalt look about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.
<br>19Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
<br>Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
<br>20But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
<br>And they shall have no way to flee,
<br>And their hope shall be the drooping of the soul.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2No doubt but ye are the people,
<br>And wisdom shall die with you.
<br>3But I have understanding as well as you;
<br>I am not inferior to you;
<br>Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
<br>4I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour,
<br>A man that called upon God, And He answered him;
<br> 
<br>The just, the innocent man is a laughing-stock,
<br>5A contemptible brand in the thought of him that is at ease,
<br>A thing ready for them whose foot slippeth.
<br>6The tents of robbers prosper,
<br>And they that provoke God are secure,
<br>In whatsoever God bringeth into their hand.
<br>
<br>7But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
<br>And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee;
<br>8Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;
<br>And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee;
<br>9Who knoweth not among all these,
<br>That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
<br>10In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
<br>And the breath of all mankind.—
<br>11Doth not the ear try words,
<br>Even as the palate tasteth its food?
<br>12Is wisdom with aged men,
<br>And understanding in length of days?—
<br>13With Him is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding. 14Behold, He breaketh down, and it
<br>cannot be built again;
<br>He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
<br>15Behold, He withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;
<br> 
<br>Also He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
<br>16With Him is strength and sound wisdom;
<br>The deceived and the deceiver are His.
<br>17He leadeth counsellors away stripped,
<br>And judges maketh He fools.
<br>18He looseth the bond of kings,
<br>And bindeth their loins with a girdle.
<br>19He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty.
<br>20He removeth the speech of men of trust,
<br>And taketh away the sense of the elders.
<br>21He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong.
<br>22He uncovereth deep things out of darkness,
<br>And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
<br>23He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them;
<br>He enlargeth the nations, and leadeth them away.
<br>24He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the land,
<br>And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
<br>25They grope in the dark without light,
<br>And He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
<br>
<br>Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and
<br> 
<br>understood it.
<br>2What ye know, do I know also; I am not inferior unto you.
<br>3Notwithstanding I would speak to the Almighty,
<br>And I desire to reason with God.
<br>4But ye are plasterers of lies,
<br>Ye are all physicians of no value.
<br>5Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!
<br>And it would be your wisdom.
<br>6Hear now my reasoning,
<br>And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
<br>7Will ye speak unrighteously for God,
<br>And talk deceitfully for Him? 8Will ye show Him favour? Will ye contend for God?
<br>9Would it be good that He should search you out?
<br>Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him?
<br>10He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show favour.
<br>11Shall not His majesty terrify you, And His dread fall upon you?
<br>12Your memorials shall be like unto ashes,
<br>Your eminences to eminences of clay.
<br>
<br>13Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak,
<br>And let come on me what will.
<br>14Wherefore? I will take my flesh in my teeth,
<br>And put my life in my hand.
<br> 
<br>15Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him;
<br>But I will argue my ways before Him.
<br>16This also shall be my salvation, That a hypocrite cannot come before
<br>Him.
<br>17Hear diligently my speech,
<br>And let my declaration be in your ears.
<br>18Behold now, I have ordered my cause;
<br>I know that I shall be justified.
<br>19Who is he that will contend with me?
<br>For then would I hold my peace and die.
<br>
<br>20Only do not two things unto me, Then will I not hide myself from
<br>Thee:
<br>21Withdraw Thy hand far from me;
<br>And let not Thy terror make me afraid.
<br>22Then call Thou, and I will answer;
<br>Or let me speak, and answer Thou me.
<br>23How many are mine iniquities and sins?
<br>Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
<br>24Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, And holdest me for Thine enemy? 25Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf?
<br>And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble?
<br>26That Thou shouldest write bitter things against me,
<br> 
<br>And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
<br>27Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,
<br>And lookest narrowly unto all my paths;
<br>Thou drawest Thee a line about the soles of my feet;
<br>28Though I am like a wine-skin that consumeth,
<br>Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
<br>
<br>Man that is born of a woman Is of few days, and full of
<br>trouble.
<br>2He cometh forth like a flower, and withereth;
<br>He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
<br>3And dost Thou open Thine eyes upon such a one,
<br>And bringest me into judgment with Thee?
<br>4Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
<br>5Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with
<br>Thee,
<br>And Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
<br>6Look away from him, that he may rest,
<br>Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
<br>
<br>7For there is hope of a tree,
<br>If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
<br> 
<br>And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
<br>8Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
<br>And the stock thereof die in the ground;
<br>9Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
<br>And put forth boughs like a plant.
<br>10But man dieth, and lieth low;
<br>Yea, man perisheth, and where is he?
<br>11As the waters fail from the sea, And the river is drained dry;
<br>12So man lieth down and riseth not;
<br>Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
<br>Nor be roused out of their sleep.
<br>13Oh that Thou wouldest hide me in the nether-world,
<br>That Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past,
<br>That Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!—
<br>14If a man die, may he live again?
<br>All the days of my service would I wait, till my relief should come—
<br>15Thou wouldest call, and I would answer Thee;
<br>Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of Thy hands.
<br>16But now Thou numberest my steps,
<br>Thou dost not even wait for my sin;
<br>17My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
<br>And Thou heapest up mine iniquity.
<br>18And surely the mountain falling crumbleth away,
<br> 
<br>And the rock is removed out of its place;
<br>19The waters wear the stones;
<br>The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth;
<br>So Thou destroyest the hope of man.
<br>20Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;
<br>Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
<br>21His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
<br>And they are brought low, but he regardeth them not.
<br>22But his flesh grieveth for him, And his soul mourneth over him.
<br>
<br>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:
<br> 
<br>7Art thou the first man that was born?
<br>Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
<br>8Dost thou hearken in the council of God?
<br>And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
<br>9What knowest thou, that we know not?
<br>What understandest thou, which is not in us?
<br>10With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,
<br>Much older than thy father.
<br>11Are the consolations of God too small for thee,
<br>And the word that dealeth gently with thee?
<br> 
<br>2Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge,
<br>And fill his belly with the east wind?
<br>3Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
<br>Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
<br>4Yea, thou doest away with fear, And impairest devotion before God. 5For thine iniquity teacheth thy
<br>mouth,
<br>And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
<br>6Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;
<br>Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
<br> 
<br>12Why doth thy heart carry thee away?
<br>And why do thine eyes wink?
<br>13That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
<br>And lettest such words go out of thy mouth.
<br>14What is man, that he should be clean?
<br>And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
<br>15Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones;
<br>Yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight.
<br>16How much less one that is abominable and impure,
<br>Man who drinketh iniquity like water!
<br> 
<br>17I will tell thee, hear thou me;
<br>And that which I have seen I will declare—
<br>18Which wise men have told
<br>From their fathers, and have not hid it;
<br>19Unto whom alone the land was given,
<br>And no stranger passed among them.
<br>20The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
<br>Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
<br>21A sound of terrors is in his ears:
<br>In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
<br>22He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
<br>And he is waited for of the sword.
<br>23He wandereth abroad for bread: ‘Where is it?’
<br>He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
<br>24Distress and anguish overwhelm him;
<br>They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
<br>25Because he hath stretched out his hand against God,
<br>And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;
<br>26He runneth upon him with a stiff neck,
<br>With the thick bosses of his bucklers.
<br>27Because he hath covered his face with his fatness,
<br> 
<br>And made collops of fat on his loins;
<br>28And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,
<br>In houses which no man would inhabit,
<br>Which were ready to become heaps.
<br>29He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
<br>Neither shall their produce bend to the earth.
<br>30He shall not depart out of darkness;
<br>The flame shall dry up his branches,
<br>And by the breath of His mouth shall he go away.
<br>31Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;
<br>For vanity shall be his recompense.
<br>32It shall be accomplished before his time,
<br>And his branch shall not be leafy.
<br>33He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
<br>And shall cast off his flower as the olive.
<br>34For the company of the godless shall be desolate,
<br>And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
<br>35They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity,
<br>And their belly prepareth deceit.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2I have heard many such things;
<br>Sorry comforters are ye all.
<br>3Shall windy words have an end?
<br> 
<br>Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
<br>4I also could speak as ye do;
<br>If your soul were in my soul’s stead,
<br>I could join words together against you,
<br>And shake my head at you.
<br>5I would strengthen you with my mouth,
<br>And the moving of my lips would assuage your grief.
<br>
<br>6Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged;
<br>And though I forbear, what am I eased?
<br>7But now He hath made me weary;
<br>Thou hast made desolate all my company.
<br>8And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me;
<br>And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.
<br>9He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me;
<br>He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth;
<br>Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
<br>10They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
<br>They have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully;
<br>They gather themselves together against me.
<br>11God delivereth me to the ungodly,
<br>And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
<br> 
<br>12I was at ease, and He broke me asunder;
<br>Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces;
<br>He hath also set me up for His mark.
<br>13His archers compass me round about,
<br>He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
<br>He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
<br>14He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
<br>He runneth upon me like a giant.
<br>15I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
<br>And have laid my horn in the dust.
<br>16My face is reddened with weeping,
<br>And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
<br>17Although there is no violence in my hands,
<br>And my prayer is pure.
<br>18O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-
<br>place.
<br>19Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,
<br>And He that testifieth of me is on high.
<br>20Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors,
<br>Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;
<br>21That He would set aright a man contending with God,
<br>As a son of man setteth aright his neighbour!
<br> 
<br>22For the years that are few are coming on,
<br>And I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
<br>My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,
<br>The grave is ready for me.
<br>2Surely there are mockers with me,
<br>And mine eye abideth in their provocation.
<br>3Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself;
<br>Who else is there that will strike hands with me?
<br>4For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding;
<br>Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them.
<br>5He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery,
<br>Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
<br>
<br>6He hath made me also a byword of the people;
<br>And I am become one in whose face they spit.
<br> 
<br>And I shall not find a wise man among you.
<br>11My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
<br>Even the thoughts of my heart.
<br>12They change the night into day;
<br>The light is short because of darkness.
<br>13If I look for the nether-world as my house;
<br>If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
<br>14If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou art my father’,
<br>To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, and my sister’;
<br>15Where then is my hope?
<br>And as for my hope, who shall see it?
<br>16They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world,
<br>When we are at rest together in the dust.
<br>
<br>Then	answered	Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
<br> 
<br>7Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation,
<br>And all my members are as a shadow.
<br>8Upright men are astonished at this,
<br>And the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless.
<br>9Yet the righteous holdeth on his way,
<br>And he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger.
<br>10But as for you all, do ye return, and come now;
<br> 
<br>2How long will ye lay snares for words?
<br>Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
<br>3Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
<br>And reputed dull in your sight?
<br>4Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger,
<br>Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
<br>Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
<br> 
<br>5Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
<br>And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
<br>6The light shall be dark in his tent,
<br>And his lamp over him shall be put out.
<br>7The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
<br>And his own counsel shall cast him down.
<br>8For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
<br>And he walketh upon the toils.
<br>9A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him. 10A noose is hid for him in the
<br>ground,
<br>And a trap for him in the way.
<br>11Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side,
<br>And shall entrap him at his feet.
<br>12His trouble shall be ravenous,
<br>And calamity shall be ready for his fall.
<br>13It shall devour the members of his body,
<br>Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.
<br>14That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent;
<br>And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
<br>15There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his;
<br>Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
<br>16His roots shall dry up beneath, And above shall his branch wither.
<br> 
<br>17His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
<br>And he shall have no name abroad.
<br>18He shall be driven from light into darkness,
<br>And chased out of the world.
<br>19He shall have neither son nor son’s son among his people,
<br>Nor any remaining in his dwellings.
<br>20They that come after shall be astonished at his day,
<br>As they that went before are affrighted.
<br>21Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
<br>And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2How long will ye vex my soul,
<br>And crush me with words?
<br>3These ten times have ye reproached me;
<br>Ye are not ashamed that ye deal harshly with me.
<br>4And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself. 5If indeed ye will magnify
<br>yourselves against me,
<br>And plead against me my reproach;
<br>6Know now that God hath subverted my cause,
<br>And hath compassed me with His net.
<br>7Behold, I cry out: ‘Violence! ’ but I am not heard;
<br>I cry aloud, but there is no justice.
<br> 
<br>8He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
<br>And hath set darkness in my paths. 9He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head. 10He hath broken me down on every
<br>side, and I am gone;
<br>And my hope hath He plucked up like a tree.
<br>11He hath also kindled His wrath against me,
<br>And He counteth me unto Him as one of His adversaries.
<br>12His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent. 13He hath put my brethren far from
<br>me,
<br>And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
<br>14My kinsfolk have failed,
<br>And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
<br>15They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger;
<br>I am become an alien in their sight.
<br>16I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer,
<br>Though I entreat him with my mouth.
<br>17My breath is abhorred of my wife,
<br>And I am loathsome to the children of my tribe.
<br>18Even urchins despised me;
<br>If I arise, they speak against me.
<br>19All my intimate friends abhor me;
<br>And they whom I loved are turned against me.
<br> 
<br>20My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
<br>And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
<br>
<br>21Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
<br>For the hand of God hath touched me.
<br>22Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh? 23Oh that my words were now
<br>written!
<br>Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
<br>24That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for
<br>ever!
<br>25But as for me, I know that my Redeemer liveth,
<br>And that He will witness at the last upon the dust;
<br>26And when after my skin this is destroyed,
<br>Then without my flesh shall I see God;
<br>27Whom I, even I, shall see for myself,
<br>And mine eyes shall behold, and not another’s.
<br>My reins are consumed within me.
<br>28If ye say: ‘How we will persecute him! ’
<br>Seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;
<br>29Be ye afraid of the sword;
<br>For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,
<br> 
<br>That ye may know there is a judgment.
<br>
<br>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:
<br>2Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,
<br>Even by reason of mine agitation that is in me.
<br>3I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame,
<br>But out of my understanding my spirit answereth me.
<br>
<br>4Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth, 5That the triumphing of the wicked
<br>is short,
<br>And the joy of the godless but for a moment?
<br>6Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
<br>And his head reach unto the clouds;
<br>7Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung;
<br>They that have seen him shall say: ‘Where is he?’
<br>8He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found;
<br>Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
<br>9The eye which saw him shall see him no more;
<br>Neither shall his place any more behold him.
<br>10His children shall appease the poor,
<br>And his hands shall restore his wealth.
<br> 
<br>11His bones are full of his youth,
<br>But it shall lie down with him in the dust.
<br>12Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
<br>Though he hide it under his tongue;
<br>13Though he spare it, and will not let it go,
<br>But keep it still within his mouth;
<br>14Yet his food in his bowels is turned,
<br>It is the gall of asps within him.
<br>15He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again;
<br>God shall cast them out of his belly. 16He shall suck the poison of asps; The viper’s tongue shall slay him. 17He shall not look upon the rivers,
<br>The flowing streams of honey and curd.
<br>18That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down;
<br>According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
<br>19For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;
<br>He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
<br>20Because he knew no quietness within him,
<br>In his greed he suffered nought to escape,
<br>21There was nothing left that he devoured not—
<br>Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
<br> 
<br>22In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits;
<br>The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. 23It shall be for the filling of his
<br>belly;
<br>He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him,
<br>And shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh.
<br>24If he flee from the iron weapon,
<br>The bow of brass shall strike him through.
<br>25He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body;
<br>Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall;
<br>Terrors are upon him.
<br>26All darkness is laid up for his treasures;
<br>A fire not blown by man shall consume him;
<br>It shall go ill with him that is left in his tent.
<br>27The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,
<br>And the earth shall rise up against him.
<br>28The increase of his house shall depart,
<br>His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
<br>29This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
<br>And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2Hear diligently my speech;
<br> 
<br>And let this be your consolations.
<br>3Suffer me, that I may speak;
<br>And after that I have spoken, mock on.
<br>4As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?
<br>5Turn unto me, and be astonished,
<br>And lay your hand upon your mouth.
<br>6Even when I remember I am affrighted,
<br>And horror hath taketh hold on my flesh.
<br>7Wherefore do the wicked live,
<br>Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
<br>8Their seed is established in their sight with them,
<br>And their offspring before their eyes.
<br>9Their houses are safe, without fear,
<br>Neither is the rod of God upon them.
<br>10Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
<br>Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
<br>11They send forth their little ones like a flock,
<br>And their children dance.
<br>12They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 13They spend their days in
<br>prosperity,
<br>And peacefully they go down to the grave.
<br>14Yet they said unto God: ‘Depart from us;
<br> 
<br>For we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.
<br>15What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?
<br>And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’—
<br>16Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand;
<br>The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<br>
<br>17How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
<br>That their calamity cometh upon them?
<br>That He distributeth pains in His anger?
<br>18That they are as stubble before the wind,
<br>And as chaff that the storm stealeth away?
<br>19’God layeth up his iniquity for his children! ’—
<br>Let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.
<br>20Let his own eyes see his destruction,
<br>And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
<br>21For what pleasure hath he in his house after him?
<br>Seeing the number of his months is determined.
<br>
<br>22Shall any teach God knowledge?
<br>Seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high.
<br>23One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet;
<br> 
<br>24His pails are full of milk,
<br>And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
<br>25And another dieth in bitterness of soul,
<br>And hath never tasted of good. 26They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.
<br>
<br>27Behold, I know your thoughts,
<br>And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
<br>28For ye say: ‘Where is the house of the prince?
<br>And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?’
<br>29Have ye not asked them that go by the way;
<br>And will ye misdeem their tokens,
<br>30That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,
<br>That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
<br>31But who shall declare his way to his face?
<br>And who shall repay him what he hath done?
<br>32For he is borne to the grave, And watch is kept over his tomb. 33The clods of the valley are sweet
<br>unto him,
<br>And all men draw after him,
<br>As there were innumerable before him.
<br>34How then comfort ye me in vain?
<br>And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness?
<br> 
<br>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:
<br>2Can a man be profitable unto God?
<br>Or can he that is wise be profitable unto Him?
<br>3Is it any advantage to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
<br>Or is it gain to Him, that thou makest thy ways blameless?
<br>4Is it for thy fear of Him that He reproveth thee,
<br>That He entereth with thee into judgment?
<br>5Is not thy wickedness great?
<br>And are not thine iniquities without end?
<br>6For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,
<br>And stripped the naked of their clothing.
<br>7Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
<br>And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
<br>8And as a mighty man, who hath the earth,
<br>And as a man of rank, who dwelleth in it,
<br>9Thou hast sent widows away empty,
<br>And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
<br>10Therefore snares are round about thee,
<br>And sudden dread affrighted thee,
<br>11Or darkness, that thou canst not see,
<br>And abundance of waters cover thee.
<br> 
<br>12Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the topmost of the stars,
<br>how high they are!
<br>13And thou sayest: ‘What doth God know?
<br>Can He judge through the dark cloud?
<br>14Thick clouds are a covering to Him, that He seeth not;
<br>And He walketh in the circuit of heaven.’
<br>15Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden? 16Who were snatched away before
<br>their time,
<br>Whose foundation was poured out as a stream;
<br>17Who said unto God: ‘Depart from us’;
<br>And what could the Almighty do unto them?
<br>18Yet He filled their houses with good things—
<br>But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<br>19The righteous saw it, and were glad,
<br>And the innocent laugh them to scorn:
<br>20’Surely their substance is cut off,
<br>And their abundance the fire hath consumed.’
<br>
<br>21Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace;
<br>Thereby shall thine increase be good.
<br>22Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth,
<br> 
<br>And lay up His words in thy heart.
<br>23If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up—
<br>If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents,
<br>24And lay thy treasure in the dust,
<br>And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
<br>25And the Almighty be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee; 26Then surely shalt thou have thy
<br>delight in the Almighty,
<br>And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
<br>27Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee,
<br>And thou shalt pay thy vows;
<br>28Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, And light shall shine upon thy ways.
<br>
<br>29When they cast thee down, thou shalt say: ‘There is lifting up’;
<br>For the humble person He saveth.
<br>30He delivereth him that is innocent,
<br>Yea, thou shalt be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2Even to-day is my complaint bitter;
<br>My hand is become heavy because of my groaning.
<br>3Oh that I knew where I might find Him,
<br>That I might come even to His seat!
<br>4I would order my cause before Him,
<br>And fill my mouth with arguments.
<br> 
<br>5I would know the words which He would answer me,
<br>And understand what He would say unto me.
<br>6Would He contend with me in His great power?
<br>Nay; but He would give heed unto me.
<br>7There the upright might reason with Him;
<br>So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge.
<br>
<br>8Behold, I go forward, but He is not there,
<br>And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
<br>9On the left hand, when He doth work, but I cannot behold Him,
<br>He turneth Himself to the right hand, but I cannot see Him.
<br>
<br>10For He knoweth the way that I take;
<br>When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
<br>11My foot hath held fast to His steps,
<br>His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
<br>12I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips;
<br>I have treasured up the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
<br>
<br>13But He is at one with Himself, and who can turn Him?
<br>And what His soul desireth, even that He doeth.
<br> 
<br>14For He will perform that which is appointed for me;
<br>And many such things are with Him.
<br>15Therefore am I affrighted at His presence;
<br>When I consider, I am afraid of Him.
<br>16Yea, God hath made my heart faint,
<br>And the Almighty hath affrighted me;
<br>17Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
<br>Neither did He cover the thick darkness from my face.
<br>
<br>Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?
<br>And why do not they that know Him see His days?
<br>2There are that remove the landmarks;
<br>They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
<br>3They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
<br>They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
<br>4They turn the needy out of the way;
<br>The poor of the earth hide themselves together.
<br>5Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness
<br>They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;
<br>The desert yieldeth them bread for their children.
<br>6They cut his provender in the field;
<br> 
<br>And they despoil the vineyard of the wicked.
<br>7They lie all night naked without clothing,
<br>And have no covering in the cold.
<br>8They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
<br>And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
<br>9There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,
<br>And take a pledge of the poor;
<br>10So that they go about naked without clothing,
<br>And being hungry they carry the sheaves;
<br>11They make oil within the rows of these men;
<br>They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
<br>12From out of the populous city men groan,
<br>And the soul of the wounded crieth out;
<br>Yet God imputeth it not for unseemliness.
<br>
<br>13These are of them that rebel against the light;
<br>They know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
<br>14The murderer riseth with the light, to kill the poor and needy;
<br>And in the night he is as a thief.
<br>15The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
<br>Saying: ‘No eye shall see me’;
<br>And he putteth a covering on his face.
<br> 
<br>16In the dark they dig through houses;
<br>They shut themselves up in the day- time;
<br>They know not the light.
<br>17For the shadow of death is to all of them as the morning;
<br>For they know the terrors of the shadow of death.
<br>
<br>18He is swift upon the face of the waters;
<br>Their portion is cursed in the earth;
<br>He turneth not by the way of the vineyards.
<br>19Drought and heat consume the snow waters;
<br>So doth the nether-world those that have sinned.
<br>20The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him;
<br>He shall be no more remembered;
<br>And unrighteousness is broken as a tree.
<br>21He devoureth the barren that beareth not;
<br>And doeth not good to the widow.
