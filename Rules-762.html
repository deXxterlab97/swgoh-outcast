<br>(1) Required finding
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (c) has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries; and
<br>
<br>(E) such allocation will not create, for the person who owns and would otherwise use such natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such person to be unable to satisfy such person's natural gas requirements for high-priority uses.
<br>(2) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas which would be certificated natural gas but for the second sentence of section 3301(19) of this title.
<br>(3) Consideration of economic feasibility of alternative fuels
<br>
<br>In issuing any order under this subsection, the President shall consider the economic feasibility of alternative fuels available to the user which owned the natural gas subject to an order under this subsection.
<br>(e) Limitation
<br>
<br>No order may be issued under this section unless the President determines that such order will not require transportation of natural gas by any pipeline in excess of its available transportation capacity.
<br>(f) Industry assistance
<br>
<br>The President may request that representatives of pipelines, local distribution companies, and other persons meet and provide assistance to the President in carrying out his authority under this section.
<br>(g) Compensation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the parties to any order issued under subsection (b), (c), (d), or (h) fail to agree upon the terms of compensation for natural gas deliveries or transportation required pursuant to such order, the President, after a hearing held either before or after such order takes effect, shall, by supplemental order, prescribe the amount of compensation to be paid for such deliveries or transportation and for any other expenses incurred in delivering or transporting natural gas.
<br>(2) Calculation of compensation for certain boiler fuel natural gas
<br>
<br>For purposes of any supplemental order under paragraph (1) with respect to emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (b), the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
<br>
<br>(A) for supplies of natural gas based upon the amount required to make whole the user subject to the prohibition order, but in no event may such compensation exceed just compensation prescribed in section 717z of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President.
<br>(3) Compensation for other natural gas allocated
<br>
<br>For the purpose of any supplemental order under paragraph (1), if the party making emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (c) or (d)—
<br>
<br>(A) indicates a preference for compensation in kind, the President shall direct that compensation in kind be provided as expeditiously as practicable;
<br>
<br>(B) indicates a preference for compensation, or the President determines that, notwithstanding paragraph (A) of this subsection, any portion thereof cannot practicably be compensated in kind, the President shall calculate the amount of compensation—
<br>
<br>(i) for supplies of natural gas, based upon the amount required to make the pipeline and its local distribution companies whole, in the case of any order under subsection (c), or to make the user from whom natural gas is allocated whole, in the case of any order under subsection (d) including any amount actually paid by such pipeline and its local distribution companies or such user for volumes of natural gas or higher cost synthetic gas acquired to replace natural gas subject to an order under subsection (c) or (d); and
<br>
<br>(ii) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President. Compensation received by an interstate pipeline under this subsection shall be credited to the account of any local distribution company served by that pipeline to the extent ordered by the President to make such local distribution company whole.
<br>(h) Related transportation and facilities
<br>
<br>The President may, by order, require any pipeline to transport natural gas, and to construct and operate such facilities for the transportation of natural gas, as he determines necessary to carry out any order under subsection (b), (c), or (d). Compensation for the costs of any construction or transportation ordered under this subsection shall be determined under subsection (g) and shall be paid by the person to whom supplies of natural gas are ordered allocated under this section.
<br>(i) Monitoring
<br>
<br>In order to effect the purposes of this part, the President shall monitor the operation of any order made pursuant to this section to assure that natural gas delivered pursuant to this section is applied to high-priority uses only.
<br>(j) Commission study
<br>
<br>Not later than June 1, 1979, the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report regarding whether authority to allocate natural gas, which is not otherwise subject to allocation under this part, is likely to be necessary to meet high-priority uses.
<br>(k) "High-priority use" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "high-priority use" means any—
<br>
<br>(1) use of natural gas in a residence;
<br>
<br>(2) use of natural gas in a commercial establishment in amounts less than 50 Mcf on a peak day; or
<br>
<br>(3) any use of natural gas the curtailment of which the President determines would endanger life, health, or maintenance of physical property.

<br>(i) any intrastate pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any local distribution company.
<br>(B) Just and reasonable rates
<br>
<br>The rates and charges of any interstate pipeline with respect to any transportation authorized under subparagraph (A) shall be just and reasonable (within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.]).
<br>(2) Intrastate pipelines
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may, by rule or order, authorize any intrastate pipeline to transport natural gas on behalf of—

<br>(i) Maximum fair and equitable price
<br>
<br>The rates and charges of any intrastate pipeline with respect to any transportation authorized under subparagraph (A), including any amount computed in accordance with the rule prescribed under clause (ii), shall be fair and equitable and may not exceed an amount which is reasonably comparable to the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.
<br>(ii) Commission rule
<br>
<br>The Commission shall, by rule, establish the method for calculating an amount necessary to—
<br>
<br>(I) reasonably compensate any intrastate pipeline for expenses incurred by the pipeline and associated with the providing of any gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery, or similar service provided by such pipeline in connection with any transportation of natural gas authorized under subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(II) provide an opportunity for such pipeline to earn a reasonable profit on such services.
<br>(b) Commission approval of sales
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may, by rule or order, authorize any intrastate pipeline to sell natural gas to—
<br>
<br>(A) any interstate pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(B) any local distribution company served by any interstate pipeline.
<br>(2) Rates and charges
<br>(A) Maximum fair and equitable price
<br>
<br>The rates and charges of any intrastate pipeline with respect to any sale of natural gas authorized under paragraph (1) shall be fair and equitable and may not exceed the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) such intrastate pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount, computed in accordance with the rule prescribed under subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(iii) any adjustment permitted under subparagraph (C).
<br>(B) Commission rule
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) provide an opportunity for such pipeline to earn a reasonable profit on such services.
<br>(C) Adjustment
<br>(i) Application
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall apply in any case in which, in order to deliver any volume of natural gas pursuant to any sale authorized under paragraph (1), any intrastate pipeline acquires quantities of natural gas under any existing contract, if—
<br>
<br>(I) such intrastate pipeline acquires any volume of natural gas under such contract in excess of that which such pipeline would otherwise have acquired; and
<br>
<br>(II) the price paid for such additional volume of natural gas acquired under such contract is greater than such pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas, computed without regard to the acquisition of such additional volume of natural gas.
<br>(ii) Commission adjustment
<br>
<br>In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the Commission shall permit an adjustment to the maximum fair and equitable price provided under subparagraph (A) to increase the revenue to the intrastate pipeline under such sale by an amount determined by the Commission to be adequate to offset the additional cost incurred by such pipeline due to any increase in such pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas.
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>(A) Two-year duration
<br>
<br>No authorization of any sale (or any extension thereof) under paragraph (1) may be for a period exceeding two years.
<br>(B) Extension

<br>Any authorization of any sale under paragraph (1), and any extension of any such authorization under this subparagraph, may be extended by the Commission if such extension satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
<br>(4) Adequacy of service to intrastate customers
<br>
<br>Any sale authorized under paragraph (1) shall be subject to interruption to the extent that natural gas subject to such sale is required to enable the intrastate pipeline involved to provide adequate service to such pipeline's customers at the time of such sale.
<br>(5) Procedural requirements
<br>(A) Affidavit
<br>
<br>Any application for authorization of any sale under paragraph (1) shall be accompanied by an affidavit filed by the intrastate pipeline involved and setting forth—

<br>(iv) the price or prices of such volumes; and
<br>
<br>(v) such other information as the Commission may, by rule, require.
<br>(B) Verification of compliance
<br>

<br>(6) Termination of sales
<br>(A) Hearing
<br>
<br>Upon complaint of any interested person, or upon the Commission's own motion, the Commission shall, after affording an opportunity for oral presentation of views and arguments, terminate any sale authorized under paragraph (1) if the Commission determines—

<br>(i) such termination is required to enable the intrastate pipeline involved to provide adequate service to the customers of such pipeline at the time of such sale;
<br>
<br>(ii) such sale involves the sale of natural gas acquired by the intrastate pipeline involved solely or primarily for the purpose of resale of such natural gas pursuant to a sale authorized under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(iii) such sale violates any requirement of this subsection or any term or condition established, by rule or order, by the Commission and applicable to such sale; or
<br>
<br>(iv) such sale circumvents or violates any provision of this chapter.

<br>(C) Determination
<br>
<br>The determination of whether any interruption of any sale authorized under paragraph (1) is required under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be made by the Commission without regard to the character of the use of natural gas by any customer of the intrastate pipeline involved.
<br>(D) State intervention
<br>
<br>Any interested State may intervene as a matter of right in any proceeding before the Commission relating to any determination under this section.
<br>(7) Disapproval of application
<br>
<br>The Commission shall disapprove any application for authorization of any sale under paragraph (1) if the Commission determines—

<br>
<br>(B) such sale would involve the sale of natural gas acquired by the intrastate pipeline involved solely or primarily for the purpose of resale of such natural gas pursuant to a sale authorized under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(C) such sale would violate any requirement of this subsection or any term or condition established, by rule or order, by the Commission and applicable to such sale; or

<br>Any person who is a party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by any final order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit in which the party to which such order relates is located or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Review shall be obtained by filing a written petition, requesting that such order be modified or set aside in whole or in part, in such Court of Appeals within 60 days after the final action of the Commission on the application for rehearing required under paragraph (2). A copy of such petition shall forthwith be transmitted by the clerk of such court to any member of the Commission and thereupon the Commission shall file with the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order in whole or in part. No objection to such order of the Commission shall be considered by the court if such objection was not urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there was reasonable ground for the failure to do so. The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceedings before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. The Commission shall also file with the court its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Commission, shall be final subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
<br>(5) Orders remain effective
<br>
<br>The filing of an application for rehearing under paragraph (2) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the Commission, operate as a stay of the Commission's order. The commencement of proceedings under paragraph (4) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission's order.
<br>(b) Review of rules and orders
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsections (a) and (c), judicial review of any rule or order, within the meaning of section 551(4) of title 5, issued under this chapter may be obtained in the United States Court of Appeals for any appropriate circuit pursuant to the provisions of chapter 7 of title 5, except that the second sentence of section 705 thereof shall not apply.
<br>(c) Judicial review of emergency orders
<br>
<br>Except with respect to enforcement of orders or subpenas under section 3364(a) of this title, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to review all civil cases and controversies under section 3361, 3362 or 3363 of this title, including any order issued, or other action taken, under such section. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all appeals from the district courts of the United States in cases and controversies arising under section 3364(a)(2) of this title; such appeals shall be taken by the filing of a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within thirty days after the entry of judgment by the district court. Prior to a final judgment, no court shall have jurisdiction to grant any injunctive relief to stay or defer the implementation of any order issued, or action taken, under section 3361, 3362, or 3363 of this title.

<br>§3601. Congressional findings and purpose
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) there is a shortage of adequate and affordable housing throughout the Nation, especially for low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons;
<br>
<br>(2) the number of conversions of rental housing to condominiums and cooperatives is accelerating, which in some communities may restrict the shelter options of low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons;
<br>
<br>(3) certain long-term leasing arrangements for recreation and other condominium- or cooperative-related facilities which have been used in the formation of cooperative and condominium projects may be unconscionable; in certain situations State governments are unable to provide appropriate relief; as a result of these leases, economic and social hardships may have been imposed upon cooperative and condominium owners, which may threaten the continued use and acceptability of these forms of ownership and interfere with the interstate sale of cooperatives and condominiums; appropriate relief from these abuses requires Federal action; and
<br>
<br>(4) there is a Federal involvement with the cooperative and condominium housing markets through the operation of Federal tax, housing, and community development laws, through the operation of federally chartered and insured financial institutions, and through other Federal activities; that the creation of many condominiums and cooperatives is undertaken by entities operating on an interstate basis.
<br>
<br>(b) The purposes of this chapter are to seek to minimize the adverse impacts of condominium and cooperative conversions particularly on the housing opportunities of low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons, to assure fair and equitable principles are followed in the establishment of condominium and cooperative opportunities, and to provide appropriate relief where long-term leases of recreation and other cooperative- and condominium-related facilities are determined to be unconscionable.

<br>§3605. Notice of conversion and opportunity to purchase; responsibility of State and local governments
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that, when multifamily rental housing projects are converted to condominium or cooperative use, tenants in those projects are entitled to adequate notice of the pending conversion and to receive the first opportunity to purchase units in the converted projects and that State and local governments which have not already provided for such notice and opportunity for purchase should move toward that end. The Congress believes it is the responsibility of State and local governments to provide for such notice and opportunity to purchase in a prompt manner. The Congress has decided not to intervene and therefore leaves this responsibility to State and local governments to be carried out.
