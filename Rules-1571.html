<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1), the words "Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts" are substituted for "shall . . . be covered into the Treasury" in 31:369 because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words "amounts the Secretary receives from the operations of the Bureau of the Mint" are substituted for "The money arising from all charges and deductions on and from gold and silver bullion and from all other sources" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "amounts from" are substituted for "money arising from the manufacture and sale of" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "numismatic items" are substituted for "medals, proof coins, and uncirculated coins" for consistency with section 5111(a)(3) of the revised title. The words "minting coins" are substituted for "silver or minor coinage" for consistency with section 5112 of the revised title. The words "made by law" are omitted as surplus. The words "on estimates furnished by the Secretary of the Treasury" are omitted because of section 1108 of the revised title. The text of 31:273(1st, 2d sentences) is omitted because of section 321 of the revised title and the other source provisions restated in this chapter.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(2), the words "ending September 30" are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title.

<br>This is necessary because the language was restated by section 382(h)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97–35, 95 Stat. 432) but inadvertently codified as 31:5132(a)(1) (last sentence) by section 1 of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Pub. L. 97–258, 96 Stat. 989.)

<br>
<br>A State or a territory or possession of the United States may tax United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) as money on hand or on deposit in the same way and at the same rate that the State, territory, or possession taxes other forms of money.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—CREDIT AND MONETARY EXPANSION
<br>§5301. Buying obligations of the United States Government
<br>
<br>(a) The President may direct the Secretary of the Treasury to make an agreement with the Federal reserve banks and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System when the President decides that the foreign commerce of the United States is affected adversely because—
<br>
<br>(1) the value of coins and currency of a foreign country compared to the present standard value of gold is depreciating;
<br>
<br>(2) action is necessary to regulate and maintain the parity of United States coins and currency;
<br>
<br>(3) an economic emergency requires an expansion of credit; or
<br>
<br>(4) an expansion of credit is necessary so that the United States Government and the governments of other countries can stabilize the value of coins and currencies of a country.
<br>
<br>(b) Under an agreement under subsection (a) of this section, the Board shall permit the banks (and the Board is authorized to permit the banks notwithstanding another law) to agree that the banks will—
<br>
<br>(1) conduct through each entire specified period open market operations in obligations of the United States Government or corporations in which the Government is the majority stockholder; and
<br>
<br>(2) buy directly and hold an additional $3,000,000,000 of obligations of the Government for each agreed period, unless the Secretary consents to the sale of the obligations before the end of the period.
<br>
<br>(c) With the approval of the Secretary, the Board may require Federal reserve banks to take action the Secretary and Board consider necessary to prevent unreasonable credit expansion.
