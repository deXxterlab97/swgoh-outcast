<br>the land of Gilead. 10And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the land east of Gilead.
<br>11And the sons of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salcah: 12Joel the chief, and Shapham the second, and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan; 13and their brethren of their fathers’houses: Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jacan, and Zia, and Eber, seven. 14These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jehishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; 15Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of their fathers’houses. 16And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in the towns thereof, and in all the open lands of the plain, upon their borders. 17All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
<br>18The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, as many as were valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were forty and four thousand seven hundred and threescore, that were able to go forth to war. 19And they made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. 20And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with
<br> 
<br>them; for they cried to God in the battle, and He was entreated of them, because they put their trust in Him. 21And they took away their cattle: of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand; and of souls of men a hundred thousand. 22For there fell many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.
<br>23And the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan unto Baal-hermon and Senir and mount Hermon, where they increased. 24And these were the heads of their fathers’houses: Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, heads of their fathers’houses.
<br>25And they broke faith with the God of their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed before them. 26And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river of Gozan, unto this day.

<br>34But Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of burnt-offering, and upon the altar of incense, for all the work of the most holy place, and to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded. 35And these are the sons of Aaron: Eleazar his son, Phinehas his son, Abishua his son; 36Bukki his son, Uzzi his son, Zerahiah his son; 37Meraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son; 38Zadok his son, Ahimaaz his son.
<br>39Now these are their dwelling- places according to their encampments in their borders: to the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, for
<br> 
<br>theirs was the [first] lot, 40to them they gave Hebron in the land of Judah, and the open land round about it; 41but the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 42And to the sons of Aaron they gave the acity of refuge, Hebron; Libnah also with the open land about it, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa with the open land about it; 43and Hilen with the open land about it, Debir with the open land about it; 44and Ashan with the open land about it, and Beth- shemesh with the open land about it; 45and out of the tribe of Benjamin: Geba with the open land about it, and Alemeth with the open land about it, and Anathoth with the open land about it.

All these were of the sons of Benjamin.
<br>
<br>So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel; and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their transgression.		2Now		the			first inhabitants		that				dwelt			in		their possessions	in		their	cities	were, Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim. 3And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: 4Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah. 5And of the Shilonites: Asaiah the first-born and his sons. 6And of the sons	of	Zerah:			Jeuel,		and		their
<br> 
<br>brethren, six hundred and ninety. 7And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah, 8and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibneiah; 9and their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were heads of fathers’houses by their fathers’houses.
<br>10And of the priests: Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin; 11and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; 12and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; 13and their brethren, heads of their fathers’houses, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.
<br>14And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 15and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; 16and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
<br> 
<br>17And the porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brother Shallum the chief; 18who hitherto waited in the king’s gate eastward; they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi. 19And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of his father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the Tent; and their fathers had been over the camp of the LORD, keepers of the entry; 20and Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, the LORD being with him. 21Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tent of meeting. 22All these that were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office. 23So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, even the house of the Tent, by wards. 24On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. 25And their brethren, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them; 26for the four chief porters were in a set office. These were the Levites.
<br>They were also over the chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God. 27And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge
<br> 
<br>thereof was upon them, and to them pertained the opening thereof morning by morning. 28And certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by tale were they brought in and by tale were they taken out. 29Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the holy vessels, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. 30And some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices. 31And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were baked on griddles. 32And some of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the showbread, to prepare it every sabbath.
<br>33And these are the singers, heads of fathers’houses of the Levites, who dwelt in the chambers and were free from other service; for they were employed in their work day and night. 34These were heads of fathers’houses of the Levites, by their generations, chief men; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
<br>35And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife’s name was Maacah; 36and his first-born son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab; 37and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38And Mikloth begot Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren.
<br> 
<br>39And Ner begot Kish; and Kish begot Saul; and Saul begot Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 40And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and aMerib-baal begot Micah. 41And the sons of Micah: Pithon, and Melech, and Taharea[,band Ahaz]. 42And Ahaz begot Jarah; and Jarah begot Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begot Moza. 43And Moza begot Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 44And Azel had six sons, whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.
<br>
<br>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
<br>Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 2And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 3And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was in anguish by reason of the archers. 4Then said Saul unto his armour-bearer: ‘Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and make a mock of me.’ But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
<br>
<br>a Heb. Meri-baal.
<br>b See ch. viii, 35.
<br> 
<br>5And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died. 6So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together. 7And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that [Israel] fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
<br>8And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 9And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people. 10And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. 11And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 12all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the terebinth in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
<br>13So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, because of the word of the LORD, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of a ghost, to inquire thereby, 14and inquired not of the LORD; therefore He slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
<br> 
<br>Then		all	Israel	gathered themselves	to		David	unto Hebron, saying: ‘Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 2In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD thy God said unto thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over My people Israel.’ 3So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word
<br>of the LORD by the hand of Samuel.
<br>4And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem—the same is Jebus—and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 5And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: ‘Thou shalt not come in hither.’ Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. 6And David said: ‘Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.’ And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. 7And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David. 8And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 9And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD of hosts was with him.
<br>10Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who held strongly with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the
<br> 
<br>LORD concerning Israel. 11And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.
<br>12And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 13He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 14But they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.
<br>15And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, unto the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 16And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth- lehem. 17And David longed, and said: ‘Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate! ’ 18And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth- lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD, 19and said: ‘My God forbid it me, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.’ Therefore he would not
<br> 
<br>drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
<br>20And aAbishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. 21Of the three in the second rank he was the most honourable, and was made their captain; howbeit he attained not to the first three.
<br>22Beniah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. 23And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 24These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. 25Behold, he was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three; and David set him over his guard.
<br>26Also the mighty men of valour: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 27Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite; 28Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite; 29Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite; 30Mahrai the Netophathite,
<br>
<br>a Heb. Abshai.
<br> 
<br>Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite; 31Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite; 32Hurai of Nahale-gaash, Abiel the Arbathite; 33Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite; 34the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite; 35Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur; 36Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite; 37Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai; 38Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri; 39Zelek the Ammonite, Nahrai the Berothite, the armour-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah; 40Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; 41Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai; 42Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him; 43Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite; 44Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite; 45Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite; 46Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 47Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
<br>Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he
<br>was yet shut up because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. 2They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in
<br> 
<br>slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow; they were of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin. 3The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite; 4and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; 5and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; 6Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Hariphite; 7Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 8and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of the troop.
<br>9And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valour, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 10Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third; 11Mashmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth; 12Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh; 13Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth; 14Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. 15These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host; he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand. 16These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all its banks; and they put to flight all them
<br> 
<br>of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
<br>17And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David. 18And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them: ‘If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if ye be come to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and give judgment.’ 19Then the spirit clothed Amasai, who was chief of the captains:
<br>Thine are we, David,
<br>And on thy side, thou son of Jesse; Peace, peace be unto thee,
<br>And peace be to thy helpers; For thy God helpeth thee.
<br>Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
<br>20Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but athey helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying: ‘He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.’ 21As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh. 22And they helped David against the troop, for they were all mighty men of valour, and were
<br>
<br>a That is, David and his men.
<br> 
<br>captains in the host. 23For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.
<br>24And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. 25The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war. 26Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. 27Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 28And Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; 29and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains. 30And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. 31And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers’houses. 32And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. 33And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. 34Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host,
<br> 
<br>that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand; and that could order the battle array, and were not of double heart. 35And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 36And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 37And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand. 38And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand. 39All these, being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a whole heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 40And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them. 41Moreover they that were nigh unto them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victual of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.
<br>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. 2And David said unto all the assembly
<br> 
<br>of Israel: ‘If it seem good unto you, and if it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad everywhere unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites that are in their cities that have open land about them, that they may gather themselves unto us; 3and let us bring back the ark of our God to us; for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.’ 4And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 5So David assembled all Israel together, from Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
<br>6And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, the LORD that sitteth upon the cherubim, whereon is called the Name. 7And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, [and brought it] out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 8And David and all Israel played before God with all their might; even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 9And when they came unto the threshing- floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 10And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and He smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God. 11And David was
<br> 
<br>displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzza; and that place was called aPerez-uzza unto this day. 12And David was afraid of God that day, saying: ‘How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?’ 13So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 14And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
<br>And Huram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and
<br>cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 2And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted exceedingly, for His people Israel’s sake.
<br>3And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begot more sons and daughters. 4And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; 5and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet; 6and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia; 7and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
<br>8And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out to meet them. 9Now the Philistines had come and made a raid
<br>
<br>a That is, The breach of Uzza.
<br> 
<br>in the valley of Rephaim. 10And David inquired of God, saying: ‘Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?’ And the LORD said unto him: ‘Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.’ 11So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said: ‘God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters.’ Therefore they called the name of that place aBaal-perazim. 12And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
<br>13And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 14And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry- trees. 15And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.’ 16And David did as God commanded him; and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 17And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
<br>And [David] made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 2Then David
<br>
<br>a That is, The possessor of breaches.
<br> 
<br>said: ‘None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of the LORD, and to minister unto Him for ever.’ 3And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto its place, which he had prepared for it. 4And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites; 5of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty; 6of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty; 7of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty; 8of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred; 9of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore; 10of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. 11And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 12and said unto them: ‘Ye are the heads of the fathers’houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it. 13For because ye [bore it] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought Him not according to the ordinance.’ 14So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. 15And the children of the
<br> 
<br>Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the bars thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
<br>16And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. 17So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 18and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed- edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 19So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan [, were appointed], with cymbals of brass to sound aloud; 20and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth; 21and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiahu, and Obed- edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith, to lead. 22And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song; he was master in the song, because he was skilful. 23And Berechiah and Elkanah were door- keepers for the ark. 24And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with
<br> 
<br>the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
<br>25So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed- edom with joy. 26And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams. 27And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the singers in the song; and David had upon him an ephod of linen. 28Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps. 29And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and making merry; and she despised him in her heart.
<br>And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of
<br>the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. 2And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 3And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and
<br> 
<br>woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake.
<br>4And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD, the God of Israel: 5Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 6and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
<br>7Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto the LORD, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
<br>8O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name;
<br>Make known His doings among the peoples.
<br>9Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him;
<br>Speak ye of all His marvellous works.
<br>10Glory ye in His holy name;
<br>Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
<br>11Seek ye the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
<br>12Remember His marvellous works that He hath done,
<br>His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;
<br>13O ye seed of Israel His servant,
<br>Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
<br> 
<br>14He is the LORD our God;
<br>His judgments are in all the earth.
<br>15Remember His covenant for ever,
<br>The word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
<br>16[The covenant] which He made with Abraham,
<br>And His oath unto Isaac;
<br>17And He established it unto Jacob for a statute,
<br>To Israel for an everlasting covenant;
<br>18Saying: ‘Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
<br>The lot of your inheritance.’
<br>
<br>19When ye were but a few men in number,
<br>Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,
<br>20And when they went about from nation to nation,
<br>And from one kingdom to another people,
<br>21He suffered no man to do them wrong,
<br>Yea, for their sake He reproved kings:
<br>22’Touch not Mine anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.’
<br>
<br>23Sing unto the LORD, all the earth;
<br>Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
<br>24Declare His glory among the nations,
<br>His marvellous works among all the peoples.
<br>25For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised;
<br> 
<br>He also is to be feared above all gods.
<br>26For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought;
<br>But the LORD made the heavens.
<br>27Honour and majesty are before Him;
<br>Strength and gladness are in His place.
<br>28Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples,
<br>Ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.
<br>29Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name;
<br>Bring an offering, and come before Him;
<br>Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
<br>30Tremble before Him, all the earth;
<br>The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
<br>31Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
<br>And let them say among the nations: ‘The LORD reigneth.’
<br>32Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
<br>Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
<br>33Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy,
<br>Before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth.
<br>
<br>34O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good;
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>35And say ye: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation,
<br>And gather us together and deliver us from the nations,
<br>That we may give thanks unto Thy holy name,
<br>That we may triumph in Thy praise.’
<br>36Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
<br>From everlasting even to everlasting.
<br>And all the people said: ‘Amen, ‘and praised the LORD.
<br>37So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required; 38and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed- edom also the son of Jedithun and Hosah to be door-keepers; 39and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, 40to offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the Law of the LORD, which He commanded unto Israel; 41and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His mercy endureth for ever; 42and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals, and with instruments for the songs of God; and
<br> 
<br>the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. 43And all the people departed every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
<br>And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that
<br>David said to Nathan the prophet: ‘Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD dwelleth under curtains.’ 2And Nathan said unto David: ‘Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.’ 3And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying: 4’Go and tell David My servant: Thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt not build Me a house to dwell in; 5for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day; but have [gone] from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle [to another[. 6In all places wherein I have walked among all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? 7Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people Israel; 8and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 9And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may
<br> 
<br>dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, 10even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house. 11And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 12He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 13I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; 14but I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.’ 15According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
<br>16Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said: ‘Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? 17And this was a small thing in Thine eyes, O God; but Thou hast spoken of Thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me after the manner of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 18What can David say yet more unto Thee concerning the honour which is done to Thy servant? for Thou knowest Thy
<br> 
<br>servant. 19O LORD, for Thy servant’s sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 20O LORD, there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 21And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, to make Thee a name by great and tremendous things, in driving out nations from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem out of Egypt. 22For Thy people Israel didst Thou make Thine own people for ever; and Thou, LORD, becamest their God. 23And now, O LORD, let the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. 24Yea, let it be established, and let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Thy servant shall be established before Thee. 25For Thou, O my God, hast revealed to Thy servant that Thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray before Thee. 26And now, O LORD, Thou alone art God, and hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; 27and now it hath pleased Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O LORD, hast blessed,
<br> 
<br>and so let [Thy servant] be blessed for ever.’
<br>And after this it came to pass, that	David	smote	the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the
<br>hand of the Philistines.
<br>2And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents.
<br>3And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah by Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. 4And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. 5And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men. 6Then David put [garrisons] in Aram Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 7And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
<br>9And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, 10he
<br> 
<br>sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him—because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer had wars with Tou—and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. 11These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 12Moreover aAbishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand. 13And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
<br>14And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. 15And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder. 16And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 17and Beniah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the   king of   the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 2And David said:
<br>
<br>a Heb. Abshai, and in xix. 11, 15.
<br> 
<br>‘l will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.’ So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 3But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun: ‘Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?’ 4So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their hips, and sent them away. 5Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said: ‘Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.’
<br>6And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Aram-naharaim, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. 7So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 8And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the
<br> 
<br>host of the mighty men. 9And the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
<br>10Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans. 11And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 12And he said: ‘If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 13Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the LORD do that which seemeth Him good.’ 14So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle to meet the Arameans; and they fled before him. 15And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
<br>16And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Arameans that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. 17And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon
<br> 
<br>them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him. 18And the Arameans fled before Israel; and David slew of the Arameans the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 19And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him; neither would the Arameans help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year,
<br>at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it. 2And David took the crown of Malcam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head; and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. 3And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
<br>4And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the
<br> 
<br>Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giants; and they were subdued. 5And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 6And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born unto the giant. 7And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. 8These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
<br>And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to
<br> 
<br>hundred three-score and ten thousand men that drew sword. 6But Levi and Benjamin he did not number among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
<br>7And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He smote Israel. 8And David said unto God: ‘I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing; but now, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.’ 9And the LORD spoke unto Gad, David’s seer, saying: 10’Go and speak unto David, saying: Thus saith the LORD: I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.’ 11So Gad came to David, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Take which thou wilt:
<br> 
<br>number Israel. 2And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people: ‘Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.’ 3And Joab said: ‘The LORD make His people a hundred times so many more as they are; but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?’ 4Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 5And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword; and Judah was four
<br> 
<br>12either three years of famine; or three months to be swept away before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent me.’ 13And David said unto Gad: ‘I am in a great strait; let me fall now into the hand of the LORD, for very great are His mercies; and let me not fall into the hand of man.’
<br>14So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 15And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was about to destroy, the LORD beheld, and He repented Him of
<br> 
<br>the evil, and said to the destroying angel: ‘It is enough; now stay thy hand.’ And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 16And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD standing between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 17And David said unto God: ‘Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, O LORD my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against Thy people, that they should be plagued.’
<br>18Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 19And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD. 20And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 21And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing- floor, and bowed down to David with his face to the ground. 22Then David said to Ornan: ‘Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the LORD; for the full price shalt thou give it me; that the
<br> 
<br>plague may be stayed from the people.’ 23And Ornan said unto David: ‘Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt- offerings, and the threshing- instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all’24And king David said to Ornan: ‘Nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer a burnt- offering without cost.’ 25So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 26And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt- offering. 27And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof.
<br>28At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 29For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. 30But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
<br>Then David said: ‘This is the house of the LORD God, and
<br>this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.’
<br> 
<br>2And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 3And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight; 4and cedar-trees without number; for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David. 5And David said: ‘Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries; I will therefore make preparation for him.’ So David prepared abundantly before his death.
<br>6Then He called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. 7And David said to Solomon: ‘My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God. 8But the word of the LORD came to me, saying: Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars; thou shalt not build a house unto My name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in My sight. 9Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be aSolomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. 10He
<br>
<br>a That is, Peaceful.
<br> 
<br>shall build a house for My name; and he shall be to Me for a son, and I will be to him for a father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 11Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as He hath spoken concerning thee. 12Only the LORD give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 13Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel; be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed. 14Now, behold, in my straits I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. 15Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in any manner of work; 16of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.’
<br>17David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son: 18’Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath He not given you rest on every side? for He hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my
<br> 
<br>hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before His people. 19Now set your heart and your soul to seek after the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.’
<br>Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon
<br> 
<br>therefore they became a fathers’house in one reckoning.
<br>12The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 13The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should be sanctified as most holy, he and his sons for ever, to offer before the LORD, to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name for ever. 14But as for Moses the man of God, his sons are
<br> 
<br>his son king over Israel. 2And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 3And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 4Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges; 5and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised the LORD ‘with the instruments which I made to praise therewith.’
<br>6And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 7Of the Gershonites: Ladan, and Shimei. 8The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 9The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’houses of Ladan. 10And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 11And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons;
<br> 
<br>named among the tribe of Levi. 15The sons of Moses: Gershom, and Eliezer. 16The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 17And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 18The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 19The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 20The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
<br>21The sons of Merari: Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar, and Kish. 22And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their brethren the sons of Kish took them to wife. 23The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
<br>24These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’houses, even the heads of the fathers’houses, according to their muster, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from twenty years old and upward. 25For David said: ‘The LORD, the God of
<br> 
<br>Israel, hath given rest unto His people, and He dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever; 26and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.’ 27For by the last ordinances of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward. 28For their station was at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God; 29for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked on the griddle, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size; 30and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; 31and to offer all burnt-offerings unto the LORD, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and in the appointed seasons, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually, before the LORD; 32and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of the LORD.
<br>And the courses of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of
<br>Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children;     therefore     Eleazar     and
<br> 
<br>Ithamar executed the priest’s office. 3And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 4And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’houses, eight. 5Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for they were princes of the sanctuary and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 6And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the priests and of the Levites: one father’s house being taken for Eleazar, and proportionately for Ithamar.
<br>7Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah; 8the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim; 9the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin; 10the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah; 11the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah; 12the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim; 13the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab; 14the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer; 15the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez; 16the nineteenth to
<br> 
<br>Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel; 17the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul; 18the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 19These were the orderings of them in their service, to come into the house of the LORD according to the ordinance given unto them by the hand of Aaron their father, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
<br>20And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. 21Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 22Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. 23And Benai, Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 24The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. 25The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. 26The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, his son, 27even the sons of Merari through Jaaziah his son: Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 28Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 29Of Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. 30And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’houses. 31These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the priests and of the Levites; the
<br> 
<br>fathers’houses of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
<br>Moreover David and the captains of the host separated
<br>for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals; and the number of them that did the work according to their service was: 2of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph; under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied according to the direction of the king. 3Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six; under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising the LORD. 4Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth; 5all these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the things pertaining to God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 6All these were under the hands of their fathers for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the direction of the king—Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. 7And the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in singing unto the
<br> 
<br>LORD, even all that were skilful, was two hundred fourscore and eight. 8And they cast lots ward against [ward], as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
<br>9Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph;
<br>The second to Gedaliah; he and his brethren and sons were twelve;
<br>10The third to Zaccur, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>11The fourth to Izri, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>12The fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>13The sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>14The seventh to Jesarelah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>15The eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>16The ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>17The tenth to Shimei, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>18The eleventh to Azarel, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>19The twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>20For the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>21For the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>22For the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>23For the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br> 
<br>24For the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>25For the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his brethren, twelve; 2
<br>6For the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>27For the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>28For the one and twentieth to Hothir, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>29For the two and twentieth to Giddalti, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>30For the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
<br>31For the four and twentieth to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his brethren, twelve.
<br>
<br>For	the	courses	of	the doorkeepers: of the Korahites: Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 2And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth; 3Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. 4And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth; 5Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. 6Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of
<br> 
<br>valour. 7The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael and Obed and Elzabad his brethren, valiant men; Elihu also, and Semachiah. 8All these were of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service; threescore and two of Obed-edom. 9And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, valiant men, eighteen. 10Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief—for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief—11Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.
<br>12These courses of the doorkeepers, even the chief men, had wards over against their brethren, to minister in the house of the LORD. 13And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to their fathers’houses, for every gate. 14And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a discreet counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 15To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the Storehouse. 16To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goeth up, ward against ward. 17Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the Storehouse two and two. 18For the Precinct westward, four at the causeway, and two at the Precinct. 19These were the courses of
<br> 
<br>the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.
<br>20And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God, and over the treasuries of the hallowed things. 21The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to	Ladan,			the	heads		of		the fathers’houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. 22The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasuries of the house of the LORD. 23Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites;		24Shebuel		the		son			of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries. 25And his brethren by Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son. 26This aShelomith and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king,		and			the	heads		of		the fathers’houses,		the		captains	over thousands	and	hundreds,	and		the captains of the host, had dedicated. 27Out of the spoil won in battles did they dedicate to repair the house of the LORD. 28And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren. 29Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sorts were for the outward business
<br>
<br>a Heb. Shelomoth.
<br> 
<br>over Israel, for officers and judges. 30Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward; for all the business of the LORD, and for the service of the king. 31Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’houses. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead. 32And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers’houses, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king.
<br>Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
<br>heads of fathers’houses and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers that served the king, in any matter of the courses which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand. 2Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 3Of the children of Perez was he, and the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month. 4And over the course of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his
<br> 
<br>course, and Mikloth the ruler; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 5The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the priest, chief; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 6This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty; and of his course was Ammizabad his son. 7The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 8The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 9The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 10The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 11The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 12The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 13The tenth captain for the tenth month was Mahrai, the Netophathite, of the Zerahites; and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 14The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim; and in his
<br> 
<br>course were twenty and four thousand. 15The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel; and in his course were twenty and four thousand.
<br>16Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah; 17of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok; 18of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael; 19of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel; 20of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah; 21of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; 22of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. 23But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under; because the LORD had said He would increase Israel like to the stars of heaven. 24Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David.
<br>25And over the king’s treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel; and over the treasuries in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah; 26and over them that did the
<br> 
<br>work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub; 27and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite; and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite; 28and over the olive-trees and the sycomore-trees that were in the Lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite; and over the cellars of oil was Joash; 29and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shirtai the Sharonite; and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai; 30and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite; 31and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David’s.
<br>32Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons; 33and Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor; and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend; 34and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar; and the captain of the king’s host was Joab.
<br>And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
<br>the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and cattle of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the   mighty   men   of   valour,   unto
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem. 2Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said: ‘Hear me, my brethren, and my people; as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building. 3But God said unto me: Thou shalt not build a house for My name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. 4Howbeit the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for He hath chosen Judah to be prince, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel; 5and of all my sons—for the LORD hath given me many sons—He hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 6And He said unto me: Solomon thy son, he shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be to Me for a son, and I will be to him for a father. 7And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do My commandments and Mine ordinances, as at this day. 8Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever.
<br> 
<br>9And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever. 10Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.’
<br>11Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of the temple], and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the ark-cover; 12and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, for the courts of the house of the LORD, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the hallowed things; 13also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD: 14of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; 15by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, silver by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps
<br> 
<br>thereof, according to the use of every candlestick; 16and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; 17and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the jars, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; 18and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 19’All this [do I give thee] in writing, as the LORD hath made me wise by His hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.’
<br>20And David said to Solomon his son: ‘Be strong and of good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed; for the LORD God, even my God, is with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD be finished. 21And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God; and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service; also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.’
<br>And David the king said unto all the congregation: ‘Solomon
<br>my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. 2Now I have prepared with all my might for the
<br> 
<br>house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 3Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 4even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses; 5of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto the LORD?’
<br>6Then the princes of the fathers’houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; 7and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. 8And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a whole heart they offered willingly to the LORD; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
<br>10Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation; and David said: ‘Blessed be Thou, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 11Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and Thou art exalted as head above all. 12Both riches and honour come of Thee, and Thou rulest over all; and in Thy hand is power and might; and in Thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. 13Now therefore, our God, we thank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name. 14But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee. 15For we are strangers before Thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. 16O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build Thee a house for Thy holy name cometh of Thy hand, and is all Thine own. 17I know also, my God, that Thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have
<br> 
<br>willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy Thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto Thee. 18O LORD, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever, even the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and direct their heart unto Thee; 19and give unto Solomon my son a whole heart, to keep Thy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made, provision.’
<br>20And David said to all the congregation: ‘Now bless the LORD your God.’ And all the congregation blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves before the LORD, and before the king. 21And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink- offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; 22and did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. 23Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel hearkened to him. 24And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise
<br> 
<br>of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 25And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
<br>26Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 27And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
<br> 
<br>reigned he in Jerusalem. 28And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 29Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of Samuel the seer, and in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Gad the seer; 30with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

<br>SECOND CHRONICLES
<br> 
<br>AND SOLOMON the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
<br>and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 2And Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’houses. 3So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. 4But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 5Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, had been put before the tabernacle of the LORD; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. 6And Solomon offered there, upon the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, he offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
<br>7In that night did God, appear unto Solomon, and said unto him: ‘Ask what I shall give thee.’ 8And Solomon said unto God: ‘Thou hast shown great kindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead. 9Now, O LORD God, let Thy promise unto David my father be established; for
<br> 
<br>Thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 10Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this Thy people, that is so great?’ 11And God said to Solomon: ‘Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge My people, over whom I have made thee king; 12wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.’ 13So Solomon came [from his journey] to the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.
<br>14And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 15And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. 16And the horses which Solomon had were
<br> 
<br>brought out of Egypt; also out of Keve, the king’s merchants buying them of the men of Keve at a price. 17And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means.
<br>18Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a
<br>house for his kingdom. 1And Solomon counted out threescore
<br>and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 2And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying: ‘As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein [, even so deal with me]. 3Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed seasons of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. 4And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods. 5But who is able to build Him a house, seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? who am I then, that I should build Him a house,
<br> 
<br>save only to offer before Him? 6Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to grave all manner of gravings, to be with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.   7Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees, and sandal-wood, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 8even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful. 9And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.’
<br>10Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: ‘Because the LORD loveth His people, He hath made thee king over them.’ 11Huram said moreover: ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom. 12And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, even Huram my master craftsman, 13the son of a woman of the
<br> 
<br>daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; to do whatever may be set before him, with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father. 14Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants; 15and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.’
<br>16And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred. 17And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.
<br>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount	Moriah,	where	[the	LORD] appeared unto David his father; for which provision had been made in the Place of David, in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 2And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
<br> 
<br>3Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the ancient measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 4And the porch that was before [the house], the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 5And the greater house he covered with cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains. 6And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim. 7He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
<br>8And he made the most holy place; the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. 9And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
<br>10And in the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold. 11And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 12And the
<br> 
<br>wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub. 13The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
<br>14And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.
<br>15Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
<br>16And he made chains in the Sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 17And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
<br>Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height
<br>thereof.
<br>2Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 3And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast
<br> 
<br>when it was cast. 4It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. 5And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.
<br>6He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
<br>7And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
<br>8He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
<br>9Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
<br>10And he set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward, toward the south.
<br>11And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God: 12the two pillars, and the
<br> 
<br>bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 13and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars. 14He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases; 15one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. 16The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his master craftsman make for king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. 17In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 18Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
<br>19And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread; 20and the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; 21and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold; 22and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold. And as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, were of gold.
<br> 
<br>Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of the LORD
<br>was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had hallowed; even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
<br>2Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. 3And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. 4And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 5And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 6And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. 7And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. 8For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 9And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen
<br> 
<br>without; and there they are unto this day. 10There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
<br>11And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place—for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses; 12also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets—13it came even to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD: ‘for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever’; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD, 14so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
<br>Then spoke Solomon:
<br>The LORD hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
<br>2But I have built Thee a house of habitation,
<br> 
<br>And a place for Thee to dwell in for ever.
<br>3And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel stood. 4And he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hands fulfilled it, saying: 5Since the day that I brought forth My people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that My name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over My people Israel; 6but I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name might be there; and have chosen David to be over My people Israel. 7Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 8But the LORD said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart; 9nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name. 10And the LORD hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 11And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with the children of Israel.’

<br>12And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands—13for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven—14and he said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in the heaven, or in the earth; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; 15who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day. 16Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him, saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel; if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in My law as thou hast walked before Me. 17Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, let Thy word be verified, which Thou spokest unto Thy servant David.
<br>18But will God in very truth dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house which I have builded! 19Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of
<br> 
<br>Thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee; 20that Thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said that thou wouldest put Thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place. 21And hearken Thou to the supplications of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou from Thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when Thou hearest, forgive.
<br>22If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; 23then hear Thou from heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
<br>24And if Thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, when they sin against Thee, and shall turn again and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication before Thee in this house; 25then hear Thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
<br>26When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they sin against
<br> 
<br>Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, turning from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; 27then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou dost direct them on the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.
<br>28If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be; 29what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own pain, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house; 30then hear Thou from heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest—for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men—31that they may fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers.
<br>32Moreover concerning the stranger, that is not of Thy people Israel, when be shall come out of a far country for Thy great name’s sake, and Thy mighty hand, and Thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house; 33then hear Thou from heaven, even from Thy dwelling-
<br> 
<br>place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, and fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built.
<br>34If Thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Thee toward this city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; 35then hear Thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 36If they sin against Thee—for there is no man that sinneth not—and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near; 37yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done iniquitously, and have dealt wickedly; 38if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; 39then hear Thou from heaven, even from Thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
<br> 
<br>cause; and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee.
<br>40Now, O my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and let Thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.
<br>41Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into Thy resting-place,
<br>Thou, and the ark of Thy strength;
<br>Let Thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation,
<br>And let Thy saints rejoice in good.
<br>42O LORD God, turn not away the face of Thine anointed;
<br>Remember the good deeds of David Thy servant.’
<br>
<br>Now when Solomon had made an end of   praying,   the   fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house. 2And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD’S house. 3And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and gave thanks unto the LORD; ‘for He is good, for His mercy endureth for
<br>ever.’
<br>4And the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD. 5And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.
<br> 
<br>So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 6And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made, to give thanks unto the LORD, for His mercy endureth for ever, with the praises of David by their hand; and the priests sounded trumpets over against them; and all Israel stood. 7Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt- offerings, and the fat of the peace- offerings; because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.
<br>8So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt. 9And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 10And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people.
<br>11Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. 12And the LORD appeared to
<br> 
<br>Solomon by night, and said unto him: ‘I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to Myself for a house of sacrifice. 13If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people; 14if My people, upon whom My name is called, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 15Now Mine eyes shall be open, and Mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place. 16For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that My name may be there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. 17And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; 18then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. 19But if ye turn away, and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 20then will I pluck them up by the roots out of My land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 21And this
<br> 
<br>house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say: Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 22And they shall answer: Because they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath He brought all this evil upon them.’
<br>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon
<br>had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 2that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
<br>3And Solomon went to Hamath- zobah, and prevailed against it. 4And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath. 5Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 6and Baalath, and all the store- cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
<br>7As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel; 8of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did
<br> 
<br>Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. 9But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
<br>10And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.
<br>11And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said: ‘No wife of mine shall dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.’
<br>12Then Solomon offered burnt- offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 13even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed seasons, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles. 14And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate; for so had David the man of God commanded. 15And
<br> 
<br>they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. 16So all the work of Solomon was set in order from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.
<br>17Then went Solomon to Ezion- geber, and to Eloth, on the sea-shore in the land of Edom. 18And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
<br>And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon,
<br>she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices and gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. 2And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not any thing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 3And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 4and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD;
<br> 
<br>there was no more spirit in her. 5And she said to the king: ‘It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. 6Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me; thou exceedest the fame that I heard. 7Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 8Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on His throne, to be king for the LORD thy God; because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made He thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.’
<br>9And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones; neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 10And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon that brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-wood and precious stones. 11And the king made of the sandal-wood paths for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers; and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. 12And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
<br> 
<br>13Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 14beside that which the traffickers and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 15And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target; 16three hundred shields of beaten gold also: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<br>17Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 18And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and arms on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 19And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.
<br>20And all king Solomon’s drinking- vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 21For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<br>22So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and
<br> 
<br>wisdom. 23And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 24And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<br>25And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 26And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 27And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. 28And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
<br>29Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Jedo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 30And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 31And Solomon slept with his fathers; they buried him in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
<br>And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were
<br>come to Shechem to make him king. 2And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it—for he
<br> 
<br>was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon—that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 3And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying: 4’Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.’ 5And he said unto them: ‘Come again unto me after three days.’ And the people departed.
<br>6And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: ‘What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?’ 7And they spoke unto him, saying: ‘If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.’ 8But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. 9And he said unto them: ‘What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?’ 10And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father’s
<br> 
<br>loins. 11And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’
<br>12So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: ‘Come to me again the third day.’ 13And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 14and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: ‘[My father] made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ 15So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<br>16And when all Israel [saw] that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: ‘What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.’ So all Israel departed unto their tents. 17But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 18Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the levy; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
<br> 
<br>flee to Jerusalem. 19So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
<br>And when Rehoboam was come		to		Jerusalem,			he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand	chosen		men,		that	were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam. 2But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying: 3’Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying: 4Thus saith the LORD: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren; return every man to his house, for this thing is of Me.’ So they hearkened unto the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 5And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 6He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 7and Beth-zur, and Soco, and	Adullam,	8and	Gath,		and Mareshah, and Ziph, 9and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 10and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities. 11And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and oil and wine. 12And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And
<br>Judah and Benjamin adhered to him.
<br>13And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel presented themselves to him out of all their
<br> 
<br>border. 14For the Levites left their open land and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office unto the LORD; 15and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the satyrs, and for the calves which he had made. 16And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the LORD, the God of their fathers. 17So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.
<br>18And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; 19and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. 20And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 21And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines—for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begot twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters. 22And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, even the prince among his brethren; for he was minded to make him king. 23And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah
<br> 
<br>and Benjamin, unto every fortified city; and he gave them victual in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.
<br>And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. 2And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had dealt treacherously with the LORD, 3with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. 4And he took	the		fortified			cities		which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.			5Now				Shemaiah		the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together		to   Jerusalem   because		of Shishak, and said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Ye have forsaken Me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.’ 6Then the princes of Israel		and			the			king		humbled themselves; and they said: ‘The LORD is righteous.’ 7And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying:				‘They		have		humbled themselves; I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out upon	Jerusalem	by			the	hand		of Shishak. 8Nevertheless they shall be
<br> 
<br>his servants; that they may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.’
<br>9So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all away; he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 10And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king’s house. 11And it was so, that as oft as the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber. 12And when he humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned from him, that He would not destroy him altogether; and moreover in Judah there were good things found.
<br>13So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. 14And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek the LORD.
<br>15Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars
<br> 
<br>between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 16And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam   began   Abijah   to
<br>reign over Judah. 2Three years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 3And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour. 4And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said: ‘Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel; 5ought ye not to know that the LORD, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 6Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. 7And there were gathered unto him vain men, base fellows that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted, and could not withstand them. 8And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which
<br> 
<br>Jeroboam made you for gods. 9Have ye not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same becometh a priest of them that are no gods. 10But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and we have priests ministering unto the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work; 11and they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense; the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken Him. 12And, behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.’
<br>13But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. 14And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 15Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God
<br> 
<br>smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 16And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand. 17And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 18Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD, the God of their fathers. 19And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. 20Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the LORD smote him, and he died. 21But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begot twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 22And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
<br>23So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his stead; in his days the land was quiet
<br>ten years. 1And Asa did that which was good and right in
<br>the eyes of the LORD his God; 2for he took away the strange altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim; 3and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.

<br>4Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun- images; and the kingdom was quiet before him. 5And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. 6For he said unto Judah: ‘Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side.’ So they built and prospered. 7And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand; all these were mighty men of valour.
<br>8And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. 9Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephath at Mareshah. 10And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said: ‘LORD, there is none beside Thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength; help us, O LORD our God; for we rely on Thee, and in Thy name are we come against this multitude. Thou art the LORD our God; let not man prevail against Thee.’ 11So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 12And Asa and the
<br> 
<br>people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar; and there fell of the Ethiopians so that none remained alive; for they were shattered before the LORD, and before His host; and they carried away very much booty. 13And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for a terror from the LORD came upon them; and they spoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. 14They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>And the spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded;
<br>2and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him: ‘Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the LORD is with you, while ye are with Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; but if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you. 3Now for long seasons Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law; 4but when in their distress they turned unto the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found of them. 5And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great discomfitures were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. 6And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did discomfit them with all manner of adversity. 7But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.’
<br> 
<br>8And when Asa heard these words, even the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the detestable things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD. 9And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. 10So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 11And they sacrificed unto the LORD in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. 12And they entered into the covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul; 13and that whosoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 14And they swore unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns. 15And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found of them; and the LORD gave them rest round about.
<br>16And also Maacah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from
<br> 
<br>being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 17But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole all his days. 18And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had hallowed, and that he himself had hallowed, silver, and gold, and vessels. 19And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
<br>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasa king of
<br>Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 2Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Aram, that dwelt at aDamascus, saying: 3’There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.’ 4And Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali. 5And it came   to   pass,   when   Baasa   heard
<br>
<br>a Heb. Darmesek, and in xxiv 23; xxviii, 5, 23.
<br> 
<br>thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease. 6Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
<br>7And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him: ‘Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram, and hast not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thy hand. 8Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, He delivered them into thy hand. 9For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is whole toward Him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.’ 10Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
<br>11And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 12And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great; yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. 13And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. 14And
<br> 
<br>they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers’art; and they made a very great burning for him.
<br>And		Jehoshaphat		his	son reigned	in	his	stead,	and strengthened himself against Israel. 2And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 3And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim; 4but sought to the God of his father, and walked in His commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 5Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. 6And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD; and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim
<br>out of Judah.
<br>7Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 8and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-
<br> 
<br>adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. 9And they taught in Judah, having the book of the Law of the LORD with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.
<br>10And a terror from the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 11And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats. 12And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store. 13And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem. 14And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers’houses: of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand; 15and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand; 16and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour; 17and of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; 18and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand
<br> 
<br>ready prepared for war. 19These were they that waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
<br>Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance; and
<br>he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 2And after a lapse of years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead. 3And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah: ‘Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?’ And he answered him: ‘I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.’
<br>4And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: ‘Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.’ 5Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them: ‘Shall we go to Ramoth- gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?’ And they said: ‘Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.’ 6But Jehoshaphat said: ‘Is there not here besides a prophet of the LORD, that we might inquire of him?’ 7And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.’ And Jehoshaphat said: ‘Let not the king say so.’ 8Then the king of Israel
<br> 
<br>called an officer, and said: ‘Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.’ 9Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they sat in a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 10And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.’ 11And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: ‘Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.’
<br>12And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying: ‘Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.’ 13And Micaiah said: ‘As the LORD liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.’ 14And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: ‘aMicaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?’ And he said: ‘Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.’ 15And the king said to him: ‘How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD.’ 16And he said: ‘I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep
<br>
<br>a Heb. Micah.
<br> 
<br>that have no shepherd; and the LORD said: These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.’ 17And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: ‘Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?’ 18And he said: ‘Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left. 19And the LORD said: who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. 20And there came forth the spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said: I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him: Wherewith? 21And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so. 22Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.’
<br>23Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the check, and said: ‘Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?’ 24And Micaiah said: ‘Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.’ 25And the king of Israel said: ‘Take ye Micaiah; and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city,
<br> 
<br>and to Joash the king’s son; 26and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I return in peace.’ 27And Micaiah said: ‘If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.’ And he said: ‘Hear, ye peoples, all of you.’
<br>28So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the kind of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 29And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.’ So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. 30Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying: ‘Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.’ 31And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: ‘It is the king of Israel.’ Therefore they turned about to fight against him; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. 32And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 33And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot: ‘Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.’ 34And the battle increased that day; howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot
<br> 
<br>against the Arameans until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
<br>And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
<br>peace to Jerusalem. 2And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat: ‘Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the LORD? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before the LORD. 3Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.’
<br>4And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD, the God of their fathers. 5And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 6and said to the judges: ‘Consider what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD; and [He is] with you in giving judgment. 7Now therefore let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it; for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.’ 8Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers’houses of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem. 9And he charged them, saying: ‘Thus shall ye do in the fear of
<br> 
<br>the LORD, faithfully, and with a whole heart. 10And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards the LORD, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren; thus shall ye do, and ye shall not be guilty. 11And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters; also the officers of the Levites before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD be with the good.’
<br>And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and
<br>the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 2Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying: ‘There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Aram; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar’—the same is En- gedi. 3And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto the LORD; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 4And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of the LORD; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. 5And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court; 6and he said: ‘O LORD, the God of our
<br> 
<br>fathers, art not Thou alone God in heaven? and art not Thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in Thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand Thee. 7Didst not Thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham Thy friend for ever? 8And they dwelt therein, and have built Thee a sanctuary therein for Thy name, saying: 9If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before Thee—for Thy name is in this house—and cry unto Thee in our affliction, and Thou wilt hear and save. 10And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom Thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not; 11behold, they render unto us [evil], to come to cast us out of Thy possession, which Thou hast given us to inherit. 12O our God, wilt Thou not execute judgment on them? for we have no might against this great multitude that cometh against us; neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon Thee.’ 13And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. 14Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
<br> 
<br>congregation; 15and he said: ‘Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: thus saith the LORD unto you: Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. 16To-morrow go ye down against them; behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 17Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed; to-morrow go out against them; for the LORD is with you.’ 18And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. 19And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.
<br>20And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said: ‘Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe His prophets, so shall ye prosper.’ 21And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto the LORD, and praise in the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and
<br> 
<br>say: ‘Give thanks unto the LORD, for His mercy endureth for ever.’ 22And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. 23For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
<br>24And when Judah came to the watch- tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped. 25And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much. 26And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of aBeracah; for there they blessed the LORD; therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah, unto this day. 27Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 28And they came to
<br>
<br>a That is, Blessing.
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. 29And a terror from God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. 30So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.
<br>31And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah; he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 32And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD. 33Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 34Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.
<br>35And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly; 36and he joined him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. 37Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying: ‘Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath made a breach in thy works.’ And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
<br> 
<br>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
<br>his fathers in the city of David; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 2And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariahu, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 3And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born. 4Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom	of	his	father,	and	had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. 5Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 6And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 7Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and as He promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway. 8In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 9Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots. 10So Edom revolted
<br> 
<br>from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers. 11Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, and drew Judah away. 12And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah; 13but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, like as the house of Ahab made [Israel] to go astray; and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself; 14behold, the LORD will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance; 15and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’
<br>16And the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians; 17and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
<br> 
<br>18And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 19And it came to pass, that in process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 20Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed joyless; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
<br>And	the	inhabitants	of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 2Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 3He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. 4And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction. 5He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth- gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. 6And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they
<br> 
<br>had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
<br>7Now the downfall of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. 8And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them. 9And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him—now he was hiding in Samaria—and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said: ‘He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.’ And there was none of the house of Ahaziah that had power to hold the kingdom.
<br>10Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 11But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bed-chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest—for she was the sister of Ahaziah—hid him from Athaliah, so
<br> 
<br>that she slew him not. 12And he was with them hid in the house of God six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land.
<br>And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself,
<br>and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 2And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 3And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them: ‘Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD hath spoken concerning the sons of David. 4This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; 5and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. 6But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the charge of the LORD. 7And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let
<br> 
<br>him be slain; and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.’
<br>8So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. 9And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God. 10And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about. 11Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown and the insignia, and made him king; and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said: ‘Long live the king.’
<br>12And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD; 13and she looked, and, behold, the king stood on his platform at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; the singers also [played] on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said: ‘Treason, treason.’ 14And Jehoiada the priest brought out the
<br> 
<br>captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them: ‘Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword’; for the priest said: ‘Slay her not in the house of the LORD.’ 15So they made way for her; and she went to the entry of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they slew her there.
<br>16And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be the LORD’S people. 17And all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 18And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt-offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the direction of David. 19And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none that was unclean in any thing should enter in. 20And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD; and they came through the upper gate unto the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 21So all the people of the land rejoiced,
<br> 
<br>and the city was quiet; and they slew Athaliah with the sword.
<br>Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and
<br>he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 2And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begot sons and daughters.
<br>4And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of the LORD. 5And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them: ‘Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.’ Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. 6And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and unto him: ‘Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?’ 7For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the hallowed things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon the Baalim.
<br>8So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. 9And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant
<br> 
<br>of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness. 10And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 11And it was so, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it back to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 12And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of the LORD. 13So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it. 14And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels wherewith to minister, and buckets, and pans, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt- offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
<br>15But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. 16And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward
<br> 
<br>God and His house. 17Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and prostrated themselves before the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 18And they forsook the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness. 19Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back unto the LORD; and they admonished them, but they would not give ear.
<br>20And the spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them: ‘Thus saith God: Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, He hath also forsaken you.’ 21And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 22Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said: ‘The LORD look upon it, and require it.’
<br>23And it came to pass, when the year was come about, that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 24For the army of the Arameans came with a small company
<br> 
<br>of men; and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash. 25And when they were departed from him—for they left him in great diseases—his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 26And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 27Now concerning his sons, and the multitude of the burdens against him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to
<br>reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not with a whole heart. 3Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants who had killed the king his father. 4But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as the LORD commanded, saying: ‘The fathers
<br> 
<br>shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.’
<br>5Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 6He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 7But there came a man of God to him, saying: ‘O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim. 8But if thou wilt go, and do engage never so valiantly in battle, God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.’ 9And Amaziah said to the man of God: ‘But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?’ And the man of God answered: ‘The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.’ 10Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go back home; wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
<br>11And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the
<br> 
<br>Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. 12And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the Rock, and cast them down from the top of the Rock, that they all were broken in pieces. 13But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
<br>14Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and prostrated himself before them, and offered unto them. 15Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him: ‘Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?’ 16And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said unto him: ‘Have we made thee of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?’ Then the prophet forbore, and said: ‘I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.’
<br>17Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: ‘Come, let us look one another in the face.’ 18And Joash king
<br> 
<br>of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying: ‘The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there passed by the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle. 19Thou sayest—lo, thou hast smitten Edom; will thy heart therefore lift thee up to glory therein? abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle with evil, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?’ 20But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that He might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought after the gods of Edom. 21So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 22And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. 23And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 24And [he took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God	with	Obed-edom,	and	the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 25And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 26Now the rest of the acts
<br> 
<br>of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 27Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 28And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
<br>And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
<br>years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 2He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 3Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 4And he did that, which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. 5And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
<br>6And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the country of] Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 7And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the
<br> 
<br>Meunim. 8And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah; and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong. 9Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the Turning, and fortified them. 10And be built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the Lowland also, and in the table-land; and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.
<br>11Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. 12The whole number of the heads of fathers’houses, even the mighty men of valour, was two thousand and six hundred. 13And under their hand was a trained army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 14And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging. 15And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the corners, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far
<br> 
<br>abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
<br>16But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the LORD his God; for he went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. 17And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men; 18and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him: ‘It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron that are consecrated it pertaineth to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thy honour from the LORD God.’ 19Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense. 20And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself made haste also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. 21And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD; and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land. 22Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,
<br> 
<br>write. 23So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said: ‘He is a leper’; and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to
<br>reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 2And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly. 3He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. 4Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forest he built castles and towers. 5He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third. 6So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. 7Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 8He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen   years   in   Jerusalem.   9And
<br> 
<br>Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and
<br>he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, like David his father; 2but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim. 3Moreover he offered in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 4And he sacrificed and offered in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. 5Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. 6For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. 7And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. 8And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and took also away
<br> 
<br>much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
<br>9But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them: ‘Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, He hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up unto heaven. 10And now ye purpose to bring the children of Judah and Jerusalem into subjection for bondmen and bondwomen unto you; but are there not even with you acts of guilt of your own against the LORD your God? 11Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.’ 12Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, 13and said unto them: ‘Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; for ye purpose that which will bring upon us guilt against the LORD, to add unto our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.’ 14So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 15And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked
<br> 
<br>among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren; then they returned to Samaria.
<br>16At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 17For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. 18The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the Lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof; and they dwelt there. 19For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had cast away restraint in Judah, and acted treacherously against the LORD. 20And Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. 21For Ahaz stripped the house of the LORD, and the house of the king and the princes, and gave thereof unto the king of Assyria; but it helped him not.
<br>22And in the time of his distress did he act even more treacherously against the LORD, this same king Ahaz. 23For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said: ‘Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.’ But they were the ruin of him,
<br> 
<br>and of all Israel. 24And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25And in every city of Judah he made high places to offer unto other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers. 26Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 27And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years
<br>old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 2And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. 3He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. 4And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east; 5and said unto them: ‘Hear me, ye Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. 6For our fathers have acted treacherously, and done
<br> 
<br>that which was evil in the sight of the LORD our God, and have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. 7Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. 8Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He hath delivered them to be a horror, an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes. 9For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 10Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, that His fierce anger may turn away from us. 11My sons, be not now negligent; for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before Him, to minister unto Him, and that ye should be His ministers, and offer unto Him.’
<br>12Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; 13and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 14and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 15And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified
<br> 
<br>themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. 16And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron. 17Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD; and they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. 18Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within [the palace], and said: ‘We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, even the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof. 19Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he acted treacherously, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.’
<br>20Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. 21And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin- offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of
<br> 
<br>Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD. 22So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and dashed it against the altar; and they killed the rams, and dashed the blood against the altar; they killed also the lambs, and dashed the blood against the altar. 23And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands upon them; 24and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.
<br>25And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of the LORD by His prophets. 26And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 27And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the LORD began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel. 28And all the congregation prostrated themselves, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished. 29And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed
<br> 
<br>themselves and prostrated themselves. 30Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
<br>31Then Hezekiah answered and said: ‘Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the LORD.’ And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt- offerings. 32And the number of the burnt-offerings,	which	the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt-offering to the LORD. 33And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 34But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 35And also the burnt- offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for every burnt- offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was firmly established. 36And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had
<br> 
<br>prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.
<br>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
<br>also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD, the God of Israel. 2For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 3For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 4And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the congregation. 5So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers according as it is written.
<br>6So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying: ‘Ye children of Israel, turn back unto the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that He may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. 7And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who acted treacherously against the
<br> 
<br>LORD, the God of their fathers, so that He delivered them to be an astonishment, as ye see. 8Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into His sanctuary, which He hath sanctified for ever, and serve the LORD your God, that His fierce anger may turn away from you. 9For if ye turn back unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come back into this land; for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you, if ye return unto Him.’
<br>10So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 11Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 12Also in Judah was the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the LORD. 13And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 14And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. 15Then they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month; and the priests and the Levites were
<br> 
<br>ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD. 16And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests dashed the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites. 17For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passover lambs for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. 18For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying: ‘The good LORD pardon 19every one that setteth his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification that pertaineth to holy things.’ 20And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. 21And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. 22And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that were well skilled in the service of the LORD. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and
<br> 
<br>giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
<br>23And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness. 24For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. 25And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 26So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. 27Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard [of the LORD], and their prayer came up to His holy habitation, even unto heaven.
<br>Now	when	all	this	was finished, all Israel that were
<br>present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. 2And	Hezekiah	appointed	the courses of the priest and the Levites
<br> 
<br>after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt- offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD. 3He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt- offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt- offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointed seasons, as it is written in the Law of the LORD. 4Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of the LORD. 5And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. 6And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of hallowed things which were hallowed unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps. 7In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 8And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and His people Israel. 9Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 10And Azariah
<br> 
<br>the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said: ‘Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty; for the LORD hath blessed His people; and that which is left is this great store.’
<br>11Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them. 12And they brought in the offerings and the tithes and the hallowed things faithfully; and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second. 13And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. 14And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of the LORD, and the most holy things. 15And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small; 16beside them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of the LORD, for his daily portion, for their service in their
<br> 
<br>charges according to their courses; 17and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 18even to give to them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they administered the sacred gifts; 19also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the open land about their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
<br>20And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God. 21And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
<br>After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king
<br>of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to make a breach therein for himself. 2And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 3he took counsel   with   his   princes   and   his
<br> 
<br>mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him. 4So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying: ‘Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?’ 5And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance. 6And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying: 7’Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a Greater with us than with him: 8with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles.’ And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
<br>9After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem—now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him— unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying: 10’Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria: Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem? 11Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to
<br> 
<br>give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying: The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 12Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye offer? 13Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand? 14Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand? 15Now therefore let not Hezekiah beguile you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers; how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?’
<br>16And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against His servant Hezekiah. 17He wrote also a letter, to taunt the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying: ‘As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver His people out of my hand.’ 18And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to
<br> 
<br>terrify them, and to affright them; that they might take the city. 19And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.
<br>20And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. 21And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. 22Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all, and guided them on every side. 23And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
<br>24In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death; and he prayed unto the LORD; and He spoke unto him, and gave him a sign. 25But Hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 26Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
<br> 
<br>27And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour; and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels; 28store- houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds. 29Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance. 30This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 31Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.
<br>32Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 33And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign;
<br>and he reigned fifty and five years in
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem. 2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the nations, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 3For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 4And he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD said: ‘In Jerusalem shall My name be for ever.’ 5And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 6He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit; he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him. 7And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son: ‘In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name for ever; 8neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers; if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.’ 9And Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, so that they did evil more than did the nations,
<br> 
<br>whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
<br>10And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed. 11Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. 12And when he was in distress, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. 13And he prayed unto Him; and He was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD He was God.
<br>14Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height; and he put captains of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah. 15And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. 16And he built up the altar of the LORD, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace- offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel. 17Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, but only unto the LORD their God.
<br> 
<br>18Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel. 19His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his transgression, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself; behold, they are written in the history of the seers. 20So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>21Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 22And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them. 23And he humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon became guilty more and more. 24And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house. 25But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
<br>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and
<br>he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. 2And he did that which was
<br> 
<br>right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 3For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images. 4And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images, that were on high above them, he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. 5And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 6And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their axes round about. 7And he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>8Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. 9And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the
<br> 
<br>house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the door, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jerusalem. 10And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD gave it to mend and repair the house; 11even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. 12And the men did the work faithfully; and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to preside over it; and other of the Levites, all that had skill with instruments of music. 13Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and presided over all that did the work in every manner of service; and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
<br>14And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the Law of the LORD given by Moses. 15and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe: ‘I have found the book of the Law in the house of the LORD.’ And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. 16And Shaphan carried the book to the king,
<br> 
<br>and moreover brought back word unto the king, saying: ‘All that was committed to thy servants, they do it. 17And they have poured out the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.’ 18And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying: ‘Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.’ And Shaphan read therein before the king. 19And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Law, that he rent his clothes. 20And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying: 21’Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according unto all that is written in this book.’
<br>22So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe—now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter—and they spoke to her to that effect. 23And she said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me: 24Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will bring evil upon this
<br> 
<br>place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah; 25because they have forsaken Me, and have offered unto other gods, that they might provoke Me with all the works of their hands; therefore is My wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched. 26But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard, 27because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest His words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before Me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. 28Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof.’ And they brought back word unto the king.
<br>29Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 30And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the
<br> 
<br>LORD. 31And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. 32And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 33And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. All his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
<br>And Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD   in Jerusalem;
<br>and they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. 2And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD. 3And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto the LORD: ‘Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders; now serve the LORD your God, and His people Israel. 4And prepare ye after your fathers’houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 5And stand in the
<br> 
<br>holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’houses of your brethren the children of the people, and [let there be for each] a portion of a father’s house of the Levites. 6And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.’
<br>7And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover- offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks; these were of the king’s substance. 8And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen. 9Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover- offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.
<br>10So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king’s commandment. 11And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests dashed [the blood, which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them. 12And they removed the portions that were to be burnt, that they might give them to the divisions
<br> 
<br>of the fathers’houses of the children of the people, to present unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen. 13And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. 14And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 15And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate; they needed not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
<br>16So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah. 17And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 18And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all
<br> 
<br>Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 19In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
<br>20After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him. 21But he sent ambassadors to him, saying: ‘What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath given command to speed me; forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that He destroy thee not.’ 22Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco, from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 23And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants: ‘Have me away; for I am sore wounded.’ 24So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 25And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations, unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel; and, behold, they are written in the lamentations. 26Now
<br> 
<br>the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the Law of the LORD, 27and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
<br>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
<br>Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem. 2Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 3And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 4And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
<br>5Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. 6Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 7Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 8Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
<br> 
<br>9Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 10And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
<br>11Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; 12and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD. 13And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD, the God of Israel. 14Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, transgressed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of the LORD which He had hallowed in Jerusalem. 15And the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent to them by His messengers, sending betimes and often; because He had compassion on His people, and on His dwelling-place; 16but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against His people, till there was no remedy.
<br> 
<br>17Therefore He brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man or hoary-headed; He gave them all into his hand. 18And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. 19And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 20And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia; 21to fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had been paid her sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
<br>22Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying: 23’Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among
<br> 
<br>you of all His people—the LORD  his God be with him—let him go up.’

<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.
<br>And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.
<br>And God said: Be light made. And light was made.
<br>And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
<br>And he called the light Day, and the dark- ness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
<br>And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<br>And god made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.
<br>And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.
<br>God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. 10 And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called
<br>Seas. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
<br> 
<br>
<br>And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And the evening and the morning were the third day.
<br>And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
<br>To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done. 16 And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule
<br>the night: and The stars.
<br>And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.
<br>And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
<br>God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.
<br>And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waaters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.
<br>And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
<br>And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.
<br>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.
<br>And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.
<br>And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
<br>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:
<br>And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.
<br>And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
