<br> 
<br>David his father; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah
<br>Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 2Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, like David his father. 3But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. 4And he sacrificed and offered in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree.
<br>5Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war; and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. 6At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath to Aram, and drove the Jews from aElath; and the Edomites came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day.
<br>7So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying: ‘I am thy servant and thy son; come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.’ 8And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s
<br>
<br>a Heb. Eloth.
<br> 
<br>house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. 9And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
<br>10And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. 11And Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus. 12And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon. 13And he offered his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and dashed the blood of his peace- offerings against the altar. 14And the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of his altar. 15And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying: ‘Upon the great altar offer the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king’s burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-
<br> 
<br>offering, and their drink-offerings; and dash against it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the brazen altar shall be for me to look to.’ 16Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
<br>17And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone. 18And the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he unto the house of the LORD, because of the king of Assyria. 19Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 20And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea
<br>the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years. 2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him. 3Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him presents. 4And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year;
<br> 
<br>therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. 5Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
<br>7And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, 8and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they practised; 9and the children of Israel did impute things that were not right unto the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city; 10and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every leafy tree; 11and there they offered in all the high places, as did the nations whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD; 12and they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them: ‘Ye shall not do this thing’; 13yet the LORD forewarned Israel, and Judah, by the hand of every prophet, and of every seer, saying: ‘Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep My commandments and My statutes,
<br> 
<br>according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by the hand of My servants the prophets’; 14notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in the LORD their God; 15and they rejected His statutes, and His covenant that He made with their fathers, and His testimonies wherewith He testified against them; and they went after things of nought, and became nought, and after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like them; 16and they forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal; 17and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and gave themselves over to do that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him; 18that the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. 19Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they practised. 20And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight. 21For He rent Israel from the
<br> 
<br>house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drew Israel away from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin. 22And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; 23until the LORD removed Israel out of His sight, as He spoke by the hand of all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.
<br>24And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. 25And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them. 26Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying: ‘The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.’
<br>27Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying: ‘Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.’ 28So one of the priests whom they had
<br> 
<br>carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. 29Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 30And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 31and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 32So they feared the LORD, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 33They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
<br>34Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel; 35with whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying: ‘Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them; 36but the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him shall ye fear, and Him shall ye
<br> 
<br>worship, and to Him shall ye sacrifice; 37and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which He wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods; 38and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods; 39but the LORD your God shall ye fear; and He will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.’ 40Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 41So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children’s children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
<br>Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of
<br>Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 2Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 3And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. 4He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah; and he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did offer to it; and it was called aNehushtan. 5He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel;
<br>
<br>a That is, A thing of brass.
<br> 
<br>so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him. 6For he cleaved to the LORD, he departed not from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. 7And the LORD was with him: whithersoever he went forth he prospered; and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. 8He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. 9And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. 10And at the end of three years they took it; even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 11And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes; 12because they hearkened not to the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
<br>13Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. 14And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish,
<br> 
<br>saying: ‘I have offended; return from me; that which thou puttest on me will I bear.’ And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 15And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house. 16At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the door-posts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
<br>17And   the   king   of   Assyria   sent
<br>aTartan   and   bRab-saris   and   cRab-
<br>shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fullers’field. 18And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
<br>19And Rab-shakeh said unto them: ‘Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 20Sayest thou that a mere word of the lips is counsel and strength for the war? Now on whom dost thou
<br>
<br>a That is, commander-in-chief. b That is, chief of the eunuchs. c That is, chief butler.
<br> 
<br>trust, that thou hast rebelled against me? 21Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. 22But if ye say unto me: We trust in the LORD our God; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 23Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 24How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my masters servants? and yet thou puttest thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! 25Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said unto me: Go up against this land, destroy it.’
<br>26Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh: ‘Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language; for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jews’language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.’ 27But Rab-shakeh said unto them: ‘Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?’ 28Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a
<br> 
<br>loud voice in the Jews’language, and spoke, saying: ‘Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 29Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand; 30neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying: The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 31Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 32until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive- trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die; and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying: The LORD will deliver us. 33Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 34Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 35Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’
<br>36But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying:
<br> 
<br>‘Answer him not.’ 37Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
<br>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he
<br>rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 2And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 3And they said unto him: ‘Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 4It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab- shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.’ 5So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6And Isaiah said unto them: ‘Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 7Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’
<br> 
<br>8So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 9And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: ‘Behold, he is come out to fight against thee’; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying: 10’Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 11Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? 12Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? 13Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’
<br>14And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 15And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. 16Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent
<br> 
<br>him to taunt the living God. 17Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, 18and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 19Now therefore, O LORD our God, save Thou us, I beseech Thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD God, even Thou only.’
<br>20Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee. 21This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him:
<br>The virgin daughter of Zion
<br>Hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn;
<br>The daughter of Jerusalem Hath shaken her head at thee. 22Whom hast thou taunted and Blasphemed?
<br>And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?
<br>Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high,
<br>Even against the Holy One of Israel!
<br>23By the messengers thou hast taunted the Lord,
<br>And hast said: With the multitude of my chariots
<br>Am I come up to the height of the mountains,
<br>To the innermost parts of Lebanon; And I have cut down the tall cedars
<br> 
<br>thereof,
<br>And the choice cypresses thereof; and I have entered into his farthest lodge,
<br>The forest of his fruitful field. 24I have digged and drunk Strange waters,
<br>And with the sole of my feet have I dried up
<br>All the rivers of Egypt.
<br>
<br>25Hast thou not heard? Long ago I made it,
<br>In ancient times I fashioned it; Now have I brought it to pass, Yea, it is done; that fortified cities Should be laid waste into ruinous
<br>heaps.
<br>26Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,
<br>They were dismayed and confounded;
<br>They were as the grass of the field, And as the green herb,
<br>As the grass on the housetops,
<br>And as corn blasted before it is grown up.
<br>
<br>27But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
<br>And thy raging against Me.
<br>28Because of thy raging against Me,
<br>And for that thy tumult is come up into
<br>Mine ears,
<br>Therefore will I put My hook in thy nose,
<br>And My bridle in thy lips,
<br>And I will turn thee back by the way
<br> 
<br>By which thou camest.
<br>29And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 30And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 31For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this. 32Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it. 33By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD. 34For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’
<br>35And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 36So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 37And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And
<br> 
<br>Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.’ 2Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying: 3’Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.’ And Hezekiah wept sore. 4And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out of the inner court of the city, that the word of the	LORD	came	to	him,	saying: 5’Return, and say to Hezekiah the prince of My people: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. 6And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for Mine own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’ 7And Isaiah said: ‘Take a cake of figs.’ And they took and laid it on the boil,
<br>and he recovered.
<br>8And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah: ‘What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of the LORD the third day?’ 9And Isaiah said: ‘This shall be the sign unto thee from the LORD, that
<br> 
<br>the LORD will do the thing that He hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 10And Hezekiah answered: ‘It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.’ 11And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD; and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
<br>12At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 13And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. 14Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him: ‘What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?’ And Hezekiah said: ‘They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.’ 15And he said: ‘What have they seen in thy house?’ And Hezekiah answered: ‘All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.’
<br>16And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah: ‘Hear the word of the LORD. 17Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have
<br> 
<br>laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 18And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ 19Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: ‘Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken.’ He said moreover: ‘Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?’
<br>20Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 21And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign;
<br>and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hephzi-bah. 2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the nations, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 3For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 4And he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD said: ‘In Jerusalem will I put My name.’ 5And
<br> 
<br>he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 6And he made his son to pass through	the		fire,		and	practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him. 7And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which the LORD said to David and to Solomon his son: ‘In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name for ever; 8neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the	law		that			My	servant		Moses commanded	them.’			9But			they hearkened not; and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations, whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. 10And    the    LORD      spoke by His servants			the				prophets,		saying: 11’Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols; 12therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 13And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of
<br> 
<br>Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 14And I will cast off the remnant of Mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 15because they have done that which is evil in My sight, and have provoked Me, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.’
<br>16Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 17Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 18And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>19Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 20And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father. 21And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them. 22And he forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and
<br> 
<br>walked not in the way of the LORD. 23And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house. 24But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 25Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 26And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and
<br>he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 2And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
<br>3And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying. 4’Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people; 5and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the LORD; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the  house; 6unto the
<br> 
<br>carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons; and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.’— 7Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.
<br>8And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe: ‘I have found the book of the Law in the house of the LORD.’ And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 9And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought back word unto the king, and said: ‘Thy servants have poured out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.’ 10And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying: ‘Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.’ And Shaphan read it before the king. 11And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the Law, that he rent his clothes. 12And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying: 13’Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this  book, to  do  according
<br> 
<br>unto all that which is written concerning us.’
<br>14So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe—now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter—and they spoke with her. 15And she said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me: 16Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read; 17because they have forsaken Me, and have offered unto other gods, that they might provoke Me with all the work of their hands; therefore My wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched. 18But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard, 19because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become an astonishment and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me, I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. 20Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine
<br> 
<br>eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.’ And they brought back word unto the king.
<br>And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the
<br>elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 2And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. 3And the king stood on the platform, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people stood to the covenant.
<br>4And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el. 5And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to offer in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that offered unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and
<br> 
<br>to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. 6And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the common people. 7And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of the LORD, where the women wove coverings for the Asherah. 8And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand as he entered the gate of the city. 9Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren. 10And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 11And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nethan-melech the officer, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 12And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the
<br> 
<br>altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king break down, and beat them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 13And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the detestation of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. 14And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
<br>15Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and stamped it small to powder, and burned the Asherah. 16And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things. 17Then he said: ‘What monument is that which I see’And the men of the city told him: ‘It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.’ 18And he said:
<br> 
<br>‘Let him be; let no man move his bones.’ So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 19And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [the LORD], Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el. 20And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.
<br>21And the king commanded all the people, saying: ‘Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.’ 22For there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 23but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to the LORD in Jerusalem. 24Moreover them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the detestable things that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 25And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of
<br> 
<br>Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
<br>26Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked Him. 27And the LORD said: ‘I will remove Judah also out of My sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said: My name shall be there.’
<br>28Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 29In his days Pharaoh- necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 30And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.
<br>31Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 32And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. 33And Pharaoh- necoh put him in bands at Riblah in
<br> 
<br>the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a fine of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 34And Pharaoh- necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there. 35And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh- necoh.
<br>36Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 37And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
<br>In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years; then he turned and rebelled against   him.   2And   the   LORD     sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Arameans, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by the hand of His servants the prophets. 3Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
<br> 
<br>remove them out of His sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did; 4and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the LORD would not pardon.
<br>5Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 6So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 7And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the Brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
<br>8Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months; and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 9And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. 10At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 11And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it. 12And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 13And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and
<br> 
<br>cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. 14And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 15And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 16And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 17And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
<br>18Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 19And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 20For through the anger of the LORD did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from His presence.
<br>And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 1And it came to pass in the ninth year of his
<br>reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth
<br> 
<br>day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. 2So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 3On the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 4Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden—now the Chaldeans were against the city round about—and the king went by the way of the Arabah. 5But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 6Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. 7And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
<br>8Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem. 9And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great man’s
<br> 
<br>house, burnt he with fire. 10And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about. 11And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive. 12But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
<br>13And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. 14And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the pans, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 15And the fire-pans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. 16The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 17The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits; with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass; and like unto these had the second pillar with network.
<br> 
<br>18And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door; 19and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city. 20And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 21And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 22And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
<br>23Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 24And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said unto them: ‘Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with
<br> 
<br>you.’ 25But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah. 26And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
<br>27And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and
<br> 
<br>twentieth day of the month, that Evil- merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison. 28And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon. 29And he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life. 30And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.
<br> 
<br>ישעיה
<br>ISAIAH
<br> 
<br>The Vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
<br>Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<br>
<br>2Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
<br>For the LORD hath spoken:
<br>Children I have reared, and brought up,
<br>And they have rebelled against Me.
<br>3The ox knoweth his owner, And the ass his master’s crib; But Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider.
<br>
<br>4Ah sinful nation,
<br>A people laden with iniquity, A seed of evil-doers, Children that deal corruptly; They have forsaken the LORD,
<br>They have contemned the Holy One of
<br>Israel,
<br>They are turned away backward.
<br>5On what part will ye yet be stricken,
<br>Seeing ye stray away more and more?
<br>The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faint;
<br>6From the sole of the foot even unto the head
<br> 
<br>There is no soundness in it;
<br>But wounds, and bruises, and festering sores:
<br>They have not been pressed, neither bound up,
<br>Neither mollified with oil.
<br>7Your country is desolate;
<br>Your cities are burned with fire;
<br>Your land, strangers devour it in your presence,
<br>And it is desolate, as overthrown by floods.
<br>8And the daughter of Zion is left As a booth in a vineyard,
<br>As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,
<br>As a besieged city.
<br>9Except the LORD of hosts Had left unto us a very small
<br>remnant,
<br>We should have been as Sodom, We should have been like unto
<br>Gomorrah.
<br>
<br>10Hear the word of the LORD, Ye rulers of Sodom;
<br>Give ear unto the law of our God, Ye people of Gomorrah.
<br>11To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams,
<br>And the fat of fed beasts;
<br> 
<br>And I delight not in the blood
<br>Of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he- goats.
<br>12When ye come to appear before Me,
<br>Who hath required this at your hand, To trample My courts?
<br>13Bring no more vain oblations;
<br>It is an offering of abomination unto Me;
<br>New moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations—
<br>I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.
<br>14Your new moons and your appointed seasons
<br>My soul hateth;
<br>They are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.
<br>15And when ye spread forth your hands,
<br>I will hide Mine eyes from you; Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear;
<br>Your hands are full of blood. 16Wash you, make you clean, Put away the evil of your doings From before Mine eyes,
<br>Cease to do evil;
<br>17Learn to do well;
<br>Seek justice, relieve the oppressed,
<br>Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<br>
<br>18Come now, and let us reason together,
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>Though your sins be as scarlet, They shall be as white as snow;
<br> 
<br>Though they be red like crimson, They shall be as wool.
<br>19If ye be willing and obedient, Ye shall eat the good of the land; 20But if ye refuse and rebel,
<br>Ye shall be devoured with the sword;
<br>For the mouth of the LORD hath spoken.
<br>
<br>21How is the faithful city Become a harlot!
<br>She that was full of justice, Righteousness lodged in her, But now murderers.
<br>22Thy silver is become dross, Thy wine mixed with water. 23Thy princes are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Every one loveth bribes, And followeth after rewards;
<br>They judge not the fatherless,
<br>Neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
<br>
<br>24Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts,
<br>The Mighty One of Israel:
<br>Ah, I will ease Me of Mine adversaries,
<br>And avenge Me of Mine enemies;
<br>25And I will turn My hand upon thee,
<br>And purge away thy dross as with lye,
<br>And will take away all thine alloy;
<br>26And I will restore thy judges as at the first,
<br> 
<br>And thy counsellors as at the beginning;
<br>Afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness,
<br>The faithful city.
<br>27Zion shall be redeemed with justice,
<br>And they that return of her with righteousness.
<br>28But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together,
<br>And they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
<br>29For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have desired,
<br>And ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<br>30For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth,
<br>And as a garden that hath no water. 31And the strong shall be as tow, And his work as a spark;
<br>And they shall both burn together, And none shall quench them.
<br>
<br>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>2And it shall come to pass in the end of days,
<br>That the mountain of the LORD’S house
<br>Shall be established as the top of the mountains,
<br>And shall be exalted above the hills; And all nations shall flow unto it.
<br> 
<br>3And many peoples shall go and say:
<br>‘Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,
<br>To the house of the God of Jacob; And He will teach us of His ways, And we will walk in His paths.’
<br>For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
<br>And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<br>4And He shall judge between the nations,
<br>And shall decide for many peoples;
<br>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
<br>And their spears into pruninghooks;
<br>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
<br>Neither shall they learn war any more.
<br>
<br>5O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk
<br>In the light of the LORD.
<br>6For Thou hast forsaken Thy people the house of Jacob;
<br>For they are replenished from the east,
<br>And with soothsayers like the Philistines,
<br>And they please themselves in the brood of aliens.
<br>7Their land also is full of silver and gold,
<br>Neither is there any end of their treasures;
<br>Their land also is full of horses,
<br> 
<br>Neither is there any end of their chariots.
<br>8Their land also is full of idols;
<br>Every one worshippeth the work of his own hands,
<br>That which his own fingers have made.
<br>9And man boweth down, And man lowereth himself;
<br>And Thou canst not bear with them.
<br>10Enter into the rock, And hide thee in the dust,
<br>From before the terror of the LORD, And from the glory of His majesty. 11The lofty looks of man shall be
<br>brought low,
<br>And the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,
<br>And the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<br>
<br>12For the LORD of hosts hath a day Upon all that is proud and lofty,
<br>And upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low;
<br>13And upon all the cedars of Lebanon
<br>That are high and lifted up,
<br>And upon all the oaks of Bashan;
<br>14And upon all the high mountains, And upon all the hills that are lifted up; 15And upon every lofty tower,
<br>And upon every fortified wall; 16And upon all the ships of Tarshish, And upon all delightful imagery.
<br>17And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
<br>And the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
<br> 
<br>And the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<br>
<br>18And the idols shall utterly pass away.
<br>19And men shall go into the caves of the rocks,
<br>And into the holes of the earth, From before the terror of the LORD, And from the glory of His majesty,
<br>When He ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
<br>20In that day a man shall cast away His idols of silver, and his idols of
<br>gold,
<br>Which they made for themselves to worship,
<br>To the moles and to the bats;
<br>21To go into the clefts of the rocks, And into the crevices of the crags, From before the terror of the LORD, And from the glory of His majesty,
<br>When he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
<br>
<br>22Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath;
<br>For how little is he to be accounted!
<br>
<br>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,
<br>Doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah
<br>Stay and staff,
<br>Every stay of bread, and every stay of water;
<br>2The mighty man, and the man of war;
<br>The judge, and the prophet,
<br> 
<br>And the diviner, and the elder;
<br>3The captain of fifty, and the man of rank,
<br>And the counsellor, and the cunning charmer, and the skilful enchanter.
<br>4And I will give children to be their princes,
<br>And babes shall rule over them.
<br>5And the people shall oppress one another,
<br>Every man his fellow, and every man his neighbour;
<br>The child shall behave insolently against the aged,
<br>And the base against the honourable,
<br>6For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father:
<br>‘Thou hast a mantle, Be thou our ruler,
<br>And let this ruin be under thy hand.’ 7In that day shall he swear, saying: ‘I will not be a healer;
<br>For in my house is neither bread nor a mantle;
<br>Ye shall not make me ruler of a people.’
<br>8For Jerusalem is ruined, And Judah is fallen;
<br>Because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD,
<br>To provoke the eyes of His glory.
<br>
<br>9The show of their countenance doth witness against them;
<br>And they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not.
<br>Woe unto their soul!
<br> 
<br>For they have wrought evil unto themselves.
<br>10Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him;
<br>For they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<br>11Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him;
<br>For the work of his hands shall be done to him.
<br>12As for My people, a babe is their master,
<br>And women rule over them.
<br>O My people, they that lead thee cause thee to err,
<br>And destroy the way of thy paths.
<br>
<br>13The LORD standeth up to plead, And standeth to judge the peoples. 14The LORD will enter into judgment With the elders of His people, and
<br>the princes thereof:
<br>‘It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; The spoil of the poor is in your houses;
<br>15What mean ye that ye crush My people,
<br>And grind the face of the poor?’ Saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts. 16Moreover the LORD said:
<br>Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
<br>And walk with stretched-forth necks And wanton eyes,
<br>Walking and mincing as they go,
<br>And making a tinkling with their feet;
<br>17Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab
<br> 
<br>The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,
<br>And the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.
<br>18In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their anklets, and the fillets, and the crescents; 19the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils; 20the headtires, and the armlets, and the sashes, and the corselets, and the amulets; 21the rings, and the nose- jewels; 22the aprons, and the mantelets, and the cloaks, and the girdles; 23and the gauze robes, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the mantles. 24And it shall come to pass, that
<br>Instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness;
<br>And instead of a girdle rags;
<br>And instead of curled hair baldness;
<br>And instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
<br>Branding instead of beauty.
<br>25Thy men shall fall by the sword, And thy mighty in the war.
<br>26And her gates shall lament and mourn;
<br>And utterly bereft she shall sit upon the ground.
<br>
<br>And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying: ‘We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our
<br>reproach.’
<br>2In that day shall the growth of the LORD be beautiful and glorious,
<br> 
<br>And the fruit of the land excellent and comely
<br>For them that are escaped of Israel.
<br>3And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem; 4when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction. 5And the LORD will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy. 6And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
<br>
<br>Let me sing of my well-beloved,
<br>A song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
<br>My well-beloved had a vineyard In a very fruitful hill;
<br>2And he digged it, and cleared it of stones,
<br>And planted it with the choicest vine,
<br>And built a tower in the midst of it, And also hewed out a vat therein;
<br>And he looked that it should bring forth grapes,
<br>And it brought forth wild grapes.
<br> 
<br>3And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
<br>Judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
<br>4What could have been done more to my vineyard,
<br>That I have not done in it?
<br>Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
<br>Brought it forth wild grapes?
<br>
<br>5And now come, I will tell you What I will do to my vineyard:
<br>I will take away the hedge thereof, And it shall be eaten up;
<br>I will break down the fence thereof, And it shall be trodden down;
<br>6And I will lay it waste:
<br>It shall not be pruned nor hoed,
<br>But there shall come up briers and thorns;
<br>I will also command the clouds That they rain no rain upon it.
<br>
<br>7For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
<br>And the men of Judah the plant of His delight;
<br>And He looked for justice, but behold violence;
<br>For righteousness, but behold a cry.
<br>
<br>8Woe unto them that join house to house,
<br>That lay field to field,
<br>Till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell
<br>Alone in the midst of the land!
<br>9In mine ears said the LORD of hosts:
<br> 
<br>Of a truth many houses shall be desolate,
<br>Even great and fair, without inhabitant.
<br>10For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,
<br>And the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
<br>
<br>11Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning,
<br>That they may follow strong drink; That tarry late into the night,
<br>Till wine inflame them!
<br>12And the harp and the psaltery, the tabret and the pipe,
<br>And wine, are in their feasts;
<br>But they regard not the work of the LORD,
<br>Neither have they considered the operation of His hands.
<br>13Therefore My people are gone into captivity,
<br>For want of knowledge;
<br>And their honourable men are famished,
<br>And their multitude are parched with thirst.
<br>14Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire,
<br>And opened her mouth without measure;
<br>And down goeth their glory, and their tumult, and their uproar,
<br>And he that rejoiceth among them.
<br>15And man is bowed down, And man is humbled,
<br>And the eyes of the lofty are humbled;
<br> 
<br>16But the LORD of hosts is exalted through justice,
<br>And God the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness.
<br>17Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture,
<br>And the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.
<br>
<br>18Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
<br>And sin as it were with a cart rope,
<br>19That say: ‘Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work,
<br>That we may see it;
<br>And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come,
<br>That we may know it! ’
<br>
<br>20Woe unto them that call evil good, And good evil;
<br>That change darkness into light, And light into darkness;
<br>That change bitter into sweet, And sweet into bitter!
<br>
<br>21Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes,
<br>And prudent in their own sight!
<br>
<br>22Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine,
<br>And men of strength to mingle strong drink;
<br>23That justify the wicked for a reward,
<br>And take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
<br> 
<br>24Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble,
<br>And as the chaff is consumed in the flame,
<br>So their root shall be as rottenness,
<br>And their blossom shall go up as dust;
<br>Because they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts,
<br>And contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<br>25Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against His people,
<br>And He hath stretched forth His hand against them, and hath smitten them,
<br>And the hills did tremble,
<br>And their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets.
<br>For all this His anger is not turned away,
<br>But His hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<br>26And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far,
<br>And will hiss unto them from the end of the earth;
<br>And, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly;
<br>27None shall be weary nor stumble among them;
<br>None shall slumber nor sleep;
<br>Neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
<br>Nor the latchet of their shoes be broken; 28Whose arrows are sharp,
<br>And all their bows bent;
<br> 
<br>Their horses’hoofs shall be counted like flint,
<br>And their wheels like a whirlwind; 29Their roaring shall be like a lion, They shall roar like young lions,
<br>yea, they shall roar,
<br>And lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe,
<br>And there shall be none to deliver.
<br>30And they shall roar against them in that day
<br>Like the roaring of the sea; And if one look unto the land, Behold darkness and distress,
<br>And the light is darkened in the skies thereof.
<br>
<br>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. 2Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 3And one called
<br>unto another, and said:
<br>Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts;
<br>The whole earth is full of His glory.
<br>4And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke. 5Then said I:
<br>Woe is me! for I am undone; Because I am a man of unclean lips,
<br>And I dwell in the midst of a people of
<br>unclean lips;
<br>For mine eyes have seen the King,
<br> 
<br>The LORD of hosts.
<br>6Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; 7and he touched my mouth with it, and said:
<br>Lo, this hath touched thy lips; And thine iniquity is taken away, And thy sin expiated.
<br>8And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:
<br>Whom shall I send,
<br>And who will go for us?
<br>Then I said: ‘Here am I; send me.’ 9And He said: ‘Go, and tell this people:
<br>Hear ye indeed, but understand not; And see ye indeed, but perceive not. 10Make the heart of this people fat, And make their ears heavy,
<br>And shut their eyes;
<br>Lest they, seeing with their eyes, And hearing with their ears,
<br>And understanding with their heart, Rreturn, and be healed.’
<br>11Then said I: ‘Lord, how long?’ And He answered:
<br>‘Until cities be waste without inhabitant,
<br>And houses without man,
<br>And the land become utterly waste,
<br>12And the LORD have removed men far away,
<br>And the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
<br>13And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth,
<br> 
<br>when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.’
<br>
<br>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
<br>of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it; but could not prevail against it. 2And it was told the house of David, saying: ‘Aram is confederate with Ephraim.’ And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind.
<br>3Then said the LORD unto Isaiah: ‘Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and aShear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers’field; 4and say unto him: Keep calm, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah. 5Because Aram hath counselled evil against thee, Ephraim also, and the son of Remaliah, saying: 6Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel; 7thus saith the Lord GOD:
<br>It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
<br>8For the head of Aram is Damascus, And the head of Damascus is Rezin;
<br> 
<br>And within threescore and five years
<br>Shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people;
<br>9And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,
<br>And the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.
<br>If ye will not have faith, surely ye shall not be established.’
<br>
<br>10And the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying: 11’Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God: ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.’ 12But Ahaz said: ‘I will not ask, neither will I try the LORD.’ 13And he said: ‘Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also? 14Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name bImmanuel. 15Curd and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 16Yea, before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou hast a horror of shall be forsaken. 17The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.’
<br>18And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a That is, A remnant shall return.	b That is, God is with us.
<br> 
<br>That the LORD shall hiss for the fly That is in the uttermost part of the
<br>rivers of Egypt,
<br>And for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
<br>19And they shall come, and shall rest all of them
<br>In the rugged valleys, and in the holes of the rocks,
<br>And upon all thorns, and upon all brambles.
<br>20In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard.
<br>21And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep; 22and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat curd; for curd and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.
<br>23And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall even be for briers and thorns. 24With arrows and with bow shall one come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. 25And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.
<br>
<br>And the LORD said unto me: ‘Take thee a great tablet, and write upon
<br> 
<br>it in common script: The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth; 2and I will take unto Me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.’ 3And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD unto me: ‘Call his name aMaher-shalal-hashbaz. 4For before the child shall have knowledge to cry: My father, and: My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.’
<br>5And the LORD spoke unto me yet again, saying:
<br>6Forasmuch as this people hath refused
<br>The waters of Shiloah that go softly, And rejoiceth with Rezin and
<br>Remaliah’s son;
<br>7Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them
<br>The waters of the River, mighty and many,
<br>Even the king of Assyria and all his glory;
<br>And he shall come up over all his channels,
<br>And go over all his banks;
<br>8And he shall sweep through Judah Overflowing as he passeth through He shall reach even to the neck; And the stretching out of his wings Shall fill the breadth of thy land, O
<br>Immanuel.
<br>
<br>a That is, The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth.
<br> 
<br>
<br>9Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
<br>And give ear, all ye of far countries;
<br>Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
<br>Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
<br>10Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought;
<br>Speak the word, and it shall not stand;
<br>For God is with us.
<br>11For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, admonishing me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: 12’Say ye not: A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people do say: A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor account it dreadful. 13The LORD of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. 14And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 15And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.’
<br>16’Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction among My disciples.’ 17And I will wait for the LORD, that hideth His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for Him. 18Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me shall be for signs and for wonders in Israel from the
<br> 
<br>LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. 19And when they shall say unto you: ‘Seek unto the ghosts and the familiar spirits, that chirp and that mutter; should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living unto the dead 20for instruction and for testimony?’—Surely they will speak according to this word, wherein there is no light.— 21And they shall pass this way that are sore bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and, whether they turn their faces upward, 22or look unto the earth, behold distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness. 23For is there no gloom to her that was stedfast? Now the former hath lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but the latter hath dealt a more grievous blow by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in the district of the nations.
<br>
<br>The	people	that	walked	in darkness Have seen a great light;
<br>They that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death,
<br>Upon them hath the light shined. 2Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast increased their joy;
<br>They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest,
<br>As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
<br>3For the yoke of his burden, And the staff of his shoulder,
<br> 
<br>The rod of his oppressor,
<br>Thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.
<br>For every boot stamped with fierceness,
<br>And every cloak rolled in blood,
<br>Shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire.
<br>5For a child is born unto us, A son is given unto us;
<br>And the government is upon his shoulder;
<br>And his name is called
<br>aPele-joez-el-gibbor-
<br>Abi-ad-sar-shalom;
<br>6That the government may be increased, And of peace there be no end,
<br>Upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom,
<br>To establish it, and to uphold it Through justice and through
<br>righteousness From henceforth even for ever.
<br>The zeal of the LORD of hosts doth perform this.
<br>
<br>7The Lord sent a word into Jacob, And it hath lighted upon Israel.
<br>8And all the people shall know, Even Ephraim and the inhabitant of
<br>Samaria,
<br>That say in pride and in arrogancy of heart:
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, Wonderful in counsel is God, the Mighty, the Everlasting Father, the Ruler of peace.
<br> 
<br>9‘The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones;
<br>The sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.’
<br>10Therefore the LORD doth set upon high the adversaries of Rezin against him,
<br>And spur his enemies;
<br>11The Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west;
<br>And they devour Israel with open mouth.
<br>For all this His anger is not turned away,
<br>But His hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<br>12Yet the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth them,
<br>Neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.
<br>13Therefore the LORD doth cut off from Israel head and tail,
<br>Palm-branch and rush, in one day.
<br>14The elder and the man of rank, he is the head;
<br>And the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
<br>15For they that lead this people cause them to err;
<br>And they that are led of them are destroyed.
<br>16Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,
<br>Neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
<br>For every one is ungodly and an evil-doer,
<br>And every mouth speaketh wantonness.
<br> 
<br>For all this His anger is not turned away,
<br>But His hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<br>17 For wickedness burneth as the fire;
<br>It devoureth the briers and thorns;
<br>Yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest,
<br>And they roll upward in thick clouds of smoke.
<br>18Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land burnt up;
<br>The people also are as the fuel of fire;
<br>No man spareth his brother.
<br>19And one snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry;
<br>And he eateth on the left hand, and is not satisfied;
<br>They eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
<br>20Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh;
<br>And they together are against Judah.
<br>For all this His anger is not turned away,
<br>But His hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<br>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,
<br>And to the writers that write iniquity;
<br>2To turn aside the needy from judgment,
<br>And to take away the right of the poor of My people,
<br>That widows may be their spoil,
<br> 
<br>And that they may make the fatherless their prey!
<br>3And what will ye do in the day of visitation,
<br>And in the ruin which shall come from far?
<br>To whom will ye flee for help?
<br>And where will ye leave your glory?
<br>4They can do nought except crouch under the captives,
<br>And fall under the slain.
<br>For all this His anger is not turned away,
<br>But His hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<br>5O Asshur, the rod of Mine anger,
<br>In whose hand as a staff is Mine indignation!
<br>6I do send him against an ungodly nation, And against the people of My wrath do I give him a charge,
<br>To take the spoil, and to take the prey,
<br>And to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
<br>7Howbeit he meaneth not so, Neither doth his heart think so; But it is in his heart to destroy, And to cut off nations not a few.
<br>8For he saith: ‘Are not my princes all of them kings?
<br>9Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad?
<br>Is not Samaria as Damascus?
<br>10As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols,
<br>Whose graven images did exceed them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
<br>11Shall I not, as I have done unto
<br> 
<br>Samaria and her idols,
<br>So do to Jerusalem and her idols?’ 12Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed His whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his haughty looks. 13For he hath said:
<br>By the strength of my hand I have done it,
<br>And by my wisdom, for I am prudent;
<br>In that I have removed the bounds of the peoples,
<br>And have robbed their treasures,
<br>And have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants;
<br>14And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples;
<br>And as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken,
<br>Have I gathered all the earth;
<br>And there was none that moved the wing, Or that opened mouth, or chirped.
<br>
<br>15Should the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
<br>Should the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it?
<br>As if a rod should move them that lift it up,
<br>Or as if a staff should lift up him that is not wood.
<br>16Therefore will the Lord, the LORD of hosts,
<br>Send among his fat ones leanness;
<br> 
<br>And under his glory there shall be kindled
<br>A burning like the burning of fire.
<br>17And the light of Israel shall be for a fire,
<br>And his Holy One for a flame;
<br>And it shall burn and devour his thorns
<br>And his briers in one day.
<br>18And the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field,
<br>He will consume both soul and body;
<br>And it shall be as when a sick man wasteth away.
<br>19And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
<br>That a child may write them down.
<br>
<br>20And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the remnant of Israel,
<br>And they that are escaped of the house of Jacob,
<br>Shall no more again stay upon him that smote them;
<br>But shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
<br>21 aA remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob,
<br>Unto God the Mighty.
<br>22For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea,
<br>Only a remnant of them shall return; An extermination is determined,
<br>overflowing with righteousness.
<br>
<br>
<br>a Heb. shear jashub.
<br> 
<br>23For an extermination wholly determined
<br>Shall the Lord, the GOD of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.
<br>
<br>24Therefore thus saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts: O My people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of Asshur, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. 25For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and Mine anger shall be to their destruction. 26And the LORD of hosts shall stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb; and as His rod was over the sea, so shall He lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 27And it shall come to pass in that day, that
<br>His burden shall depart from off thy shoulder,
<br>And his yoke from off thy neck,
<br>And the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.
<br>28He is come to Aiath,
<br>He is passed through Migron;
<br>At Michmas he layeth up his baggage;
<br>29They are gone over the pass; They have taken up their lodging at
<br>Geba; Ramah trembleth; Gibeath-shaul is fled.
<br>30Cry thou with a shrill voice, O daughter of Gallim!
<br>Hearken, O Laish! O thou poor Anathoth!
<br>31Madmenah is in mad flight;
<br> 
<br>The inhabitants of Gebim flee to cover.
<br>32This very day shall he halt at Nob,
<br>Shaking his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion,
<br>The hill of Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>33Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,
<br>Shall lop the boughs with terror;
<br>And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down,
<br>And the lofty shall be laid low. 34And He shall cut down the
<br>thickets of the forest with iron,
<br>And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
<br>
<br>And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse,
<br>And a twig shall grow forth out of his roots.
<br>2And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,
<br>The spirit of wisdom and understanding,
<br>The spirit of counsel and might,
<br>The spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.
<br>3And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD;
<br>And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
<br>Neither decide after the hearing of his ears;
<br>4But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
<br> 
<br>And decide with equity for the meek of the land;
<br>And he shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth,
<br>And with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
<br>5And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,
<br>And faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
<br>6And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
<br>And the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
<br>And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
<br>And a little child shall lead them.
<br>7And the cow and the bear feed;
<br>Their young ones shall lie down together;
<br>And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
<br>8And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,
<br>And the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk’s den.
<br>9They shall not hurt nor destroy In all My holy mountain;
<br>For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD,
<br>As the waters cover the sea.
<br>
<br>10And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the root of Jesse, that standeth for an ensign of the peoples,
<br>Unto him shall the nations seek;
<br>And his resting-place shall be glorious.
<br> 
<br>
<br>11And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the Lord will set His hand again the second time
<br>To recover the remnant of His people,
<br>That shall remain from Assyria, and from Egypt,
<br>And from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam,
<br>And from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
<br>12And He will set up an ensign for the nations,
<br>And will assemble the dispersed of Israel,
<br>And gather together the scattered of Judah
<br>From the four corners of the earth.
<br>13The envy also of Ephraim shall depart,
<br>And they that harass Judah shall be cut off;
<br>Ephraim shall not envy Judah, And Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 14And they shall fly down upon the
<br>shoulder of the Philistines on the west;
<br>Together shall they spoil the children of the east;
<br>They shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab;
<br>And the children of Ammon shall obey them.
<br>15And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
<br> 
<br>And with His scorching wind will He shake His hand over the River,
<br>And will smite it into seven streams, And cause men to march over dry-
<br> 
<br>6Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion,
<br>For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.’
<br> 
<br>shod.
<br>16And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people,
<br>That shall remain from Assyria,
<br> 
<br>13
<br>see.
<br> 
<br>The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did
<br> 
<br>Like as there was for Israel
<br>In the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>And in that day thou shalt say: ‘I will give thanks unto Thee,
<br>O LORD;
<br>For though Thou was angry with me,
<br>Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me.
<br>2Behold, God is my salvation;
<br>I will trust, and will not be afraid;
<br>For GOD the LORD is my strength and song;
<br>And He is become my salvation.’
<br>3Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
<br>Out of the wells of salvation. 4And in that day shall ye say: ‘Give thanks unto the LORD,
<br>proclaim His name,
<br>Declare His doings among the peoples,
<br>Make mention that His name is exalted.
<br>5Sing unto the LORD; for He hath done gloriously;
<br>This is made known in all the earth.
<br> 
<br>2Set ye up an ensign upon the high mountain,
<br>Lift up the voice unto them, Wave the hand, that they may go Into the gates of the nobles.
<br>3I have commanded My consecrated ones,
<br>Yea, I have called My mighty ones for mine anger,
<br>Even My proudly exulting ones. 4Hark, a tumult in the mountains, Like as of a great people!
<br>Hark, the uproar of the kingdoms Of the nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts mustereth
<br>The host of the battle.
<br>
<br>5They come from a far country, From the end of heaven,
<br>Even the LORD, and the weapons of His indignation,
<br>To destroy the whole earth.
<br>6Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand;
<br>As destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
<br>7Therefore shall all hands be slack, And every heart of man shall melt. 8And they shall be affrighted;
<br> 
<br>Pangs and throes shall take hold of them;
<br>They shall be in pain as a woman in travail;
<br>They shall look aghast one at another;
<br>Their faces shall be faces of flame.
<br>
<br>9Behold, the day of the LORD cometh,
<br>Cruel, and full of wrath and fierce anger;
<br>To make the earth a desolation,
<br>And to destroy the sinners thereof out of it,
<br>10For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof
<br>Shall not give their light;
<br>The sun shall be darkened in his going forth,
<br>And the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
<br>11And I will visit upon the world their evil,
<br>And upon the wicked their iniquity;
<br>And I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
<br>And will lay low the haughtiness of the tyrants.
<br>12I will make man more rare than fine gold,
<br>Even man than the pure gold of Ophir.
<br>
<br>13Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble,
<br>And the earth shall be shaken out of her place,
<br>For the wrath of the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>And for the day of His fierce anger.
<br>14And it shall come to pass, that as the chased gazelle,
<br>And as sheep that no man gathereth,
<br>They shall turn every man to his own people,
<br>And shall flee every man to his own land.
<br>15Every one that is found shall be thrust through;
<br>And every one that is caught shall fall by the sword.
<br>16Their babes also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes;
<br>Their houses shall be spoiled, And their wives ravished.
<br>
<br>17Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,
<br>Who shall not regard silver,
<br>And as for gold, they shall not delight in it.
<br>18And their bows shall dash the young men in pieces;
<br>And they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb;
<br>Their eye shall not spare children.
<br>19And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
<br>The beauty of the Chaldeans’pride, Shall be as when God overthrew
<br>Sodom and Gomorrah.
<br>
<br>20It shall never be inhabited,
<br>Neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation;
<br>Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there;
<br> 
<br>Neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
<br>21But wild-cats shall lie there;
<br>And their houses shall be full of ferrets;
<br>And ostriches shall dwell there, And satyrs shall dance there.
<br>22And jackals shall howl in their castles,
<br>And wild-dogs in the pleasant palaces;
<br>And her time is near to come,
<br>And her days shall not be prolonged.
<br>
<br>For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and will
<br>yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land; and the stranger shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 2And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and for handmaids; and they shall take them captive, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
<br>3And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy travail, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve, 4that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say:
<br>How hath the oppressor ceased! The exactress of gold ceased!
<br>5The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked,
<br> 
<br>The sceptre of the rulers,
<br>6That smote the peoples in wrath With an incessant stroke,
<br>That ruled the nations in anger,
<br>With a persecution that none restrained.
<br>7The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet;
<br>They break forth into singing. 8Yea, the cypresses rejoice at thee, And the cedars of Lebanon:
<br>‘Since thou art laid down,
<br>No feller is come up against us.’
<br>
<br>9The nether-world from beneath is moved for thee
<br>To meet thee at thy coming;
<br>The shades are stirred up for thee, Even all the chief ones of the earth; All the kings of the nations
<br>Are raised up from their thrones.
<br>10All they do answer And say unto thee:
<br>‘Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?
<br>11Thy pomp is brought down to the nether-world,
<br>And the noise of thy psalteries; The maggot is spread under thee, And the worms cover thee.’
<br>
<br>12How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning!
<br>How art thou cut down to the ground,
<br>That didst cast lots over the nations!
<br>13And thou saidst in thy heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, Above the stars of God
<br> 
<br>Will I exalt my throne,
<br>And I will sit upon the mount of meeting,
<br>In the uttermost parts of the north;
<br>14I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
<br>I will be like the Most High.’
<br>15Yet thou shalt be brought down to the nether-world,
<br>To the uttermost parts of the pit.
<br>
<br>16They that saw thee do narrowly look upon thee,
<br>They gaze earnestly at thee:
<br>‘Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
<br>That did shake kingdoms;
<br>17That made the world as a wilderness,
<br>And destroyed the cities thereof;
<br>That opened not the house of his prisoners?’
<br>18All the kings of the nations, All of them, sleep in glory, Every one in his own house.
<br>19But thou art cast forth away from thy grave
<br>Like an abhorred offshoot,
