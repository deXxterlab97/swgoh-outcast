<br>(f) Central registration requirements; regulation of brokers and dealers; electronic registration
<br>
<br>(1) The Administration shall—

The Administrator may require that such payment be made as a single payment or as a series of payments.

<br>§697f. Prepayment of development company debentures
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Prepayment authorized
<br>
<br>Subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (b), an issuer of a debenture purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter may, at the election of the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) and with the approval of the Administration, prepay such debenture in accordance with the provisions of this section.
<br>(2) Procedure
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In making a prepayment under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.
<br>(B) Repurchase premium
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the repurchase premium is the amount equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(I) the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture on the date of prepayment; and
<br>
<br>(II) the applicable percentage rate, as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).
<br>(ii) Applicable percentage rate
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (i)(II), the applicable percentage rate means—
<br>
<br>(I) with respect to a 10-year term loan, 8.5 percent;
<br>
<br>(II) with respect to a 15-year term loan, 9.5 percent;
<br>
<br>(III) with respect to a 20-year term loan, 10.5 percent; and
<br>
<br>(IV) with respect to a 25-year term loan, 11.5 percent.
<br>(iii) Adjustments to applicable percentage rate
<br>
<br>The percentage rates described in clause (ii) shall be increased or decreased by the Administration by a factor not to exceed one-third, if the same factor is applied in each case and if the Administration determines that an adjustment is necessary, based on the number of borrowers having given notice of their intent to participate, in order to make the program (including the amounts appropriated for this purpose under Public Law 103–317) result in no substantial net gain or loss of revenue to the Federal Financing Bank or to the Administration. Amounts collected in excess of the amount necessary to ensure revenue neutrality shall be refunded to the borrowers.
<br>(b) Requirements
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a), the requirements of this subsection are that—
<br>
<br>(1) the debenture is outstanding and neither the loan that secures the debenture, if any, nor the debenture is in default on the date on which the prepayment is made;
<br>
<br>(2) State, local, or personal funds, or the proceeds of a refinancing in accordance with subsection (d) under the programs authorized by this subchapter, are used to prepay or roll over the debenture; and
<br>
<br>(3) with respect to a debenture issued under section 697 of this title, the issuer certifies that the benefits, net of fees and expenses authorized herein, associated with prepayment of the debenture are entirely passed through to the borrower.
<br>(c) No prepayment fees or penalties
<br>
<br>No fees or penalties other than those specified in this section may be imposed on the issuer, the borrower, the Administration, or any fund or account administered by the Administration as the result of a prepayment under this section.
<br>(d) Refinancing limitations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The refinancing of a debenture under sections 697a and 697b of this title, in accordance with subsection (b)(2)—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not exceed the amount necessary to prepay existing debentures, including all costs associated with the refinancing and any applicable prepayment penalty or repurchase premium; and
<br>
<br>(B) except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), shall be subject to the provisions of sections 697a and 697b of this title and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including rules and regulations governing payment of authorized expenses, commissions, fees, and discounts to brokers and dealers in trust certificates issued pursuant to section 697b of this title.
<br>(2) Job creation
<br>
<br>An applicant for refinancing under section 697a of this title of a loan made pursuant to section 697 of this title shall not be required to demonstrate that a requisite number of jobs will be created with the proceeds of a refinancing.
<br>(3) Loan processing fee
<br>
<br>To cover the cost of loan packaging, processing, and other administrative functions, a development company that provides refinancing under subsection (b)(2) may impose a one-time loan processing fee, not to exceed 0.5 percent of the principal amount of the loan.
<br>(4) New debentures
<br>
<br>Issuers of debentures under subchapter III may issue new debentures in accordance with such subchapter in order to prepay existing debentures as authorized in this section.
<br>(5) Preliminary notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Administration shall use certified mail and other reasonable means to notify each eligible borrower of the prepayment program provided in this subchapter. Each preliminary notice shall specify the range and dollar amount of repurchase premiums which could be required of that borrower in order to participate in the program. In carrying out this program, the Administration shall provide a period of not less than 45 days following the receipt of such notice by the borrower during which the borrower must notify the Administration of the borrower's intent to participate in the program. The Administration shall require that a borrower who gives notice of its intent to participate to make an earnest money deposit of $1,000 which shall not be refundable but which shall be credited toward the final repurchase premium.
<br>(B) "Borrower" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "borrower", in the case of a small business investment company or a specialized small business investment company, means "issuer".
<br>(6) Final notice
<br>
<br>Based upon the response to the preliminary notice under paragraph (5), the Administration shall make a final computation of the necessary prepayment premiums and shall notify each qualified respondent of the results of such computation. Each qualified respondent shall be afforded not less than 4 months to complete the prepayment.
<br>(e) Definitions
