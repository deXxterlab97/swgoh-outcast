<br>Job Evaluation Policy Act of 1970
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 91–216, May 17, 1970, 84 Stat. 72, provided: "That this Act may be cited as the 'Job Evaluation Policy Act of 1970'.
<br>"Title I—Congressional Findings With Respect to Job Evaluation and Ranking in the Executive Branch
<br>
<br>"Sec. 101. The Congress hereby finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the tremendous growth required in the activities of the Federal Government in order to meet the country's needs during the past several decades has led to the need for employees in an ever-increasing and changing variety of occupations and professions, many of which did not exist when the basic principles of job evaluation and ranking were established by the Classification Act of 1923 [Act Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488]. The diverse and constantly changing nature of these occupations and professions requires that the Federal Government reassess its approach to job evaluation and ranking better to fulfill its role as an employer and assure efficient economical administration;
<br>
<br>"(2) the large number and variety of job evaluation and ranking systems in the executive branch have resulted in significant inequities in selection, promotion, and pay of employees in comparable positions among these systems;
<br>
<br>"(3) little effort has been made by Congress or the executive branch to consolidate or coordinate the various job evaluation and ranking systems, and there has been no progress toward the establishment of a coordinated system in which job evaluation and ranking, regardless of the methods used, is related to a unified set of principles providing coherence and equity throughout the executive branch;
<br>
<br>"(4) within the executive branch, there has been no significant study of, or experimentation with the several recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking to determine which of those methods are most appropriate for use and application to meet the present and future needs of the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>"(5) notwithstanding the recommendations resulting from the various studies conducted during the last twenty years, the Federal Government has not taken the initiative to implement those recommendations with respect to the job evaluation and ranking systems within the executive branch, with the result that such systems have not, in many cases, been adapted or administered to meet the rapidly changing needs of the Federal Government.
<br>"Title II—Statement of Policy
<br>
<br>"Sec. 201. It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the executive branch shall, in the interest of equity, efficiency, and good administration, operate under a coordinated job evaluation and ranking system for all civilian positions, to the greatest extent practicable;
<br>
<br>"(2) the system shall be designed so as to utilize such methods of job evaluation and ranking as are appropriate for use in the executive branch, taking into account the various occupational categories of positions therein; and
<br>
<br>"(3) the United States Civil Service Commission shall be authorized to exercise general supervision and control over such a system.
<br>"Title III—Preparation of a Job Evaluation and Ranking Plan By the Civil Service Commission and Reports and Recommendations to Congress
<br>
<br>"Sec. 301. The Civil Service Commission, through such organizational unit which it shall establish within the Commission and which shall report directly to the Commission, shall prepare a comprehensive plan for the establishment of a coordinated system of job evaluation and ranking for civilian positions, in the executive branch. The plan shall include, among other things—
<br>
<br>"(1) provision for the establishment of a method or methods for evaluating jobs and alining them by level;
<br>
<br>"(2) a time schedule for the conversion of existing job evaluation and ranking systems into the coordinated system;
<br>
<br>"(3) provision that the Civil Service Commission shall have general supervision of and control over the coordinated job evaluation and ranking system, including, if the Commission deems it appropriate, the authority to approve or disapprove the adoption, use and administration in the executive branch of the method or methods established under that system;
<br>
<br>"(4) provision for the establishment of procedures for the periodic review by the Civil Service Commission of the effectiveness of the method or methods adopted for use under the system; and
<br>
<br>"(5) provision for maintenance of the system to meet the changing needs of the executive branch in the future.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 302. In carrying out its functions under section 301 of this Act, the Commission shall consider all recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 303. The Civil Service Commission is authorized to secure directly from any executive agency, as defined by section 105 of title 5, United States Code, or any bureau, office, or part thereof, information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance for the purposes of this Act; and each such executive agency or bureau, office, or part thereof is authorized and directed to furnish such information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance directly to the Civil Service Commission upon request by the Commission.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 304. (a) Within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the President and the Congress an interim progress report on the current status and results of its activities under this Act, together with its current findings.
<br>
<br>"(b) Within two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 17, 1970]—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Civil Service Commission shall complete its functions under this Act and shall transmit to the President a comprehensive report of the result of its activities, together with its recommendations (including its draft of proposed legislation to carry out such recommendations), and
<br>
<br>"(2) the President shall transmit that report (including the recommendations and draft of proposed legislation of the Commission) to the Congress, together with such recommendations as the President deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(c) The Commission shall submit to the Committees on Post Office and Civil Service of the Senate and House of Representatives once each calendar month, or at such other intervals as may be directed by those committees, or either of them, an interim progress report on the then current status and results of the activities of the Commission under this Act, together with the then current findings of the Commission.
<br>
<br>"(d) The Commission shall periodically consult with, and solicit the views of, appropriate employee and professional organizations.
<br>
<br>"(e) The organizational unit established under section 301 of this Act shall cease to exist upon the submission of the report to the Congress under subsection (b) of this section."
<br>§5105. Standards for classification of positions
<br>
<br>(a) The Office of Personnel Management, after consulting the agencies, shall prepare standards for placing positions in their proper classes and grades. The Office may make such inquiries or investigations of the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of positions as it considers necessary for this purpose. The agencies, on request of the Office, shall furnish information for and cooperate in the preparation of the standards. In the standards, which shall be published in such form as the Office may determine, the Office shall—
<br>
<br>(1) define the various classes of positions in terms of duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements;
<br>
<br>(2) establish the official class titles; and
<br>
<br>(3) set forth the grades in which the classes have been placed by the Office.
<br>
<br>(b) The Office, after consulting the agencies to the extent considered necessary, shall revise, supplement, or abolish existing standards, or prepare new standards, so that, as nearly as may be practicable, positions existing at any given time will be covered by current published standards.
<br>
<br>(c) The official class titles established under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be used for personnel, budget, and fiscal purposes.

<br>Pub. L. 111–352, §12, Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3882, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Performance Management Skills and Competencies.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 4, 2011], the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the Performance Improvement Council, shall identify the key skills and competencies needed by Federal Government personnel for developing goals, evaluating programs, and analyzing and using performance information for the purpose of improving Government efficiency and effectiveness.
<br>
<br>"(b) Position Classifications.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, based on the identifications under subsection (a), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall incorporate, as appropriate, such key skills and competencies into relevant position classifications.

<br>§5106. Basis for classifying positions
<br>
<br>(a) Each position shall be placed in its appropriate class. The basis for determining the appropriate class is the duties and responsibilities of the position and the qualifications required by the duties and responsibilities.

These factors may be given effect only to the extent warranted by the work load of the organization unit and then only in combination with other factors, such as the kind, difficulty, and complexity of work supervised, the degree and scope of responsibility delegated to the supervisor, and the kind, degree, and character of the supervision exercised.
