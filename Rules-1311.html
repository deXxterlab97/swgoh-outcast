<br>
<br>(B) At the request of any individual who has entered into a contract referred to in subparagraph (A) and who receives a degree in medicine (including osteopathic or allopathic medicine), dentistry, optometry, podiatry, or pharmacy, the Secretary shall defer the active duty service obligation of that individual under that contract, in order that such individual may complete any internship, residency, or other advanced clinical training that is required for the practice of that health profession, for an appropriate period (in years, as determined by the Secretary), subject to the following conditions:
<br>
<br>(i) No period of internship, residency, or other advanced clinical training shall be counted as satisfying any period of obligated service that is required under this section.

<br>
<br>(ii) serves the tribe in which the recipient is enrolled.
<br>
<br>(D) Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary, in making assignments of Indian Health Scholarship recipients required to meet the active duty service obligation described in subparagraph (A), shall give priority to assigning individuals to service in those programs specified in subparagraph (A) that have a need for health professionals to provide health care services as a result of individuals having breached contracts entered into under this section.
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of an individual receiving a scholarship under this section who is enrolled part time in an approved course of study—
<br>
<br>(A) such scholarship shall be for a period of years not to exceed the part-time equivalent of 4 years, as determined by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(B) the period of obligated service described in paragraph (3)(A) shall be equal to the greater of—

<br>(i) the part-time equivalent of one year for each year for which the individual was provided a scholarship (as determined by the Secretary); or
<br>
<br>(ii) two years; and
<br>
<br>(C) the amount of the monthly stipend specified in section 254l(g)(1)(B) of title 42 shall be reduced pro rata (as determined by the Secretary) based on the number of hours such student is enrolled.

<br>
<br>in lieu of any service obligation arising under such contract, shall be liable to the United States for the amount which has been paid to him, or on his behalf, under the contract.

<br>
<br>(i) it is not possible for the recipient to meet that obligation or make that payment;

<br>
<br>(F) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to a recipient of an Indian Health Scholarship, no obligation for payment may be released by a discharge in bankruptcy under title 11, unless that discharge is granted after the expiration of the 5-year period beginning on the initial date on which that payment is due, and only if the bankruptcy court finds that the nondischarge of the obligation would be unconscionable.
<br>(c) Placement Office
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, acting through the Service, establish a Placement Office to develop and implement a national policy for the placement, to available vacancies within the Service, of Indian Health Scholarship recipients required to meet the active duty service obligation prescribed under section 254m of title 42 without regard to any competitive personnel system, agency personnel limitation, or Indian preference policy.
