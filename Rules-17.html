<br>8The LORD hath sworn by His right hand,
<br>And by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn To be food for thine enemies;
<br>And strangers shall not drink thy wine,
<br>For which thou hast laboured;
<br>9But they that have garnered it shall eat it,
<br>And praise the LORD,
<br>And they that have gathered it shall drink it
<br>In the courts of My sanctuary.
<br>
<br>10Go through, go through the gates,
<br> 
<br>Clear ye the way of the people; Cast up, cast up the highway, Gather out the stones;
<br>Lift up an ensign over the peoples. 11Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed Unto the end of the earth:
<br>Say ye to the daughter of Zion: ‘Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, His reward is with Him, And His recompense before Him.’ 12And they shall call them The holy
<br>people,
<br>The redeemed of the LORD;
<br>And thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
<br>
<br>’Who is this that cometh from Edom,
<br>With crimsoned garments from Bozrah?
<br>This that is glorious in his apparel,
<br>Stately in the greatness of his strength?’—
<br>’I that speak in victory, mighty to save.’—
<br>2’Wherefore is Thine apparel red,
<br>And Thy garments like his that treadeth in the winevat?’—
<br>3’I have trodden the winepress alone,
<br>And of the peoples there was no man with Me;
<br>Yea, I trod them in Mine anger, And trampled them in My fury;
<br>And their lifeblood is dashed against My garments,
<br>And I have stained all My raiment.
<br>4For the day of vengeance that was in My heart,
<br> 
<br>And My year of redemption are come.
<br>5And I looked, and there was none to help,
<br>And I beheld in astonishment, and there was none to uphold;
<br>Therefore Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me,
<br>And My fury, it upheld Me.
<br>6And I trod down the peoples in Mine anger,
<br>And made them drunk with My fury,
<br>And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.’
<br>
<br>7I will make mention of the mercies of the LORD,
<br>And the praises of the LORD,
<br>According to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us;
<br>And the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
<br>Which He hath bestowed on them according to His compassions,
<br>And according to the multitude of His mercies.
<br>8For He said: ‘Surely, they are My people,
<br>Children that will not deal falsely’; So He was their Saviour.
<br>9In all their affliction He was afflicted,
<br>And the angel of His presence saved them;
<br>In His love and in His pity He redeemed them;
<br>And He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
<br> 
<br>10But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit;
<br>Therefore He was turned to be their enemy,
<br>Himself fought against them.
<br>11Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses: ‘Where is He that brought them up
<br>out of the sea
<br>With the shepherds of His flock? Where is He that put His holy spirit In the midst of them?
<br>12That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses?
<br>That divided the water before them,
<br>To make Himself an everlasting name?
<br>13That led them through the deep, As a horse in the wilderness,
<br>without stumbling?
<br>14As the cattle that go down into the valley,
<br>The spirit of the LORD caused them to rest;
<br>So didst Thou lead Thy people,
<br>To make Thyself a glorious name.’
<br>
<br>15Look down from heaven, and see,
<br>Even from Thy holy and glorious habitation;
<br>Where is Thy zeal and Thy mighty acts,
<br>The yearning of Thy heart and Thy compassions,
<br>Now restrained toward me? 16For Thou art our Father; For Abraham knoweth us not,
<br>And Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou, O LORD, art our Father,
<br> 
<br>Our Redeemer from everlasting is Thy name.
<br>17O LORD, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways,
<br>And hardenest our heart from Thy fear?
<br>Return for Thy servants’sake, The tribes of Thine inheritance. 18Thy holy people they have well
<br>nigh driven out,
<br>Our adversaries have trodden down Thy sanctuary.
<br>19We are become as they over whom Thou never borest rule,
<br>As they that were not called by Thy name.
<br>
<br>Oh, that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down,
<br>That the mountains might quake at Thy presence,
<br>As when fire kindleth the brush-wood,
<br>And the fire causeth the waters to boil;
<br>To make Thy name known to Thine adversaries,
<br>That the nations might tremble at Thy presence,
<br>2When Thou didst tremendous things
<br>Which we looked not for—
<br>Oh that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence!—
<br>3And whereof from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
<br> 
<br>Neither hath the eye seen a God beside Thee,
<br>Who worketh for him that waiteth for Him.
<br>
<br>4Thou didst take away him that joyfully worked righteousness,
<br>Those that remembered Thee in Thy ways—
<br>Behold, Thou wast wroth, and we sinned—
<br>Upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved.
<br>5And we are all become as one that is unclean,
<br>And all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment;
<br>And we all do fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind,
<br>take us away.
<br>6And there is none that calleth upon Thy name,
<br>That stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee;
<br>For Thou hast hid Thy face from us,
<br>And hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
<br>
<br>7But now, O LORD, Thou art our Father;
<br>We are the clay, and Thou our potter,
<br>And we all are the work of Thy hand.
<br>8Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, Neither remember iniquity for ever;
<br>Behold, look, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people.
<br> 
<br>9Thy holy cities are become a wilderness,
<br>Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
<br>10Our holy and our beautiful house, Where our fathers praised Thee,
<br>Is burned with fire;
<br>And all our pleasant things are laid waste.
<br>11Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these things, O LORD?
<br>Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
<br>I gave access to them that asked not for Me,
<br>I was at hand to them that sought Me not;
<br>I said: ‘Behold Me, behold Me’,
<br>Unto a nation that was not called by My name.
<br>2I have spread out My hands all the day
<br>Unto a rebellious people,
<br>That walk in a way that is not good, After their own thoughts;
<br>3A people that provoke Me To My face continually, That sacrifice in gardens,
<br>And burn incense upon bricks; 4That sit among the graves, And lodge in the vaults;
<br>That eat swine’s flesh,
<br>And broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
<br>5That say: ‘Stand by thyself,
<br>Come not near to me, for I am holier than thou’;
<br>These are a smoke in My nose, A fire that burneth all the day.
<br> 
<br>6Behold, it is written before Me;
<br>I will not keep silence, except I have requited,
<br>Yea, I will requite into their bosom,
<br>7Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
<br>Saith the LORD, that have offered upon the mountains,
<br>And blasphemed Me upon the hills;
<br>Therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom.
<br>
<br>8Thus saith the LORD:
<br>As, when wine is found in the cluster,
<br>One saith: ‘Destroy it not, For a blessing is in it’;
<br>So will I do for My servants’ sakes, That I may not destroy all.
<br>9And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob,
<br>And out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains;
<br>And Mine elect shall inherit it, And My servants shall dwell there. 10And Sharon shall be a fold of
<br>flocks,
<br>And the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in,
<br>For My people that have sought Me;
<br>11But ye that forsake the LORD, That forget My holy mountain, That prepare a table for Fortune,
<br>And that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny,
<br>12I will destine you to the sword,
<br>And ye shall all bow down to the slaughter;
<br> 
<br>Because when I called, ye did not answer,
<br>Ehen I spoke, ye did not hear; But ye did that which was evil in
<br>Mine eyes,
<br>And chose that wherein I delighted not.
<br>
<br>13Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat,
<br>But ye shall be hungry;
<br>Behold, My servants shall drink, But ye shall be thirsty;
<br>Behold, My servants shall rejoice, But ye shall be ashamed; 14Behold, My servants shall sing For joy of heart,
<br>But ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, And shall wail for vexation of spirit. 15And ye shall leave your name for a
<br>curse unto Mine elect:
<br>‘So may the Lord GOD slay thee’;
<br>But He shall call His servants by another name;
<br>16So that he who blesseth himself in the earth
<br>Shall bless himself by the God of truth;
<br>And he that sweareth in the earth Shall swear by the God of truth;
<br>Because the former troubles are forgotten,
<br>And because they are hid from Mine eyes.
<br>17For, behold, I create new heavens And a new earth;
<br>And the former things shall not be remembered,
<br>Nor come into mind.
<br> 
<br>18But be ye glad and rejoice for ever In that which I create;
<br>For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
<br>And her people a joy.
<br>19And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people;
<br>And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her,
<br>Nor the voice of crying.
<br>20There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man,
<br>That hath not filled his days;
<br>For the youngest shall die a hundred years old,
<br>And the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<br>21And they shall build houses, and inhabit them;
<br>And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<br>22They shall not build, and another inhabit,
<br>They shall not plant, and another eat;
<br>For as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people,
<br>And Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
<br>23They shall not labour in vain, Nor bring forth for terror;
<br>For they are the seed blessed of the LORD,
<br>And their offspring with them.
<br>24And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer,
<br>And while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<br> 
<br>25The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
<br>And the lion shall eat straw like the ox;
<br>And dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all
<br>My holy mountain, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>The heaven is My throne, And the earth is My footstool;
<br>Where is the house that ye may build unto Me?
<br>And where is the place that may be My resting-place?
<br>2For all these things hath My hand made,
<br>And so all these things came to be, Saith the LORD;
<br>But on this man will I look,
<br>Even on him that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
<br>And trembleth at My word.
<br>3He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man;
<br>He that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he broke a dog’s neck;
<br>He that offereth a meal-offering, as if he offered swine’s blood;
<br>He that maketh a memorial-offering of frankincense, as if he blessed an idol;
<br>According as they have chosen their own ways,
<br>And their soul delighteth in their abominations;
<br>4Even so I will choose their mockings,
<br> 
<br>And will bring their fears upon them;
<br>Because when I called, none did answer;
<br>When I spoke, they did not hear, But they did that which was evil in
<br>Mine eyes,
<br>And chose that in which I delighted not.
<br>
<br>5Hear the word of the LORD, Ye that tremble at His word:
<br>Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for My name’s sake, have said:
<br>‘Let the LORD be glorified,
<br>That we may gaze upon your joy’, But they shall be ashamed.
<br>6Hark! an uproar from the city, Hark! it cometh from the temple,
<br>Hark! the LORD rendereth recompense to His enemies.
<br>7Before she travailed, she brought forth;
<br>Before her pain came,
<br>She was delivered of a man-child.
<br>8Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things?
<br>Is a land born in one day?
<br>Is a nation brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, She brought forth her children.
<br>9Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>Shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb?
<br>Saith thy God.
<br> 
<br>10Rejoice ye with Jerusalem,
<br>And be glad with her, all ye that love her;
<br>Rejoice for joy with her, All ye that mourn for her;
<br>11That ye may suck, and be satisfied With the breast of her consolations;
<br>That ye may drink deeply with delight
<br>Of the abundance of her glory.
<br>12For thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river.
<br>And the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream,
<br>And ye shall suck thereof:
<br>Ye shall be borne upon the side,
<br>And shall be dandled upon the knees.
<br>13As one whom his mother comforteth,
<br>So will I comfort you;
<br>And ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<br>14And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice,
<br>And your bones shall flourish like young grass;
<br>And the hand of the LORD shall be known toward His servants,
<br>And He will have indignation against His enemies.
<br>
<br>15For, behold, the LORD will come in fire,
<br>And His chariots shall be like the whirlwind;
<br>To render His anger with fury,
<br>And His rebuke with flames of fire.
<br> 
<br>16For by fire will the LORD contend, And by His sword with all flesh;
<br>And the slain of the LORD shall be many.
<br>17They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves
<br>To go unto the gardens, Behind one in the midst,
<br>Eating swine’s flesh, and the detestable thing, and the mouse,
<br>Shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
<br>18For I [know] their works and their thoughts; [the time] cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see My glory. 19And I will work a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations. 20And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in fitters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to My holy
<br> 
<br>mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. 21And of them also will I take for the priests and for the Levites, saith the LORD. 22For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<br>23And it shall come to pass,
<br>That from one new moon to another, And from one sabbath to another,
<br>Shall all flesh come to worship before Me,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>24And they shall go forth, and look Upon the carcasses of the men that
<br>have rebelled against Me; For their worm shall not die,
<br>Neither shall their fire be quenched;
<br>And they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
<br>
<br>And it shall come to pass,
<br>That from one new moon to another, And from one sabbath to another,
<br>Shall all flesh come to worship before Me, Saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>ירמיה
<br>JEREMIAH
<br> 
<br>THE WORDS of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, 2to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 3It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth
<br>month.
<br>4And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<br>5Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee,
<br>And before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee;
<br>I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.
<br>6Then said I: ‘Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.’ 7But the LORD said unto me:
<br>Say not: I am a child;
<br>For to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go,
<br>And whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.
<br>8Be not afraid of them;
<br>For I am with thee to deliver thee, Saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>9Then the LORD put forth His hand, and touched my mouth; and the LORD said unto me:
<br>Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth;
<br>10See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,
<br>To root out and to pull down, And to destroy and to overthrow; To build, and to plant.
<br>
<br>11Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying: ‘Jeremiah, what seest thou?’ And I said: ‘I see a rod of an aalmond-tree.’ 12Then said the LORD unto me: ‘Thou hast well seen; for I bwatch over My word to perform it.’
<br>13And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying: ‘What seest thou?’ And I said: ‘I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is from the north.’ 14Then the LORD said unto me: ‘Out of the north the evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 15For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the
<br>
<br>
<br>a Heb. shaked.
<br>b Heb. shoked
<br> 
<br>walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. 16And I will utter My judgments against them touching all their wickedness; in that they have forsaken me, and have offered unto other gods, and worshipped the work of their own hands. 17Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them. 18For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 19And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.’
<br>
<br>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying: 2Go, and cry in the
<br>ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the LORD:
<br>I remember for thee the affection of thy youth,
<br>The love of thine espousals;
<br>How thou wentest after Me in the wilderness,
<br>In a land that was not sown.
<br>3Israel is the LORD’S hallowed portion,
<br>His first-fruits of the increase;
<br>All that devour him shall be held guilty,
<br> 
<br>Evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>4Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob,
<br>And all the families of the house of Israel;
<br>5Thus saith the LORD:
<br>What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me,
<br>That they are gone far from Me,
<br>And have walked after things of nought, and are become nought?
<br>6Neither said they:
<br>‘Where is the LORD that brought us up
<br>Out of the land of Egypt;
<br>That led us through the wilderness,
<br>Through a land of deserts and of pits,
<br>Through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,
<br>Through a land that no man passed through,
<br>And where no man dwelt?’
<br>7And I brought you into a land of fruitful fields, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled My land, and made My heritage an abomination.
<br>8The priests said not: ‘Where is the LORD?’
<br>And they that handle the law knew Me not,
<br>And the rulers transgressed against Me;
<br>The prophets also prophesied by Baal,
<br> 
<br>And walked after things that do not profit.
<br>9Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD,
<br>And with your children’s children will I plead.
<br>10For pass over to the isles of the Kittites, and see,
<br>And send unto Kedar, and consider diligently,
<br>And see if there hath been such a thing.
<br>11Hath a nation changed its gods, Which yet are no gods?
<br>But My people hath changed its glory
<br>For that which doth not profit.
<br>12Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this,
<br>And be horribly afraid, be ye exceeding amazed,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>13For My people have committed two evils:
<br>They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters,
<br>And hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
<br>That can hold no water.
<br>
<br>14Is Israel a servant?
<br>Is he a home-born slave? Why is he become a prey?
<br>15The young lions have roared upon him,
<br>And let their voice resound;
<br>And they have made his land desolate,
<br>His cities are laid waste,
<br> 
<br>Without inhabitant.
<br>16The children also of Noph and Tahpanhes
<br>Feed upon the crown of thy head.
<br>17Is it not this that doth cause it unto thee,
<br>That thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God,
<br>When He led thee by the way?
<br>
<br>18And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt,
<br>To drink the waters of Shihor?
<br>Or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria,
<br>To drink the waters of the River?
<br>19Thine own wickedness shall correct thee,
<br>And thy backslidings shall reprove thee:
<br>Know therefore and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing,
<br>That thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God,
<br>Neither is My fear in thee, Saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
<br>
<br>20For of old time I have broken thy yoke,
<br>And burst thy bands,
<br>And thou saidst: ‘I will not transgress’;
<br>Upon every high hill
<br>And under every leafy tree Thou didst recline, playing the
<br>harlot.
<br>21Yet I had planted thee a noble vine,
<br>Wholly a right seed;
<br> 
<br>How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant
<br>Of a strange vine unto Me?
<br>22For though thou wash thee with nitre,
<br>And take thee much soap,
<br>Yet thine iniquity is marked before Me,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD.
<br>
<br>23How canst thou say: ‘I am not defiled,
<br>I have not gone after the Baalim’? See thy way in the Valley,
<br>Know what thou hast done;
<br>Thou art a swift young camel traversing her ways;
<br>24A wild ass used to the wilderness,
<br>That snuffeth up the wind in her desire;
<br>Her lust, who can hinder it?
<br>All they that seek her will not weary themselves;
<br>In her month they shall find her.
<br>25Withhold thy foot from being unshod,
<br>And thy throat from thirst;
<br>But thou saidst: ‘There is no hope;
<br>No, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.’
<br>
<br>26As the thief is ashamed when he is found,
<br>So is the house of Israel ashamed; They, their kings, their princes,
<br>And their priests, and their prophets;
<br>27Who say to a stock: ‘Thou art my father’,
<br> 
<br>And to a stone: ‘Thou hast brought us forth’,
<br>For they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face;
<br>But in the time of their trouble they will say:
<br>‘Arise, and save us.’
<br>28But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee?
<br>Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble;
<br>For according to the number of thy cities
<br>Are thy gods, O Judah.
<br>
<br>29Wherefore will ye contend with Me?
<br>Ye all have transgressed against Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>30In vain have I smitten your children—
<br>They received no correction;
<br>Your sword hath devoured your prophets,
<br>Like a destroying lion.
<br>31O generation, see ye the word of the LORD:
<br>Have I been a wilderness unto Israel?
<br>Or a land of thick darkness?
<br>Wherefore say My people: ‘We roam at large;
<br>We will come no more unto Thee’? 32Can a maid forget her ornaments, Or a bride her attire?
<br>Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number.
<br>
<br>33How trimmest thou thy way
<br> 
<br>To seek love!
<br>Therefore—even the wicked women Hast thou taught thy ways;
<br>34Also in thy skirts is found the blood
<br>Of the souls of the innocent poor;
<br>Thou didst not find them breaking in;
<br>Yet for all these things
<br>35Thou saidst: ‘I am innocent;
<br>Surely His anger is turned away from me’—
<br>Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee,
<br>Because thou sayest: ‘I have not sinned.’
<br>
<br>36How greatly dost thou cheapen thyself
<br>To change thy way?
<br>Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also,
<br>As thou wast ashamed of Asshur. 37From him also shalt thou go forth, With thy hands upon thy head;
<br>For the LORD hath rejected them in whom thou didst trust,
<br>And thou shalt not prosper in them.
<br>
<br>. . . saying:
<br>If a man put away his wife, And she go from him,
<br>And become another man’s, May he return unto her again?
<br>Will not that land be greatly polluted?
<br>But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers;
<br> 
<br>And wouldest thou yet return to Me?
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>2Lift up thine eyes unto the high hills, and see:
<br>Where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, As an Arabian in the wilderness; And thou hast polluted the land With thy harlotries and with thy
<br>wickedness.
<br>3Therefore the showers have been withheld,
<br>And there hath been no latter rain; Yet thou hadst a harlot’s forehead, Thou refusedst to be ashamed.
<br>4Didst thou not just now cry unto Me: ‘My father,
<br>Thou art the friend of my youth. 5Will He bear grudge for ever? Will He keep it to the end?’
<br>Behold, thou hast spoken, but hast done evil things,
<br>And hast had thy way.
<br>6And the LORD said unto me in the days of Josiah the king: ‘Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel did? she went up upon every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and there played the harlot. 7And I said: After she hath done all these things, she will return unto me; but she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 8And I saw, when, forasmuch as backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, that yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the
<br> 
<br>harlot; 9and it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks; 10and yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto Me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD— 11even the LORD said unto me—backsliding Israel hath proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. 12Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say:
<br>Return, thou backsliding Israel, Saith the LORD;
<br>I will not frown upon you;
<br>For I am merciful, saith the LORD, I will not bear grudge for ever.
<br>13Only acknowledge thine iniquity,
<br>That thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God,
<br>And hast scattered thy ways to the strangers
<br>Under every leafy tree,
<br>And ye have not hearkened to My voice,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>14Return, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am a lord unto you, and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion; 15and I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 16And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of the LORD; neither shall it come to mind; neither
<br> 
<br>shall they make mention of it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more. 17At that time they shall call Jerusalem The throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 18In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.’
<br>
<br>19But I said: ‘How would I put thee among the sons,
<br>And give thee a pleasant land,
<br>The goodliest heritage of the nations! ’
<br>And I said: ‘Thou shalt call Me, My father;
<br>And shalt not turn away from following Me.’
<br>20Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband,
<br>So have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>21Hark! upon the high hills is heard The suppliant weeping of the
<br>children of Israel;
<br>For that they have perverted their way,
<br>They have forgotten the LORD their God.
<br>
<br>22Return, ye backsliding children,
<br> 
<br>I will heal your backslidings.— ‘Here we are, we are come unto
<br>Thee;
<br>For Thou art the LORD our God. 23Truly vain have proved the hills, The uproar on the mountains; Truly in the LORD our God
<br>Is the salvation of Israel.
<br>24But the shameful thing hath devoured
<br>The labour of our fathers from our youth;
<br>Their flocks and their herds, Their sons and their daughters. 25Let us lie down in our shame, And let our confusion cover us;
<br>For we have sinned against the LORD our God,
<br>We and our fathers,
<br>From our youth even unto this day; And we have not hearkened
<br>To the voice of the LORD our God.’
<br>
<br>If thou wilt return, O Israel, Saith the LORD,
<br>Yea, return unto Me;
<br>And if thou wilt put away thy detestable things out of My sight,
<br>And wilt not waver;
<br>2And wilt swear: ‘As the LORD liveth’
<br>In truth, in justice, and in righteousness;
<br>Then shall the nations bless themselves by Him,
<br>And in Him shall they glory.
<br>
<br>3For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:
<br> 
<br>Break up for you a fallow ground, And sow not among thorns.
<br>4Circumcise yourselves to the LORD,
<br>And take away the foreskins of your heart,
<br>Ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
<br>Lest My fury go forth like fire, And burn that none can quench it, Because of the evil of your doings.
<br>
<br>5Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem,
<br>And say: ‘Blow ye the horn in the land’;
<br>Cry aloud and say:
<br>‘Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.’
<br>6Set up a standard toward Zion;
<br>Put yourselves under covert, stay not;
<br>For I will bring evil from the north, And a great destruction.
<br>7A lion is gone up from his thicket, And a destroyer of nations
<br>Is set out, gone forth from his place; To make thy land desolate,
<br>That thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
<br>8For this gird you with sackcloth, Lament and wail;
<br>For the fierce anger of the LORD Is not turned back from us.
<br>9And it shall come to pass at that day,
<br>Saith the LORD,
<br>That the heart of the king shall fail, And the heart of the princes;
<br>And the priests shall be astonished,
<br> 
<br>And the prophets shall wonder.
<br>
<br>10Then said I: ‘Ah, Lord GOD! surely Thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.’
<br>11At that time shall it be said of this people and of Jerusalem;
<br>A hot wind of the high hills in the wilderness
<br>Toward the daughter of My people, Not to fan, nor to cleanse;
<br>12A wind too strong for this shall come for Me;
<br>Now will I also utter judgments against them.
<br>13Behold, he cometh up as clouds,
<br>And his chariots are as the whirlwind;
<br>His horses are swifter than eagles.— ’Woe unto us! for we are
<br>undone.’—
<br>14O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness,
<br>That thou mayest be saved.
<br>How long shall thy baleful thoughts Lodge within thee?
<br>15For hark! one declareth from Dan,
<br>And announceth calamity from the hills of Ephraim:
<br>16’Make ye mention to the nations: Behold—publish concerning
<br>Jerusalem—
<br>Watchers come from a far country,
<br>And give out their voice against the cities of Judah.’
<br>17As keepers of a field
<br>Are they against her round about;
<br> 
<br>Because she hath been rebellious against Me,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>18Thy way and thy doings have procured
<br>These things unto thee;
<br>This is thy wickedness; yea, it is bitter,
<br>Yea, it reacheth unto thy heart.
<br>
<br>19My bowels, my bowels! I writhe in pain!
<br>The chambers of my heart! My heart moaneth within me! I cannot hold my peace!
<br>Because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the horn,
<br>The alarm of war.
<br>20Destruction followeth upon destruction,
<br>For the whole land is spoiled; Suddenly are my tents spoiled, My curtains in a moment.
<br>21How long shall I see the standard, Shall I hear the sound of the horn?
<br>
<br>22For My people is foolish, They know Me not;
<br>They are sottish children,
<br>And they have no understanding; They are wise to do evil,
<br>But to do good they have no knowl- edge.
<br>
<br>23I beheld the earth,
<br>And, lo, it was waste and void;
<br>And the heavens, and they had no light.
<br> 
<br>24I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled,
<br>And all the hills moved to and fro.
<br>25I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,
<br>And all the birds of the heavens were fled.
<br>26I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness,
<br>And all the cities thereof were broken down
<br>At the presence of the LORD, And before His fierce anger.
<br>
<br>27For thus saith the LORD:
<br>The whole land shall be desolate; Yet will I not make a full end.
<br>28For this shall the earth mourn, And the heavens above be black;
<br>Because I have spoken it, I have purposed it,
<br>And I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
<br>29For the noise of the horsemen and bowmen
<br>The whole city fleeth; They go into the thickets,
<br>And climb up upon the rocks; Every city is forsaken,
<br>And not a man dwelleth therein.
<br>30And thou, that art spoiled, what doest thou,
<br>That thou clothest thyself with scarlet,
<br>That thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold,
<br>That thou enlargest thine eyes with paint?
<br>In vain dost thou make thyself fair;
<br> 
<br>Thy lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.
<br>31For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
<br>The anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child,
<br>The voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath,
<br>That spreadeth her hands: ‘Woe is me, now! for my soul
<br>fainteth
<br>Before the murderers.’
<br>
<br>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,
<br>And see now, and know,
<br>And seek in the broad places thereof,
<br>If ye can find a man,
<br>If there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth;
<br>And I will pardon her.
<br>2And though they say: ‘As the LORD liveth’,
<br>Surely they swear falsely.
<br>3O LORD, are not Thine eyes upon truth?
<br>Thou hast stricken them, but they were not affected;
<br>Thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction;
<br>They have made their faces harder than a rock;
<br>They have refused to return.
<br>4And I said: ‘Surely these are poor,
<br>They are foolish, for they know not the way of the LORD,
<br>Nor the ordinance of their God;
<br> 
<br>5I will get me unto the great men, And will speak unto them;
<br>For they know the way of the LORD, And the ordinance of their God.’
<br>But these had altogether broken the yoke,
<br>And burst the bands.
<br>6Wherefore a lion out of the forest doth slay them,
<br>A wolf of the deserts doth spoil them,
<br>A leopard watcheth over their cities,
<br>Every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces;
<br>Because their transgressions are many,
<br>Their backslidings are increased.
<br>
<br>7Wherefore should I pardon thee? The children have forsaken Me, And sworn by no-gods;
<br>And when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery,
<br>And assembled themselves in troops at the harlots’houses.
<br>8They are become as well-fed horses, lusty stallions;
<br>Every one neigheth after his neighbour’s wife.
<br>9Shall I not punish for these things? Saith the LORD;
<br>And shall not My soul be avenged On such a nation as this?
<br>
<br>10Go ye up into her rows, and destroy,
<br>But make not a full end; Take away her shoots;
<br>For they are not the LORD’S.
<br> 
<br>11For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
<br>Have dealt very treacherously against Me,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>12They have belied the LORD, And said: ‘It is not He,
<br>Neither shall evil come upon us;
<br>Neither shall we see sword nor famine;
<br>13And the prophets shall become wind,
<br>And the word is not in them; Thus be it done unto them.’
<br>14Wherefore thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts:
<br>Because ye speak this word,
<br>Behold, I will make My words in thy mouth fire,
<br>And this people wood, and it shall devour them.
<br>15Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far,
<br>O house of Israel, saith the LORD; It is an enduring nation,
<br>It is an ancient nation,
<br>A nation whose language thou knowest not,
<br>Neither understandest what they say.
<br>16Their quiver is an open sepulchre, They are all mighty men.
<br>17And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread,
<br>They shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters,
<br>They shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds,
<br> 
<br>They shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees;
<br>They shall batter thy fortified cities,
<br>Wherein thou trusteth, with the sword.
<br>18But even in those days, saith the LORD,
<br>I will not make a full end with you. 19And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say: ‘Wherefore hath the LORD our God done all these things unto us?’ then shalt Thou say unto them: ‘Like as ye have forsaken Me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’
<br>
<br>20Declare ye this in the house of Jacob,
<br>And announce it in Judah, saying:
<br>21Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding,
<br>That have eyes, and see not, That have ears, and hear not: 22Fear ye not Me? saith the LORD;
<br>Will ye not tremble at My presence?
<br>Who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea,
<br>An everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass;
<br>And though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail;
<br>Though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.
<br>23But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart;
<br>They are revolted, and gone.
<br>24Neither say they in their heart:
<br> 
<br>‘Let us now fear the LORD our God,
<br>That giveth the former rain, and the latter in due season;
<br>That keepeth for us
<br>The appointed weeks of the harvest.’
<br>25Your iniquities have turned away these things,
<br>And your sins have withholden good from you.
<br>26For among My people are found wicked men;
<br>They pry, as fowlers lie in wait; They set a trap, they catch men. 27As a cage is full of birds,
<br>So are their houses full of deceit; Therefore they are become great,
<br>and waxen rich;
<br>28They are waxen fat, they are become sleek;
<br>Yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness;
<br>They plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless,
<br>That they might make it to prosper;
<br>And the right of the needy do they not judge.
<br>29Shall I not punish for these things? Saith the LORD;
<br>Shall not My soul be avenged On such a nation as this?
<br>
<br>30An appalling and horrible thing Is come to pass in the land: 31The prophets prophesy in the
<br>service of falsehood,
<br>And the priests bear rule at their beck;
<br>And My people love to have it so;
<br> 
<br>What then will ye do in the end thereof?
<br>
<br>Put yourselves under covert, ye children of Benjamin,
<br>Away from the midst of Jerusalem, And blow the horn in Tekoa,
<br>And set up a signal on Beth-cherem;
<br>For evil looketh forth from the north,
<br>And a great destruction.
<br>2The comely and delicate one,
<br>The daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
<br>3Shepherds with their flocks come unto her;
<br>They pitch their tents against her round about;
<br>They feed bare every one what is nigh at hand.
<br>4’Prepare ye war against her; Arise, and let us go up at noon! ’
<br>’Woe unto us! for the day declineth,
<br>For the shadows of the evening are stretched out! ’
<br>5’Arise, and let us go up by night, And let us destroy her palaces.’
<br>
<br>6For thus hath the LORD of hosts said:
<br>Hew ye down her trees,
<br>And cast up a mound against Jerusalem;
<br>This is the city to be punished;
<br>Everywhere there is oppression in the midst of her.
<br>7As a cistern welleth with her waters,
<br>So she welleth with her wickedness; Violence and spoil is heard in her;
<br> 
<br>Before Me continually is sickness and wounds.
<br>8Be thou corrected, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from thee, Lest I make thee desolate,
<br>A land not inhabited.
<br>
<br>9Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>They shall thoroughly glean as a vine
<br>The remnant of Israel; Turn again thy hand
<br>As a grape-gatherer upon the shoots.
<br>10To whom shall I speak and give warning,
<br>That they may hear? Behold, their ear is dull, And they cannot attend;
<br>Behold, the word of the LORD is become unto them a reproach,
<br>They have no delight in it.
<br>11Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD,
<br>I am weary with holding in:
<br>Pour it out upon the babes in the street,
<br>And upon the assembly of young men together;
<br>For even the husband with the wife shall be taken,
<br>The aged with him that is full of days.
<br>12And their houses shall be turned unto others,
<br>Their fields and their wives together;
<br>For I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of the land,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>13For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them
<br>Every one is greedy for gain;
<br>And from the prophet even unto the priest
<br>Every one dealeth falsely.
<br>14They have healed also the hurt of My people lightly,
<br>Saying: ‘Peace, peace’, when there is no peace.
<br>15They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination;
<br>Yea, they are not at all ashamed, Neither know they how to blush;
<br>Therefore they shall fall among them that fall,
<br>At the time that I punish them they shall stumble,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>16Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Stand ye in the ways and see, And ask for the old paths,
<br>Where is the good way, and walk therein,
<br>And ye shall find rest for your souls.
<br>But they said: ‘We will not walk therein.’
<br>17And I set watchmen over you: ‘Attend to the sound of the horn’, But they said: ‘We will not attend.’ 18Therefore hear, ye nations,
<br>And know, O congregation, what is against them.
<br>19Hear, O earth:
<br>Behold, I will bring evil upon this people,
<br>Even the fruit of their thoughts,
<br> 
<br>Because they have not attended unto My words,
<br>And as for My teaching, they have rejected it.
<br>20To what purpose is to Me the frankincense that cometh from Sheba,
<br>And the sweet cane, from a far country?
<br>Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable,
<br>Nor your sacrifices pleasing unto Me.
<br>21Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people,
<br>And the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them,
<br>The neighbour and his friend, and they shall perish.
<br>
<br>22Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, a people cometh from the north country,
<br>And a great nation shall be roused from the uttermost parts of the earth.
<br>23They lay hold on bow and spear,
<br>They are cruel, and have no compassion;
<br>Their voice is like the roaring sea, And they ride upon horses;
<br>Set in array, as a man for war, Against thee, O daughter of Zion.
<br>
<br>24’We have heard the fame thereof, our hands wax feeble,
<br> 
<br>Anguish hath taken hold of us,
<br>And pain, as of a woman in travail.’
<br>25Go not forth into the field, Nor walk by the way;
<br>For there is the sword of the enemy, And terror on every side.
<br>26O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth,
<br>And wallow thyself in ashes;
<br>Make thee mourning, as for an only son,
<br>Most bitter lamentation;
<br>For the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
<br>
<br>27I have made thee a tower and a fortress among My people;
<br>That thou mayest know and try their way.
<br>28They are all grievous revolters, Going about with slanders; They are brass and iron;
<br>They all of them deal corruptly. 29The bellows blow fiercely, The lead is consumed of the fire; In vain doth the founder refine,
<br>For the wicked are not separated.
<br>30Refuse silver shall men call them,
<br>Because the LORD hath rejected them.
<br>
<br>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying: 2Stand in
<br>the gate of the LORD’S house, and proclaim there this word, and say: Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. 3Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br> 
<br>Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. 4Trust ye not in lying words, saying: ‘The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, are these.’ 5Nay, but if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbour; 6if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt; 7then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. 8Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 9Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and offer unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye have not known, 10and come and stand before Me in this house, whereupon My name is called, and say: ‘We are delivered’, that ye may do all these abominations? 11Is this house, whereupon My name is called, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith the LORD. 12For go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh, where I caused My name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Israel. 13And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke unto you, speaking betimes and often, but ye heard not, and I called you, but ye answered not; 14therefore will I do unto the house, whereupon My name
<br> 
<br>is called, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 15And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
<br>16Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to Me; for I will not hear thee. 17Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 18The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke Me. 19Do they provoke Me? saith the LORD; do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces? 20Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, Mine anger and My fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the land; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
<br>21Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt- offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh. 22For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices; 23but this thing I commanded them, saying: ‘Hearken unto My voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be My people; and walk
<br> 
<br>ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’ 24But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels, even in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward, 25even since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day; and though I have sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily betimes and often, 26yet they hearkened not unto Me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff; they did worse than their fathers.
<br>27And thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they will not hearken to thee; thou shalt also call unto them, but they will not answer thee. 28Therefore thou shalt say unto them:
<br>This is the nation that hath not hearkened
<br>To the voice of the LORD their God, Nor received correction; Faithfulness is perished,
<br>And is cut off from their mouth.
<br>
<br>29Cut off thy hair, and cast it away,
<br>And take up a lamentation on the high hills;
<br>For the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
<br>30For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight, saith the LORD; they have set their detestable things in the house whereon My name is called, to defile it. 31And they have
<br> 
<br>built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind. 32Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter; for they shall bury in Topheth, for lack of room. 33And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away. 34Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land
<br>shall be desolate. 1At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring
<br>out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves; 2and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped; they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. 3And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the
<br> 
<br>places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>4Moreover thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Do men fall, and not rise up again? Doth one turn away, and not return? 5Why then is this people of
<br>Jerusalem slidden back By a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit,
<br>They refuse to return.
<br>6I attended and listened, But they spoke not aright;
<br>No man repenteth him of his wickedness,
<br>Saying: ‘What have I done?’
<br>Every one turneth away in his course,
<br>As a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.
<br>7Yea, the stork in the heaven Knoweth her appointed times;
<br>And the turtle and the swallow and the crane
<br>Observe the time of their coming; But My people know not
<br>The ordinance of the LORD.
<br>8How do ye say: ‘We are wise,
<br>And the Law of the LORD is with us’?
<br>Lo, certainly in vain hath wrought The vain pen of the scribes.
<br>9The wise men are ashamed, They are dismayed and taken;
<br>Lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD;
<br>And what wisdom is in them?
<br> 
<br>10Therefore will I give their wives unto others,
<br>And their fields to them that shall possess them;
<br>For from the least even unto the greatest
<br>Every one is greedy for gain,
<br>From the prophet even unto the priest
<br>Every one dealeth falsely.
<br>11And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people lightly,
<br>Saying: ‘Peace, peace’, when there is no peace.
<br>12They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination;
<br>Yea, they are not at all ashamed, Neither know they how to blush; therefore shall they fall among
<br>them that fall,
<br>In the time of their visitation they shall stumble,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>13I will utterly consume them, saith the LORD;
<br>There are no grapes on the vine, Nor figs on the fig-tree,
<br>And the leaf is faded;
<br>And I gave them that which they transgress.
<br>14’Why do we sit still?
<br>Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities,
<br>And let us be cut off there;
<br>For the LORD our God hath cut us off,
<br>And given us water of gall to drink,
<br> 
<br>Because we have sinned against the LORD.
<br>15We looked for peace, but no good came;
<br>And for a time of healing, and behold terror! ’
<br>16The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan;
<br>At the sound of the neighing of his strong ones
<br>The whole land trembleth;
<br>For they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it,
<br>The city and those that dwell therein.
<br>17For, behold, I will send serpents, basilisks, among you,
<br>Which will not be charmed;
<br>And they shall bite you, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>18Though I would take comfort against sorrow,
<br>My heart is faint within me.
<br>19Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people
<br>From a land far off:
<br>‘Is not the LORD in Zion? Is not her King in her?’—
<br>‘Why have they provoked Me with their graven images,
<br>And with strange vanities?’—
<br>20’The harvest is past, the summer is ended,
<br>And we are not saved.’
<br>21For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I seized with anguish;
<br> 
<br>I am black, appalment hath taken hold on me.
<br>22Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health Of the daughter of my people
<br>recovered?
<br>23Oh that my head were waters, And mine eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my
<br>people!
<br>
<br>Oh that I were in the wilderness,
<br>In a lodging-place of wayfaring men,
<br>That I might leave my people, And go from them!
<br>For they are all adulterers,
<br>An assembly of treacherous men.
<br>2And they bend their tongue, their bow of falsehood;
<br>And they are grown mighty in the land, but not for truth;
<br>For they proceed from evil to evil, And Me they know not,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>3Take ye heed every one of his neighbour,
<br>And trust ye not in any brother; For every brother acteth subtly,
<br>And every neighbour goeth about with slanders.
<br>4And they deceive every one his neighbour,
<br>And truth they speak not;
<br>They have taught their tongue to speak lies,
<br> 
<br>They weary themselves to commit iniquity.
<br>5Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit;
<br>Through deceit they refuse to know Me,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>6Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Behold, I will smelt them, and try them;
<br>For how else should I do,
<br>Because of the daughter of My people?
<br>7Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, It speaketh deceit;
<br>One speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth,
<br>But in his heart he layeth wait for him.
<br>8Shall I not punish them for these things?
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>Shall not My soul be avenged On such a nation as this?
<br>9For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing,
<br>And for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation,
<br>Because they are burned up, so that none passeth through.
<br>And they hear not the voice of the cattle;
