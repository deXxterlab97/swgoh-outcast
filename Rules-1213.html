<br>
<br>If a participant or former participant dies and is not survived by an individual eligible for an annuity under this part or by such an individual or individuals all of whose annuity rights terminate before a claim for survivor annuity is filed, the lump-sum credit to which the participant or annuitant is entitled shall be paid in accordance with subsection (f).
<br>(e) Death of annuitant who was former participant
<br>
<br>If an annuitant who was a former participant dies, any annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid in accordance with subsection (f).

<br>
<br>Payments under subsections (c) through (e) shall be paid in the following order of precedence to individuals surviving the participant and alive on the date entitlement to the payment arises, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person:
<br>
<br>(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries last designated by the participant before or after retirement in a signed and witnessed writing filed with the Secretary of State prior to the death of the participant, for which purpose a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document which is not so executed and filed shall have no force or effect.
<br>
<br>(2) If there is no such beneficiary, to the surviving wife or husband of the participant.
<br>

<br>(g) Death of survivor annuitant
<br>
<br>Annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
<br>
<br>(1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor annuitant.

<br>(i) Former spouses
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, the amount of a participant's or former participant's lump-sum credit payable to a former spouse of that participant shall be—
<br>
<br>(1) if the former spouse was married to the participant throughout the period of creditable service of the participant, 50 percent of the lump-sum credit to which such participant would be entitled in the absence of this subsection, or
<br>
<br>(2) if such former spouse was not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, an amount equal to such former spouse's pro rata share of 50 percent of such lump-sum credit.

Conversely, any such service performed after December 31, 1976, that would not be creditable under specified conditions under section 8332 of title 5, shall be excluded under this part under the same conditions.
<br>
<br>(2) The service of an individual who first becomes a participant on or after October 17, 1983, without any credit under this section for civilian service performed prior to October 1, 1982, shall include credit for:
<br>
<br>(A) each period of military or naval service performed before January 1, 1957, and
<br>
<br>(B) each period of military or naval service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which the entitlement to annuity under this part is based, only if a deposit (with interest if any is required) is made with respect to that period, as provided in section 4045(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The service of an individual who first became a participant on or after October 17, 1983, with credit under this section for civilian service performed prior to October 1982, shall include credit for each period of military or naval service performed before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to an annuity under this part is based, subject, in the case of military or naval service performed after December 1956, to subsection (j).
<br>
<br>(4) The service of an individual who first became a participant before October 17, 1983, shall include credit for each period of military or naval service performed before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to an annuity under this part is based, subject, in the case of military or naval service performed after December 1976, to subsection (j).
<br>(b) Unused sick leave credit
<br>
<br>In computing any annuity under this part, the total service of a participant who retires on an immediate annuity or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes (without regard to the 35-year limitation imposed by section 4046(a) of this title) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the participant, except that these days shall not be counted in determining average basic salary or annuity eligibility under this part. A contribution to the Fund shall not be required from a participant for this service credit.
<br>(c) Service with other Government agency when on approved leave without pay; arrangement for payment of retirement deductions and agency contributions; special contribution
<br>
<br>(1) A participant who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of Government employees may, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, file with the employing agency an election to receive full retirement credit for such periods of leave without pay and arrange to pay concurrently into the Fund through the employing agency, amounts equal to the retirement deductions and agency contributions on the Foreign Service salary rate that would be applicable if the participant were in a pay status. If the election and all payments provided by this subsection are not made for the periods of such leave without pay occurring after November 7, 1976, the participant may not receive any credit for such periods of leave without pay occurring after such date.
<br>
<br>(2) A participant may make a special contribution for any period or periods of approved leave without pay while serving before November 7, 1976, as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of Government employees. Any such contribution shall be based upon the suspended Foreign Service salary rate and shall be computed in accordance with section 4045 of this title. A participant who makes such contributions shall be allowed full retirement credit for the period or periods of leave without pay. If this contribution is not made, up to 6 months' retirement credit shall be allowed for such periods of leave without pay each calendar year.
<br>(d) Special contribution in repayment of refund of retirement contributions
<br>
<br>2 A participant who has received a refund of retirement contributions (which has not been repaid) under this or any other retirement system for Government employees covering service which may be creditable may make a special contribution for such service under section 4045 of this title. Credit may not be allowed for service covered by the refund unless the special contribution is made.
<br>(e) Civilian service under other Government retirement system
<br>
<br>No credit in annuity computation shall be allowed for any period of civilian service for which a participant made retirement contributions to another retirement system for Government employees unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the right to any annuity under the other system which is based on such service is waived, and
<br>
<br>(2) a special contribution is made under section 4045 of this title covering such service.
<br>(f) Service in military during period of war or national emergency
<br>
<br>A participant who during a period of war, or national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress, leaves the Service to enter the military service is deemed, for the purpose of this part, as not separated from the Service unless the participant applies for and receives a lump-sum payment under section 4055 of this title. However, the participant is deemed to be separated from the Service after the expiration of 5 years of such military service.
<br>(g) Recomputation of annuity for participants of Japanese ancestry interned during World War II

Any such recomputation of an annuity shall apply with respect to months beginning more than 30 days after the date on which application for such recomputation is received by the Secretary of State.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of State shall take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to inform individuals entitled to have any service credited or annuity recomputed under this subsection of their entitlement to such credit or recomputation.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of State shall, on request, assist any individual referred to in paragraph (1) in obtaining from any agency or other Government establishment information necessary to verify the entitlement of the individual to have any service credited or any annuity recomputed under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) Any agency or other Government establishment shall, upon request, furnish to the Secretary of State any information it possesses with respect to the internment or other detention, as described in section 8332(l) of title 5, of any participant.
<br>(h) Service as employees of Member or office of Congress while on approved leave without pay
<br>
<br>A participant who, while on approved leave without pay, serves as a full-time paid employee of a Member or office of the Congress shall continue to make contributions to the Fund based upon the Foreign Service salary rate that would be in effect if the participant were in a pay status. The participant's employing office in the Congress shall make a matching contribution (from the appropriation or fund which is used for payment of the salary of the participant) to the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. All periods of service for which full contributions to the Fund are made under this subsection shall be counted as creditable service for purposes of this part and shall not, unless all retirement credit is transferred, be counted as creditable service under any other Government retirement system.
<br>(i) Former spouses
<br>
<br>(1) Service of a participant shall be considered creditable service for purposes of applying provisions of this part relating to former spouses if such service would be creditable—
<br>
<br>(A) under subsection (c)(1) or (2) but for the fact an election was not made under subsection (c)(1) or a special contribution was not made under subsection (c)(2), and
<br>
<br>(B) under subsection (d) but for the fact that a refund of contributions has not been repaid unless the former spouse received under this part a portion of the lump sum (or a spousal agreement or court order provided otherwise).
<br>
<br>(2) A former spouse shall not be considered as married to a participant for periods assumed to be creditable service under section 4048(a) of this title or section 4049(e) of this title.
<br>(j) Redetermination of credit for military and naval service
<br>
<br>(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or Executive Order, section 8332(j) of title 5, relating to redetermination of credit for military and naval service, shall be applied to annuities payable under this part. The Secretary of State shall redetermine service, and may request and obtain information from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as the Office of Personnel Management is directed or authorized to do in section 8332(j).
<br>
<br>(2) Section 8332(j) of title 5 shall not apply with respect to:
<br>
<br>(A) the service of any individual who first became a participant on or after October 17, 1983, without any credit under this section for civilian service performed prior to October 1982; or
<br>
<br>(B) any military or naval service performed prior to 1957 by an individual who first became a participant on or after October 17, 1983, with credit under this section for civilian service performed prior to October 1982, or any period of military or naval service performed after 1956 with respect to which the participant has made a contribution (with interest if any is required) under section 4045(e) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(C) any military or naval service performed prior to 1977 by any individual who first became a participant before October 17, 1983, or any period of military or naval service performed after 1976 with respect to which the participant has made a contribution (with interest if any is required) under section 4045(e) of this title.

Effective on the date the participant becomes eligible for an annuity or a deferred annuity and at the election of the participant, his or her account shall be—
<br>
<br>(1) returned in a lump sum;
<br>
<br>(2) used to purchase an additional life annuity;

<br>
<br>A cost-of-living annuity increase shall become effective under this section on the effective date of each such increase under section 8340(b) of title 5. Each such increase shall be applied to each annuity payable from the Fund under this part which has a commencing date not later than the effective date of the increase.
<br>(b) Applicability of increases under other provisions of law
<br>
<br>Each annuity increase under this section shall be identical to the corresponding percentage increase under section 8340(b) of title 5.
<br>(c) Eligibility for increases
<br>
<br>Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section shall be governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund under this part as of the effective date of an increase except as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The first increase (if any) made under this section to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to a participant or to the surviving spouse or former spouse of a deceased participant who died in service or a deceased annuitant whose annuity was not increased under this section, shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent) of—
<br>
<br>(A) 1/12 of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (b) of this section, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(B) the number of months (counting any portion of a month as a month)—
<br>
<br>(i) for which the annuity was payable from the Fund before the effective date of the increase, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a surviving spouse or former spouse of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been so increased, since the annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.
<br>
<br>(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the Fund under this part to the survivor of an annuitant, except a child entitled to an annuity under section 4046(c) of this title or section 4049(c) or (d) of this title, shall be increased by the total percentage increase the annuitant was receiving under this section at death.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of computing or recomputing an annuity to a child under section 4046(c) or (d) of this title or section 4049(c) or (d) of this title, the items $900, $1,080, $2,700, and $3,240 appearing in section 4046(c) of this title shall be increased by the total percentage increases by which corresponding amounts are being increased under section 8340 of title 5 on the date the annuity of the child becomes effective.
<br>(d) Exclusion of additional annuity purchased after retirement by voluntary contribution
<br>
<br>No increase in annuity provided by this section shall be computed on any additional annuity purchased at retirement by voluntary contributions.
<br>(e) Rounding off of amount; minimum increases
<br>
<br>The monthly installment of annuity after adjustment under this section shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar, except such installment shall after adjustment reflect an increase of at least $1.
<br>(f) Rate of increase for surviving spouses of annuitants electing reduced annuity
<br>
<br>Effective from its commencing date, there shall be an increase of 10 percent in the annuity of each surviving spouse whose entitlement to annuity resulted from the death of an annuitant who, prior to October 1, 1976, elected a reduced annuity in order to provide a spouse's survivor annuity.
<br>(g) Maximum annuity
<br>
<br>(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) the maximum pay rate payable for class FS–1 under section 3963 of this title, 30 days before the effective date of the adjustment under this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the former participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in rates of pay of the Foreign Service Schedule under such section 3963 of this title during the period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on the date the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant, the date the participant's annuity commenced), and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, "pay" means the rate of salary or basic pay as payable under any provision of law, including any provision of law limiting the expenditure of appropriated funds.

<br>
<br>"(1) The first increase (if any) made under this section to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to a participant or to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant who dies in service shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent) of—
<br>
<br>"(a) 1/6 of the applicable percent change determined under Subsection (b) of this Section, multiplied by
<br>
<br>"(b) the number of full months for which the annuity was payable from the Fund before the effective date of the increase (counting any portion of a month as a full month).".
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Section 808(a) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4048(a)) is deemed to be amended by adding at the end thereof the following:
<br>
<br>"However, if a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in Section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of title 5 of the United States Code) or Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under this chapter excluding extra credit authorized by this subsection and excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in Section 5532 of title 5 of the United States Code, or the Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired pay or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this chapter in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity computed under this chapter.".
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. The amendments to be deemed made by this Order shall take effect as of February 15, 1981.

<br>
<br>(c) Subsection (b) shall not reduce the annuity of any individual below the amount of the annuity which would be payable under chapter 8 of the Act [this subchapter] to the individual for the determination month if section 8332(j) of Title 5 of the United States Code applied to the individual for such month.
<br>
<br>(d) For purposes of this section, the term "determination month" means—

<br>
<br>(e) The preceding provisions of this section shall take effect with respect to any annuity payment payable under chapter 8 of the Act [this subchapter] for calendar months beginning after the date of this Order [Oct. 17, 1983].

<br>
<br>Sec. 6. General Limitation on Cost-of-Living Adjustment for Annuities. (a) Section 826 of the Act (22 U.S.C. 4066) is deemed to be amended to add at the end thereof the following new subsection:
<br>
<br>"(g)(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of—
<br>
<br>"(A) the maximum pay rate payable for class FS–1 under section 403, 30 days before the effective date of the adjustment under this section; or
<br>
<br>"(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the former participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in rates of pay of the Foreign Service Schedule under such section 403 during the period—
<br>
<br>"(i) beginning on the date the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant, the date the participant's annuity commenced), and
<br>
<br>"(ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under this section.
<br>
<br>"(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, 'pay' means the rate of salary or basic pay as payable under any provision of law, including any provision of law limiting the expenditure of appropriated funds.".
<br>
<br>(b) The amendment made by subsection (a) of this Section shall not cause any annuity to be reduced below the rate that is payable on the date of approval of this Order [Oct. 17, 1983], but shall apply to any adjustment occurring on or after April 1, 1983 under Section 826 of the Act [22 U.S.C. 4066] to any annuity payable from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund, whether such annuity has a commencing date before, on, or after the date of this Order.
