<br>
<br>(1) such services had been provided by a nongovernmental provider; and
<br>
<br>(2) such individual had been required to pay such charges or expenses and did pay such charges or expenses.

<br>
<br>(2) a no-fault automobile accident insurance plan or program.
<br>(c) Nonapplicability of other laws
<br>
<br>No law of any State, or of any political subdivision of a State and no provision of any contract, insurance or health maintenance organization policy, employee benefit plan, self-insurance plan, managed care plan, or other health care plan or program entered into or renewed after November 23, 1988, shall prevent or hinder the right of recovery of the United States, an Indian tribe, or tribal organization under subsection (a).

<br>(k) Savings
<br>
