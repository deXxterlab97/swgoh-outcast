<br>He deviseth wicked devices To destroy the poor with lying
<br>words,
<br>And the needy when he speaketh right.
<br>8But the liberal deviseth liberal things;
<br>And by liberal things shall he stand.
<br>
<br>9Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice;
<br>Ye confident daughters, give ear unto my speech.
<br>10After a year and days shall ye be troubled, ye confident women;
<br>For the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.
<br>11Tremble, ye women that are at ease;
<br>Be troubled, ye confident ones; Strip you, and make you bare,
<br>And gird sackcloth upon your loins,
<br>12Smiting upon the breasts
<br> 
<br>For the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine;
<br>13For the land of my people Whereon thorns and briers come up; Yea, for all the houses of joy
<br>And the joyous city.
<br>14For the palace shall be forsaken;
<br>The city with its stir shall be deserted;
<br>The mound and the tower shall be for dens for ever,
<br>A joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
<br>15Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high,
<br>And the wilderness become a fruitful field,
<br>And the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
<br>16Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness,
<br>And righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.
<br>17And the work of righteousness shall be peace;
<br>And the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever.
<br>18And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation,
<br>And in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.
<br>19And it shall hail, in the downfall of the forest;
<br>But the city shall descend into the valley.
<br>20Happy are ye that sow beside all waters,
<br>That send forth freely the feet of the ox and the ass.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled;
<br>And dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!
<br>When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
<br>And when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, be gracious unto us; We have waited for Thee;
<br>Be Thou their arm every morning,
<br>Our salvation also in the time of trouble.
<br>3At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled;
<br>At the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered.
<br>4And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth;
<br>As locusts leap do they leap upon it.
<br>5The LORD is exalted, for He dwelleth on high;
<br>He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
<br>6And the stability of thy times shall be
<br>A hoard of salvation—wisdom and knowledge,
<br>And the fear of the LORD which is His treasure.
<br>
<br>7Behold, their valiant ones cry without;
<br>The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
<br>8The highways lie waste,
<br> 
<br>The wayfaring man ceaseth; He hath broken the covenant, He hath despised the cities, He regardeth not man.
<br>9The land mourneth and languisheth;
<br>Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness;
<br>And Bashan and Carmel are clean bare.
<br>
<br>10Now will I arise, saith the LORD; Now will I be exalted;
<br>Now will I lift Myself up.
<br>11Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble;
<br>Your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
<br>12And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime;
<br>As thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
<br>
<br>13Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done;
<br>And, ye that are near, acknowledge My might.
<br>14The sinners in Zion are afraid; Trembling hath seized the ungodly: ‘Who among us shall dwell with the
<br>devouring fire?
<br>Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?’
<br>15He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly;
<br>He that despiseth the gain of oppressions,
<br>That shaketh his hands from holding of bribes,
<br> 
<br>That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood,
<br>And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;
<br>16He shall dwell on high;
<br>His place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks;
<br>His bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure.
<br>
<br>17Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty;
<br>They shall behold a land stretching afar.
<br>18Thy heart shall muse on the terror: ‘Where is he that counted, where is
<br>he that weighed?
<br>Where is he that counted the towers?’
<br>19Thou shalt not see the fierce people;
<br>A people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive,
<br>Of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand.
<br>20Look upon Zion, the city of our solemn gatherings;
<br>Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a peaceful habitation,
<br>A tent that shall not be removed,
<br>The stakes whereof shall never be plucked up,
<br>Neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
<br>21But there the LORD will be with us in majesty,
<br>In a place of broad rivers and streams;
<br> 
<br>Wherein shall go no galley with oars,
<br>Neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
<br>22For the LORD is our Judge, The LORD is our Lawgiver, The LORD is our King;
<br>He will save us.
<br>23Thy tacklings are loosed;
<br>They do not hold the stand of their mast,
<br>They do not spread the sail;
<br>Then is the prey of a great spoil divided;
<br>The lame take the prey.
<br>24And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I am sick’;
<br>The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
<br>
<br>Come near, ye nations, to hear, And attend, ye peoples;
<br>Let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof,
<br>The world, and all things that come forth of it.
<br>2For the LORD hath indignation against all the nations,
<br>And fury against all their host; He hath utterly destroyed them,
<br>He hath delivered them to the slaughter.
<br>3Their slain also shall be cast out,
<br>And the stench of their carcasses shall come up,
<br>And the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
<br>4And all the host of heaven shall moulder away,
<br> 
<br>And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll;
<br>And all their host shall fall down, As the leaf falleth off from the vine, And as a falling fig from the fig-
<br>tree.
<br>5For My sword hath drunk its fill in heaven;
<br>Behold, it shall come down upon Edom,
<br>And upon the people of My ban, to judgment.
<br>6The sword of the LORD is filled with blood,
<br>It is made fat with fatness,
<br>With the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For the LORD hath a sacrifice in
<br>Bozrah,
<br>And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
<br>7And the wild-oxen shall come down with them,
<br>And the bullocks with the bulls;
<br>And their land shall be drunken with blood,
<br>And their dust made fat with fatness.
<br>8For the LORD hath a day of vengeance,
<br>A year of recompense for the controversy of Zion.
<br>9And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch,
<br>And the dust thereof into brimstone,
<br>And the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
<br>10It shall not be quenched night nor day,
<br> 
<br>The smoke thereof shall go up for ever;
<br>From generation to generation it shall lie waste:
<br>None shall pass through it for ever and ever.
<br>11But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it,
<br>And the owl and the raven shall dwell therein;
<br>And He shall stretch over it The line of confusion, and the
<br>plummet of emptiness.
<br>12As for her nobles, none shall be there to be called to the kingdom;
<br>And all her princes shall be nothing.
<br>13And thorns shall come up in her palaces,
<br>Nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof;
<br>And it shall be a habitation of wild- dogs,
<br>An enclosure for ostriches.
<br>14And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals,
<br>And the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
<br>Yea, the night-monster shall repose there,
<br>And shall find her a place of rest.
<br>15There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay,
<br>And hatch, and brood under her shadow;
<br>Yea, there shall the kites be gathered,
<br>Every one with her mate.
<br>16Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read;
<br>No one of these shall be missing,
<br> 
<br>None shall want her mate;
<br>For My mouth it hath commanded,
<br>And the breath thereof it hath gathered them.
<br>17And He hath cast the lot for them,
<br>And His hand hath divided it unto them by line;
<br>They shall possess it for ever,
<br>From generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
<br>
<br>The	wilderness	and	the parched land shall be glad;
<br>And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
<br>2It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice,
<br>Even with joy and singing;
<br>The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,
<br>The excellency of Carmel and Sharon;
<br>They shall see the glory of the LORD, The excellency of our God.
<br>3Strengthen ye the weak hands, And make firm the tottering knees. 4Say to them that are of a fearful
<br>heart: ‘Be strong, fear not’;
<br>Behold, your God will come with vengeance,
<br>With the recompense of God He will come and save you.
<br>
<br>5Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
<br>And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
<br>6Then shall the lame man leap as a hart,
<br> 
<br>And the tongue of the dumb shall sing;
<br>For in the wilderness shall waters break out,
<br>And streams in the desert.
<br>7And the parched land shall become a pool,
<br>And the thirsty ground springs of water;
<br>In the habitation of jackals herds shall lie down,
<br>It shall be an enclosure for reeds and rushes.
<br>8And a highway shall be there, and a way,
<br>And it shall be called The way of holiness;
<br>The unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those;
<br>The wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.
<br>9No lion shall be there,
<br>Nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon,
<br>They shall not be found there;
<br>But the redeemed shall walk there;
<br>10And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,
<br>And come with singing unto Zion,
<br>And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;
<br>They shall obtain gladness and joy,
<br>And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
<br>
<br>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth	year	of	king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
<br> 
<br>fortified cities of Judah, and took them. 2And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers’field. 3Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. 4And Rab-shakeh said unto them: ‘Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 5I said: It is but vain words; for counsel and strength are for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me? 6Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him. 7But if thou say unto me: We trust in the LORD our God; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before this altar? 8Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 9How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my master’s servants? yet thou puttest thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! 10And am I now come up
<br> 
<br>without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said unto me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.’
<br>11Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh: ‘Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews’language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.’ 12But Rab-shakeh said: ‘Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?’ 13Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’language, and said: ‘Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 14Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you, for he will not be able to deliver you; 15neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying: The LORD will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 16Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 17until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 18Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying: The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of
<br> 
<br>the king of Assyria? 19Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 20Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’
<br>21But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying: ‘Answer him not.’ 22Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
<br>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he
<br>rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 2And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 3And they said unto him: ‘Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 4It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rab- shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the    LORD      thy    God    hath    heard;
<br> 
<br>wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.’ 5So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6And Isaiah said unto them: ‘Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 7Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’
<br>8So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 9And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: ‘He is come out to fight against thee.’ And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying: 10’Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 11Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? 12Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? 13Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’
<br> 
<br>14And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 15And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying: 16’O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. 17Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to taunt the living God. 18Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land, 19and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 20Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD, even Thou only.’
<br>21Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, 22this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him:
<br>The virgin daughter of Zion
<br>Hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn;
<br>The daughter of Jerusalem Hath shaken her head at thee. 23Whom hast thou taunted and
<br>blasphemed?
<br> 
<br>And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?
<br>Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high,
<br>Even against the Holy One of Israel!
<br>24By thy servants hast thou taunted the Lord,
<br>And hast said: With the multitude of my chariots
<br>Am I come up to the height of the mountains,
<br>To the innermost parts of Lebanon;
<br>And I have cut down the tall cedars thereof,
<br>And the choice cypress-trees thereof;
<br>And I have entered into his farthest height,
<br>The forest of his fruitful field.
<br>25I have digged and drunk water,
<br>And with the sole of my feet have I dried up
<br>All the rivers of Egypt. 26Hast thou not heard? Long ago I made it,
<br>In ancient times I fashioned it; Now have I brought it to pass, Yea, it is done; that fortified cities Should be laid waste into ruinous
<br>heaps.
<br>27Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,
<br>They were dismayed and confounded;
<br>They were as the grass of the field, And as the green herb,
<br>As the grass on the housetops,
<br>And as a field of corn before it is grown up.
<br> 
<br>
<br>28But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
<br>And thy raging against Me.
<br>29Because of thy raging against Me,
<br>And for that thine uproar is come up into Mine ears,
<br>Therefore will I put My hook in thy nose,
<br>And My bridle in thy lips,
<br>And I will turn thee back by the way By which thou camest.
<br>30And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 31And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 32For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this. 33Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it. 34By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD. 35For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’ 36And the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and
<br> 
<br>when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 37So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 38And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt	die,	and	not	live.’	2Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, 3and said: ‘Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.’ And Hezekiah wept sore. 4Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying: 5’Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. 6And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city. 7And this shall be the sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He hath spoken: 8behold, I will cause the shadow of the dial, which is gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to
<br> 
<br>return backward ten degrees.’ So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
<br>
<br>9The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
<br>10I said: In the noontide of my days I shall go,
<br>Even to the gates of the nether- world;
<br>I am deprived of the residue of my years.
<br>11I said: I shall not see the LORD,
<br>Even the LORD in the land of the living;
<br>I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
<br>12My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me
<br>As a shepherd’s tent;
<br>I have rolled up like a weaver my life;
<br>He will cut me off from the thrum;
<br>From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.
<br>13The more I make myself like unto a lion until morning,
<br>The more it breaketh all my bones;
<br>From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.
<br>14Like a swallow or a crane, so do I chatter,
<br>I do moan as a dove;
<br>Mine eyes fail with looking upward.
<br>O LORD, I am oppressed, be Thou my surety.
<br> 
<br>15What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me,
<br>And Himself hath done it;
<br>I shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.
<br>16O Lord, by these things men live,
<br>And altogether therein is the life of my spirit;
<br>Wherefore recover Thou me, and make me to live.
<br>17Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;
<br>But Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it
<br>From the pit of corruption;
<br>For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.
<br>
<br>18For the nether-world cannot praise Thee,
<br>Death cannot celebrate Thee; They that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.
<br>19The living, the living, he shall praise Thee,
<br>As I do this day;
<br>The father to the children shall make known Thy truth.
<br>20The LORD is ready to save me;
<br>Therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments
<br>All the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
<br>
<br>21And Isaiah said: ‘Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.’ 22And Hezekiah said.’ What is the sign
<br> 
<br>that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?’
<br>At that time Merodach- baladan the son of Baladan,
<br>king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. 2And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. 3Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him: ‘What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?’ And Hezekiah said: ‘They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.’ 4Then said he: ‘What have they seen in thy house?’ And Hezekiah answered: ‘All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.’ 5Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah: ‘Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 6Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 7And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ 8Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: ‘Good is the word of the LORD which
<br> 
<br>thou hast spoken.’ He said moreover: ‘If but there shall be peace and truth in my days.’
<br>
<br>Comfort ye, comfort ye My people,
<br>Saith your God.
<br>2Bid Jerusalem take heart, And proclaim unto her,
<br>That her time of service is accomplished,
<br>That her guilt is paid off; That she hath received of the
<br>LORD’S hand Double for all her sins.
<br>
<br>3Hark! one calleth:
<br>‘Clear ye in the wilderness the way of the LORD,
<br>Make plain in the desert A highway for our God.
<br>4Every valley shall be lifted up,
<br>And every mountain and hill shall be made low;
<br>And the rugged shall be made level, And the rough places a plain;
<br>5And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,
<br>And all flesh shall see it together;
<br>For the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.’
<br>
<br>6Hark! one saith: ‘Proclaim! ’
<br>And he saith: ‘What shall I proclaim?’
<br>’All flesh is grass,
<br>And all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field;
<br> 
<br>7The grass withereth, the flower fadeth;
<br>Because the breath of the LORD bloweth upon it—
<br>Surely the people is grass.
<br>8The grass withereth, the flower fadeth;
<br>But the word of our God shall stand for ever.’
<br>
<br>9O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,
<br>Get thee up into the high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to
<br>Jerusalem,
<br>Lift up thy voice with strength; Lift it up, be not afraid;
<br>Say unto the cities of Judah: ‘Behold your God! ’
<br>10Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a Mighty One,
<br>And His arm will rule for Him; Behold, His reward is with Him, And His recompense before Him. 11Even as a shepherd that feedeth his
<br>flock,
<br>That gathereth the lambs in his arm, And carrieth them in his bosom,
<br>And gently leadeth those that give suck.
<br>
<br>12Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
<br>And meted out heaven with the span,
<br>And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
<br>And weighed the mountains in scales,
<br> 
<br>And the hills in a balance?
<br>13Who hath meted out the spirit of the LORD?
<br>Or who was His counsellor that he might instruct Him?
<br>14With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him,
<br>And taught Him in the path of right, And taught Him knowledge,
<br>And made Him to know the way of discernment?
<br>15Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket,
<br>And are counted as the small dust of the balance;
<br>Behold the isles are as a mote in weight.
<br>16And Lebanon is not sufficient fuel,
<br>Nor the beasts thereof sufficient for burnt-offerings.
<br>17All the nations are as nothing before Him;
<br>They are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity.
<br>18To whom then will ye liken God?
<br>Or what likeness will ye compare unto Him?
<br>19The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted,
<br>And the goldsmith spread over with gold,
<br>The silversmith casting silver chains?
<br>20A holm-oak is set apart,
<br>He chooseth a tree that will not rot;
<br>He seeketh unto him a cunning craftsman
<br>To set up an image, that shall not be moved.
<br> 
<br>
<br>21Know ye not? hear ye not?
<br>Hath it not been told you from the beginning?
<br>Have ye not understood the foundations of the earth?
<br>22It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth,
<br>And the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;
<br>That stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,
<br>And spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;
<br>23That bringeth princes to nothing;
<br>He maketh the judges of the earth as a thing of nought.
<br>24Scarce are they planted, Scarce are they sown,
<br>Scarce hath their stock taken root in the earth;
<br>When He bloweth upon them, they wither,
<br>And the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.
<br>25To whom then will ye liken Me, that I should be equal?
<br>Saith the Holy One.
<br>26Lift up your eyes on high,
<br>And see: who hath created these?
<br>He that bringeth out their host by number,
<br>He calleth them all by name;
<br>By the greatness of His might, and for that He is strong in power,
<br>Not one faileth.
<br>
<br>27Why sayest thou, O Jacob, And speakest, O Israel:
<br> 
<br>‘My way is hid from the LORD,
<br>And my right is passed over from my God’?
<br>28Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard
<br>That the everlasting God, the LORD, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Fainteth not, neither is weary?
<br>His discernment is past searching out.
<br>29He giveth power to the faint;
<br>And to him that hath no might He increaseth strength.
<br>30Even the youths shall faint and be weary,
<br>And the young men shall utterly fall;
<br>31But they that wait for the LORD shall renew their strength;
<br>They shall mount up with wings as eagles;
<br>They shall run, and not be weary; They shall walk, and not faint.
<br>
<br>Keep silence before Me, O islands,
<br>And let the peoples renew their strength;
<br>Let them draw near, then let them speak;
<br>Let us come near together to judgment.
<br>2Who hath raised up one from the east,
<br>At whose steps victory attendeth? He giveth nations before him, And maketh him rule over kings;
<br>His sword maketh them as the dust, His bow as the driven stubble.
<br> 
<br>3He pursueth them, and passeth on safely;
<br>The way with his feet he treadeth not.
<br>4Who hath wrought and done it?
<br>He that called the generations from the beginning.
<br>I, the LORD, who am the first, And with the last am the same. 5The isles saw, and feared;
<br>The ends of the earth trembled; They drew near, and came.
<br>
<br>6They helped every one his neighbour;
<br>And every one said to his brother: ‘Be of good courage.’
<br>7So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith,
<br>And he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil,
<br>Saying of the soldering: ‘It is good’;
<br>And he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
<br>
<br>8But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
<br>The seed of Abraham My friend;
<br>9Thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
<br>And called thee from the uttermost parts thereof,
<br>And said unto thee: ‘Thou art My servant,
<br>I have chosen thee and not cast thee away’;
<br>10Fear thou not, for I am with thee, Be not dismayed, for I am thy God;
<br> 
<br>I strengthen thee, yea, I help thee;
<br>Yea, I uphold thee with My victorious right hand.
<br>11Behold, all they that were incensed against thee
<br>Shall be ashamed and confounded; They that strove with thee
<br>Shall be as nothing, and shall perish.
<br>12Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them,
<br>Even them that contended with thee; They that warred against thee
<br>Shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
<br>13For I the LORD thy God Hold thy right hand,
<br>Who say unto thee: ‘Fear not, I help thee.’
<br>
<br>14Fear not, thou worm Jacob, And ye men of Israel;
<br>I help thee, saith the LORD,
<br>And thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
<br>15Behold, I make thee a new threshing-sledge
<br>Having sharp teeth;
<br>Thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small,
<br>And shalt make the hills as chaff.
<br>16Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away,
<br>And the whirlwind shall scatter them;
<br>And thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, Thou shalt glory in the Holy One of
<br>Israel.
<br> 
<br>17The poor and needy seek water and there is none,
<br>And their tongue faileth for thirst; I the LORD will answer them,
<br>I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
<br>18I will open rivers on the high hills,
<br>And fountains in the midst of the valleys;
<br>I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
<br>And the dry land springs of water.
<br>19I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia-tree,
<br>And the myrtle, and the oil-tree;
<br>I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane-tree, and the larch together;
<br>20That they may see, and know,
<br>And consider, and understand together,
<br>That the hand of the LORD hath done this,
<br>And the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
<br>
<br>21Produce your cause, saith the LORD;
<br>Bring forth your reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
<br>22Let them bring them forth, and declare unto us
<br>The things that shall happen;
<br>The former things, what are they? Declare ye, that we may consider, And know the end of them;
<br>Or announce to us things to come.
<br>23Declare the things that are to come hereafter,
<br> 
<br>That we may know that ye are gods; Yea, do good, or do evil,
<br>That we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
<br>24Behold, ye are nothing,
<br>And your work a thing of nought;
<br>An abomination is he that chooseth you.
<br>
<br>25I have roused up one from the north, and he is come,
<br>From the rising of the sun one that calleth upon My name;
<br>And he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar,
<br>And as the potter treadeth clay.
<br>26Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know?
<br>And beforetime, that we may say that he is right?
<br>Yea, there is none that declareth, Yea, there is none that announceth,
<br>Yea, there is none that heareth your utterances.
<br>27A harbinger unto Zion will I give: ‘Behold, behold them’,
<br>And to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings.
<br>28And I look, but there is no man;
<br>Even among them, but there is no counsellor,
<br>That, when I ask of them, can give an answer.
<br>29Behold, all of them,
<br>Their works are vanity and nought;
<br>Their molten images are wind and confusion.
<br> 
<br>Behold My servant, whom I uphold;
<br>Mine elect, in whom My soul delighteth;
<br>I have put My spirit upon him,
<br>He shall make the right to go forth to the nations.
<br>2He shall not cry, nor lift up,
<br>Nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
<br>3A bruised reed shall he not break,
<br>And the dimly burning wick shall he not quench;
<br>He shall make the right to go forth according to the truth.
<br>4He shall not fail nor be crushed,
<br>Till he have set the right in the earth;
<br>And the isles shall wait for his teaching.
<br>5Thus saith God the LORD,
<br>He that created the heavens, and stretched them forth,
<br>He that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it,
<br>He that giveth breath unto the people upon it,
<br>And spirit to them that walk therein:
<br>6I the LORD have called thee in righteousness,
<br>And have taken hold of thy hand,
<br>And kept thee, and set thee for a covenant of the people,
<br>For a light of the nations;
<br>7To open the blind eyes,
<br>To bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
<br>And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
<br> 
<br>8I am the LORD, that is My name;
<br>And My glory will I not give to another,
<br>Neither My praise to graven images.
<br>9Behold, the former things are come to pass,
<br>And new things do I declare;
<br>Before they spring forth I tell you of them.
<br>10Sing unto the LORD a new song,
<br>And His praise from the end of the earth;
<br>Ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein,
<br>The isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
<br>11Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
<br>The villages that Kedar doth inhabit; Let the inhabitants of Sela exult,
<br>Let them shout from the top of the mountains.
<br>12Let them give glory unto the LORD,
<br>And declare His praise in the islands.
<br>13The LORD will go forth as a mighty man,
<br>He will stir up jealousy like a man of war;
<br>He will cry, yea, He will shout aloud,
<br>He will prove Himself mighty against His enemies.
<br>
<br>14I have long time held My peace, I have been still, and refrained
<br>Myself;
<br>Now will I cry like a travailing woman,
<br> 
<br>Gasping and panting at once.
<br>15I will make waste mountains and hills,
<br>And dry up all their herbs;
<br>And I will make the rivers islands, And will dry up the pools.
<br>16And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not,
<br>In paths that they knew not will I lead them;
<br>I will make darkness light before them, and rugged places plain.
<br>These things will I do,
<br>And I will not leave them undone.
<br>17They shall be turned back, greatly ashamed,
<br>That trust in graven images, That say unto molten images: ‘Ye are our gods.’
<br>
<br>18Hear, ye deaf,
<br>And look, ye blind, that ye may see.
<br>19Who is blind, but My servant?
<br>Or deaf, as My messenger that I send?
<br>Who is blind as he that is wholehearted,
<br>And blind as the LORD’S servant?
<br>20Seeing many things, thou observest not;
<br>Opening the ears, he heareth not.
<br>21The LORD was pleased, for His righteousness’sake,
<br>To make the teaching great and glorious.
<br>22But this is a people robbed and spoiled,
<br>They are all of them snared in holes, And they are hid in prison-houses;
<br> 
<br>They are for a prey, and none delivereth,
<br>For a spoil, and none saith: ‘Restore.’
<br>23Who among you will give ear to this? Who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
<br>24Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?
<br>Did not the LORD?
<br>He against whom we have sinned,
<br>And in whose ways they would not walk,
<br>Neither were they obedient unto His law.
<br>25Therefore He poured upon him the fury of His anger,
<br>And the strength of battle;
<br>And it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not,
<br>And it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
<br>
<br>But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob,
<br>And He that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee,
<br>I have called thee by thy name, thou art Mine.
<br>2When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee,
<br>And through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee;
<br>When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned,
<br>Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
<br>3For I am the LORD thy God,
<br>The Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour;
<br> 
<br>I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
<br>4Since thou art precious in My sight, and honourable,
<br>And I have loved thee;
<br>Therefore will I give men for thee, And peoples for thy life.
<br>5Fear not, for I am with thee;
<br>I will bring thy seed from the east, And gather thee from the west;
<br>6I will say to the north: ‘Give up’, And to the south: ‘Keep not back, Bring My sons from far,
<br>And My daughters from the end of the earth;
<br>7Every one that is called by My name,
<br>And whom I have created for My glory,
<br>I have formed him, yea, I have made him.’
<br>8The blind people that have eyes shall be brought forth,
<br>And the deaf that have ears.
<br>9All the nations are gathered together,
<br>And the peoples are assembled; Who among them can declare this, And announce to us former things?
<br>Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified;
<br>And let them hear, and say: ‘It is truth.’
<br>10Ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD,
<br>And My servant whom I have chosen;
<br>That ye may know and believe Me, and understand
<br> 
<br>That I am He;
<br>Before Me there was no God formed,
<br>Neither shall any be after Me.
<br>
<br>11I, even I, am the LORD;
<br>And beside Me there is no saviour. 12I have declared, and I have saved, And I have announced,
<br>And there was no strange god among you;
<br>Therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and I am God.
<br>13Yea, since the day was I am He,
<br>And there is none that can deliver out of My hand;
<br>I will work, and who can reverse it?
<br>
<br>14Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer,
<br>The Holy One of Israel:
<br>For your sake I have sent to Babylon,
<br>And I will bring down all of them as fugitives,
<br>Even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their shouting.
<br>15I am the LORD, your Holy One, The Creator of Israel, your King.
<br>
<br>16Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a way in the sea,
<br>And a path in the mighty waters;
<br>17Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse,
<br>The army and the power—
<br>They lie down together, they shall not rise,
<br> 
<br>They are extinct, they are quenched as a wick:
<br>18Remember ye not the former things,
<br>Neither consider the things of old.
<br>19Behold, I will do a new thing;
<br>Now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it?
<br>I will even make a way in the wilderness,
<br>And rivers in the desert.
<br>20The beasts of the field shall honour Me,
<br>The jackals and the ostriches;
<br>Because I give waters in the wilderness,
<br>And rivers in the desert,
<br>To give drink to My people, Mine elect;
<br>21The people which I formed for Myself,
<br>That they might tell of My praise.
<br>
<br>22Yet thou hast not called upon Me, O Jacob,
<br>Neither hast thou wearied thyself about Me, O Israel.
<br>23Thou hast not brought Me the small cattle of thy burnt- offerings;
<br>Neither hast thou honoured Me with thy sacrifices.
<br>I have not burdened thee with a meal-offering,
<br>Nor wearied thee with frankincense.
<br>24Thou hast bought Me no sweet cane with money,
<br>Neither hast thou satisfied Me with the fat of thy sacrifices;
<br> 
<br>But thou hast burdened Me with thy sins,
<br>Thou hast wearied Me with thine iniquities.
<br>25I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake;
<br>And thy sins I will not remember.
<br>26Put Me in remembrance, let us plead together;
<br>Declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
<br>27Thy first father sinned,
<br>And thine intercessors have transgressed against Me.
<br>28Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary,
<br>And I have given Jacob to condemnation,
<br>And Israel to reviling.
<br>
<br>Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant,
<br>And Israel, whom I have chosen; 2Thus saith the LORD that made thee, And formed thee from the womb,
<br>who will help thee:
<br>Fear not, O Jacob My servant,
<br>And thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
<br>3For I will pour water upon the thirsty land,
<br>And streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed,
<br>And My blessing upon thine offspring;
<br>4And they shall spring up among the grass,
<br>As willows by the watercourses.
<br> 
<br>5One shall say: ‘I am the LORD’S’;
<br>And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob;
<br>And another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD,
<br>And surname himself by the name of Israel.
<br>
<br>6Thus saith the LORD, the King of Israel,
<br>And his Redeemer the LORD of hosts:
<br>I am the first, and I am the last, And beside Me there is no God. 7And who, as I, can proclaim—
<br>Let him declare it, and set it in order for Me—
<br>Since I appointed the ancient people?
<br>And the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare.
<br>8Fear ye not, neither be afraid;
<br>Have I not announced unto thee of old, and declared it?
<br>And ye are My witnesses. Is there a God beside Me?
<br>Yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.
<br>
<br>9They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity,
<br>And their delectable things shall not profit;
<br>And their own witnesses see not, nor know;
<br>That they may be ashamed.
<br>10Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image
<br> 
<br>That is profitable for nothing?
<br>11Behold, all the fellows thereof shall be ashamed;
<br>And the craftsmen skilled above men;
<br>Let them all be gathered together, let them stand up;
<br>They shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.
<br>
<br>12The smith maketh an axe,
<br>And worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers,
<br>And worketh it with his strong arm;
<br>Yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth;
<br>He drinketh no water, and is faint. 13The carpenter stretcheth out a line; He marketh it out with a pencil;
<br>He fitteth it with planes,
<br>And he marketh it out with the compasses,
<br>And maketh it after the figure of a man,
<br>According to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house.
<br>14He heweth him down cedars, And taketh the ilex and the oak,
<br>And strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest;
<br>He planteth a bay-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.
<br>15Then a man useth it for fuel;
<br>And he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself;
<br>Yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread;
<br>Yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it;
<br> 
<br>He maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
<br>16He burneth the half thereof in the fire;
<br>With the half thereof he eateth flesh; He roasteth roast, and is satisfied; Yea, he warmeth himself, and saith:
<br>‘Aha,
<br>I am warm, I have seen the fire’;
<br>17And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image;
<br>He falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it,
<br>And saith: ‘Deliver me, for thou art my god.’
<br>
<br>18They know not, neither do they understand;
<br>For their eyes are bedaubed, that they cannot see,
<br>And their hearts, that they cannot understand.
<br>19And none considereth in his heart,
<br>Neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say:
<br>‘I have burned the half of it in the fire;
<br>Yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof;
<br>I have roasted flesh and eaten it;
<br>And shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?
<br>Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?’
<br>20He striveth after ashes,
<br>A deceived heart hath turned him aside,
<br>That he cannot deliver his soul, nor say:
<br> 
<br>‘Is there not a lie in my right hand?’
<br>
<br>21Remember these things, O Jacob, And Israel, for thou art My servant;
<br>I have formed thee, thou art Mine own servant;
<br>O Israel, thou shouldest not forget Me.
<br>22I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions,
<br>And, as a cloud, thy sins;
<br>Return unto Me, for I have redeemed thee.
<br>23Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD hath done it;
<br>Shout, ye lowest parts of the earth;
<br>Break forth into singing, ye mountains,
<br>O forest, and every tree therein; For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, And doth glorify Himself in Israel.
<br>
<br>24Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer,
<br>And He that formed thee from the womb:
<br>I am the LORD, that maketh all things;
<br>That stretched forth the heavens alone;
<br>That spread abroad the earth by Myself;
<br>25That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters,
<br>And maketh diviners mad;
<br>That turneth wise men backward,
<br>And maketh their knowledge foolish;
<br> 
<br>26That confirmeth the word of His servant,
<br>And performeth the counsel of His messengers;
<br>That saith of Jerusalem: ‘She shall be inhabited’;
<br>And of the cities of Judah: ‘They shall be built,
<br>And I will raise up the waste places thereof’;
<br>27That saith to the deep: ‘Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers’; 28That saith of Cyrus: ‘He is My
<br>shepherd,
<br>And shall perform all My pleasure’;
<br>Even saying of Jerusalem: ‘She shall be built’;
<br>And to the temple: ‘My foundation shall be laid.’
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD to His anointed,
<br>To Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden,
<br>To subdue nations before him, And to loose the loins of kings; To open the doors before him,
<br>And that the gates may not be shut:
<br>2I will go before thee,
<br>And make the crooked places straight;
<br>I will break in pieces the doors of brass,
<br>And cut in sunder the bars of iron;
<br>3And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,
<br>And hidden riches of secret places, That thou mayest know that I am the
<br>LORD,
<br> 
<br>Who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel.
<br>4For the sake of Jacob My servant, And Israel Mine elect,
<br>I have called thee by thy name,
<br>I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me.
<br>5I am the LORD, and there is none else,
<br>Beside Me there is no God;
<br>I have girded thee, though thou hast not known Me;
<br>6That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
<br>That there is none beside Me;
<br>I am the LORD; and there is none else;
<br>7I form the light, and create darkness;
<br>I make peace, and create evil;
<br>I am the LORD, that doeth all these things.
<br>
<br>8Drop down, ye heavens, from above,
<br>And let the skies pour down righteousness;
<br>Let the earth open, that they may bring forth salvation,
<br>And let her cause righteousness to spring up together;
<br>I the LORD have created it.
<br>
<br>9Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker,
<br>As a potsherd with the potsherds of the earth!
<br> 
<br>Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it: ‘What makest thou?’
<br>Or: ‘Thy work, it hath no hands’? 10Woe unto him that saith unto his father.’ Wherefore begettest
<br>thou?’
<br>Or to a woman: ‘Wherefore travailest thou?’
<br>
<br>11Thus saith the LORD,
<br>The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:
<br>Ask Me of the things that are to come;
<br>Concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands, command ye Me.
<br>12I, even I, have made the earth, And created man upon it;
<br>I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens,
<br>And all their host have I commanded.
<br>13I have roused him up in victory, And I make level all his ways; He shall build My city,
<br>And he shall let Mine exiles go free, Not for price nor reward,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>
<br>14Thus saith the LORD:
<br>The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia,
<br>And of the Sabeans, men of stature,
<br>Shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine;
<br>They shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over;
<br>And they shall fall down unto thee,
<br> 
<br>They shall make supplication unto thee:
<br>Surely God is in thee, and there is none else,
<br>There is no other God.
<br>15Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself,
<br>O God of Israel, the Saviour. 16They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them;
<br>They shall go in confusion together that are makers of idols.
<br>17O Israel, that art saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation;
<br>Ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.
<br>
<br>18For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens,
<br>He is God;
<br>That formed the earth and made it, He established it,
<br>He created it not a waste, He formed it to be inhabited:
<br>I am the LORD, and there is none else.
<br>19I have not spoken in secret,
<br>In a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob: ‘Seek ye Me in vain’;
<br>I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
<br>20Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together,
<br>Ye that are escaped of the nations;
<br>They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image,
<br>And pray unto a god that cannot save.
<br> 
<br>21Declare ye, and bring them near, Yea, let them take counsel together:
<br>Who hath announced this from ancient time,
<br>And declared it of old? Have not I the LORD?
<br>And there is no God else beside Me, A just God and a Saviour;
<br>There is none beside Me.
<br>22Look unto Me, and be ye saved, All the ends of the earth;
<br>For I am God, and there is none else.
<br>23By Myself have I sworn,
<br>The word is gone forth from My mouth in righteousness,
<br>And shall not come back,
<br>That unto Me every knee shall bow, Every tongue shall swear.
<br>24Only in the LORD, shall one say of Me, is victory and strength;
<br>Even to Him shall men come in confusion,
<br>All they that were incensed against Him.
<br>25In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel
<br>Be justified, and shall glory.
<br>
<br>Bel	boweth	down,	Nebo stoopeth;
<br>Their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle;
<br>The things that ye carried about are made a load,
<br>A burden to the weary beast.
<br>2They stoop, they bow down together,
<br>They could not deliver the burden;
<br> 
<br>And themselves are gone into captivity.
<br>3Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob,
<br>And all the remnant of the house of Israel,
<br>That are borne [by Me] from the birth,
<br>That are carried from the womb:
<br>4Even to old age I am the same,
<br>And even to hoar hairs will I carry you;
<br>I have made, and I will bear;
<br>Yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
<br>
<br>5To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal,
<br>And compare Me, that we may be like?
<br>6Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance;
<br>Ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god,
<br>To fall down thereto, yea, to worship.
<br>7He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried,
<br>And set in his place, and he standeth,
<br>From his place he doth not remove;
<br>Yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer,
<br>Nor save him out of his trouble.
<br>
<br>8Remember this, and stand fast; Bring it to mind, O ye transgressors. 9Remember the former things of
<br>old:
<br> 
<br>That I am God, and there is none else;
<br>I am God, and there is none like Me;
<br>10Declaring the end from the beginning,
<br>And from ancient times things that are not yet done;
<br>Saying: ‘My counsel shall stand, And all My pleasure will I do’; 11Calling a bird of prey from the
<br>east,
<br>The man of My counsel from a far country;
<br>Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass,
<br>I have purposed, I will also do it.
<br>
<br>12Hearken unto Me, ye stout- hearted,
<br>That are far from righteousness:
<br>13I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off,
<br>And My salvation shall not tarry; And I will place salvation in Zion For Israel My glory.
<br>
<br>Come down, and sit in the dust,
<br>O virgin daughter of Babylon,
<br>Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans;
<br>For thou shalt no more be called Tender and delicate.
<br>2Take the millstones, and grind meal;
<br>Remove thy veil,
<br>Strip off the train, uncover the leg, Pass through the rivers.
<br>3Thy nakedness shall be uncovered,
<br> 
<br>Yea, thy shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance,
<br>And will let no man intercede.
<br>4Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name,
<br>The Holy One of Israel.
<br>5Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness,
<br>O daughter of the Chaldeans; For thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.
<br>6I was wroth with My people, I profaned Mine inheritance, And gave them into thy hand;
<br>Thou didst show them no mercy;
<br>Upon the aged hast thou very heavily
<br>Laid thy yoke.
<br>7And thou saidst:
<br>‘For ever shall I be mistress’;
<br>So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart,
<br>Neither didst remember the end thereof.
<br>
<br>8Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures,
<br>That sittest securely, That sayest in thy heart:
<br>‘I am, and there is none else beside me;
<br>I shall not sit as a widow,
<br>Neither shall I know the loss of children’;
<br>9But these two things shall come to thee in a moment
<br>In one day, the loss of children, and widow-hood;
<br> 
<br>In their full measure shall they come upon thee,
<br>For the multitude of thy sorceries,
<br>And the great abundance of thine enchantments.
<br>
<br>10And thou hast been secure in thy wickedness,
<br>Thou hast said: ‘None seeth me’; Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, It hath perverted thee;
