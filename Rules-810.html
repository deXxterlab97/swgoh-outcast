<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 684; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, §17b, 65 Stat. 717.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §550 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §332, 35 Stat. 1152).
<br>
<br>Section 2(a) comprises section 550 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of phraseology.
<br>
<br>Section 2(b) is added to permit the deletion from many sections throughout the revision of such phrases as "causes or procures".
<br>
<br>The section as revised makes clear the legislative intent to punish as a principal not only one who directly commits an offense and one who "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures" another to commit an offense, but also anyone who causes the doing of an act which if done by him directly would render him guilty of an offense against the United States.
<br>
<br>It removes all doubt that one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise but causes the commission of an indispensable element of the offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality, is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.
<br>
<br>This accords with the following decisions: Rothenburg v. United States, 1918, 38 S. Ct. 18, 245 U.S. 480, 62 L. Ed. 414, and United States v. Hodorowicz, C. C. A. Ill. 1939, 105 F. 2d 218, certiorari denied, 60 S. Ct. 108, 308 U.S. 584, 84 L. Ed. 489. United States v. Giles, 1937, 57 S. Ct. 340, 300 U.S. 41, 81 L. Ed. 493, rehearing denied, 57 S. Ct. 505, 300 U.S. 687, 81 L. Ed. 888.

<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §551 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §333, 35 Stat. 1152).
<br>
<br>The first paragraph is new. It is based upon authority of Skelly v. United States (C. C. A. Okl. 1935, 76 F. 2d 483, certiorari denied, 1935, 55 S. Ct. 914, 295 U.S. 757, 79 L. Ed. 1699), where the court defined an accessory after the fact as—
<br>
<br>one who knowing a felony to have been committed by another, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon in order to hinder the felon's apprehension, trial, or punishment—
<br>
<br>and cited Jones' Blackstone, books 3 and 4, page 2204; U.S. v. Hartwell (Fed. Cas. No. 15,318); Albritton v. State (32 Fla. 358, 13 So. 955); State v. Davis (14 R. I. 281); Schleeter v. Commonwealth (218 Ky. 72, 290 S. W. 1075). (See also State v. Potter, 1942, 221 N. C. 153, 19 S. E. 2d 257; Hunter v. State, 1935, 128 Tex. Cr. R. 191, 79 S. W. 2d 855; State v. Wells, 1940, 195 La. 754, 197 So. 419.)
<br>
<br>The second paragraph is from section 551 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Here only slight changes were made in phraseology.

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§39, 133, 346, 381, 502, and 632, and section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XIII, §1, 40 Stat. 231).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates the first sentence of section 39, all of sections 133, 346, and 632, and the second sentences, respectively, of sections 381 and 502, all of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense, with minor changes in phraseology.
<br>
<br>All of these sections and parts of sections were derived from section 1 of title XIII of said act of June 15, 1917. Said section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., War and National Defense, has also been retained in that title, as it still relates to some sections therein which were not transferred to this title.
<br>
<br>The remainder of said section 39 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from sections 2, 3, and 4 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, relating to jurisdiction and other matters, is almost entirely obsolete. The provisions still in force are incorporated in section 3241 of this title.
<br>
<br>The remaining provisions of said sections 381 and 502 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 1 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 1364 and 2275 of this title.

<br>§6. Department and agency defined
<br>
<br>As used in this title:
<br>
<br>The term "department" means one of the executive departments enumerated in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government.
<br>
<br>The term "agency" includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This section defines the terms "department" and "agency" of the United States. The word "department" appears 57 times in title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the word "agency" 14 times. It was considered necessary to define clearly these words in order to avoid possible litigation as to the scope or coverage of a given section containing such words. (See United States v. Germaine, 1878, 99 U.S. 508, 25 L. Ed. 482, for definition of words "department" or "head of department.")
<br>
<br>The phrase "corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest" is intended to include those governmental corporations in which stock is not actually issued, as well as those in which stock is owned by the United States. It excludes those corporations in which the interest of the Government is custodial or incidental.

<br>§7. Special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States defined
<br>
<br>The term "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States", as used in this title, includes:
<br>
<br>(1) The high seas, any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, and any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, when such vessel is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State.
<br>
<br>(2) Any vessel registered, licensed, or enrolled under the laws of the United States, and being on a voyage upon the waters of any of the Great Lakes, or any of the waters connecting them, or upon the Saint Lawrence River where the same constitutes the International Boundary Line.
<br>
<br>(3) Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building.
<br>
<br>(4) Any island, rock, or key containing deposits of guano, which may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States.
<br>
<br>(5) Any aircraft belonging in whole or in part to the United States, or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, district, or possession thereof, while such aircraft is in flight over the high seas, or over any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State.
<br>
<br>(6) Any vehicle used or designed for flight or navigation in space and on the registry of the United States pursuant to the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies and the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, while that vehicle is in flight, which is from the moment when all external doors are closed on Earth following embarkation until the moment when one such door is opened on Earth for disembarkation or in the case of a forced landing, until the competent authorities take over the responsibility for the vehicle and for persons and property aboard.
<br>
<br>(7) Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States.
<br>
<br>(8) To the extent permitted by international law, any foreign vessel during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a national of the United States.
<br>
<br>(9) With respect to offenses committed by or against a national of the United States as that term is used in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act—
<br>
<br>(A) the premises of United States diplomatic, consular, military or other United States Government missions or entities in foreign States, including the buildings, parts of buildings, and land appurtenant or ancillary thereto or used for purposes of those missions or entities, irrespective of ownership; and
<br>
<br>(B) residences in foreign States and the land appurtenant or ancillary thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for purposes of those missions or entities or used by United States personnel assigned to those missions or entities.
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to supersede any treaty or international agreement with which this paragraph conflicts. This paragraph does not apply with respect to an offense committed by a person described in section 3261(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685; July 12, 1952, ch. 695, 66 Stat. 589; Pub. L. 97–96, §6, Dec. 21, 1981, 95 Stat. 1210; Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §1210, Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2164; Pub. L. 103–322, title XII, §120002, Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2021; Pub. L. 107–56, title VIII, §804, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 377.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §451 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §272, 35 Stat. 1142; June 11, 1940, ch. 323, 54 Stat. 304).
<br>
<br>The words "The term 'special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States' as used in this title includes:" were substituted for the words "The crimes and offenses defined in sections 451–468 of this title shall be punished as herein prescribed."
<br>
<br>This section first appeared in the 1909 Criminal Code. It made it possible to combine in one chapter all the penal provisions covering acts within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction without the necessity of repeating in each section the places covered.
<br>
<br>The present section has made possible the allocation of the diverse provisions of chapter 11 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to particular chapters restricted to particular offenses, as contemplated by the alphabetical chapter arrangement.
<br>
<br>In several revised sections of said chapter 11 the words "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" have been added. Thus the jurisdictional limitation will be preserved in all sections of said chapter 11 describing an offense.
<br>
<br>Enumeration of names of Great Lakes was omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Other minor changes were necessary now that the section defines a term rather than the place of commission of crime or offense; however, the extent of the special jurisdiction as originally enacted has been carefully followed.
