<br>
<br>(2)(A) The interest that the United States is entitled to recover under subsection (a) is the interest for the period (if any) described in subparagraph (B) at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent rates of ninety-one-day Treasury bills auctioned during that period.
<br>
<br>(B) The period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the period beginning—
<br>
<br>(i) if notice is provided as prescribed by subsection (b), 191 days after the date on which such sale, transfer, or cessation of use occurs, or

<br>The right of recovery of the United States under subsection (a) shall not, prior to judgment, constitute a lien on any facility.

<br>§238p. Recommendations and guidelines regarding automated external defibrillators for Federal buildings
<br>(a) Guidelines on placement
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish guidelines with respect to placing automated external defibrillator devices in Federal buildings. Such guidelines shall take into account the extent to which such devices may be used by lay persons, the typical number of employees and visitors in the buildings, the extent of the need for security measures regarding the buildings, buildings or portions of buildings in which there are special circumstances such as high electrical voltage or extreme heat or cold, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
<br>(b) Related recommendations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the recommendations of the Secretary on the appropriate implementation of the placement of automated external defibrillator devices under subsection (a), including procedures for the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Implementing appropriate training courses in the use of such devices, including the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
<br>
<br>(2) Proper maintenance and testing of the devices.
<br>
<br>(3) Ensuring coordination with appropriate licensed professionals in the oversight of training of the devices.
<br>
<br>(4) Ensuring coordination with local emergency medical systems regarding the placement and incidents of use of the devices.
<br>(c) Consultations; consideration of certain recommendations
<br>
<br>In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) consult with appropriate public and private entities;
<br>
<br>(2) consider the recommendations of national and local public-health organizations for improving the survival rates of individuals who experience cardiac arrest in nonhospital settings by minimizing the time elapsing between the onset of cardiac arrest and the initial medical response, including defibrillation as necessary; and
<br>
<br>(3) consult with and counsel other Federal agencies where such devices are to be used.
<br>(d) Date certain for establishing guidelines and recommendations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall comply with this section not later than 180 days after November 13, 2000.
<br>(e) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "automated external defibrillator device" has the meaning given such term in section 238q of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "Federal building" includes a building or portion of a building leased or rented by a Federal agency, and includes buildings on military installations of the United States.
<br>
<br>(July 1, 1944, ch. 373, title II, §247, as added Pub. L. 106–505, title IV, §403, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2337.)
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–505, title IV, §402, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2336, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Over 700 lives are lost every day to sudden cardiac arrest in the United States alone.
<br>
<br>"(2) Two out of every three sudden cardiac deaths occur before a victim can reach a hospital.
<br>
<br>"(3) More than 95 percent of these cardiac arrest victims will die, many because of lack of readily available life saving medical equipment.
<br>
<br>"(4) With current medical technology, up to 30 percent of cardiac arrest victims could be saved if victims had access to immediate medical response, including defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
<br>
<br>"(5) Once a victim has suffered a cardiac arrest, every minute that passes before returning the heart to a normal rhythm decreases the chance of survival by 10 percent.
<br>
<br>"(6) Most cardiac arrests are caused by abnormal heart rhythms called ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions, causing a chaotic rhythm that prevents the heart from pumping oxygen to the victim's brain and body.
<br>
<br>"(7) Communities that have implemented programs ensuring widespread public access to defibrillators, combined with appropriate training, maintenance, and coordination with local emergency medical systems, have dramatically improved the survival rates from cardiac arrest.
<br>
<br>"(8) Automated external defibrillator devices have been demonstrated to be safe and effective, even when used by lay people, since the devices are designed not to allow a user to administer a shock until after the device has analyzed a victim's heart rhythm and determined that an electric shock is required.
<br>
<br>"(9) Increasing public awareness regarding automated external defibrillator devices and encouraging their use in Federal buildings will greatly facilitate their adoption.
<br>
<br>"(10) Limiting the liability of Good Samaritans and acquirers of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations may encourage the use of automated external defibrillator devices, and result in saved lives."
<br>Certain Technologies and Practices Regarding Survival Rates for Cardiac Arrest
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–129, §7, Dec. 6, 1999, 113 Stat. 1676, provided that: "The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the General Services Administration and other appropriate public and private entities, develop recommendations regarding the placement of automatic external defibrillators in Federal buildings as a means of improving the survival rates of individuals who experience cardiac arrest in such buildings, including recommendations on training, maintenance, and medical oversight, and on coordinating with the system for emergency medical services."
<br>§238q. Liability regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators
<br>(a) Good Samaritan protections regarding AEDs
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b), any person who uses or attempts to use an automated external defibrillator device on a victim of a perceived medical emergency is immune from civil liability for any harm resulting from the use or attempted use of such device; and in addition, any person who acquired the device is immune from such liability, if the harm was not due to the failure of such acquirer of the device—
<br>
<br>(1) to notify local emergency response personnel or other appropriate entities of the most recent placement of the device within a reasonable period of time after the device was placed;
<br>
<br>(2) to properly maintain and test the device; or
<br>
<br>(3) to provide appropriate training in the use of the device to an employee or agent of the acquirer when the employee or agent was the person who used the device on the victim, except that such requirement of training does not apply if—
<br>
<br>(A) the employee or agent was not an employee or agent who would have been reasonably expected to use the device; or
<br>
<br>(B) the period of time elapsing between the engagement of the person as an employee or agent and the occurrence of the harm (or between the acquisition of the device and the occurrence of the harm, in any case in which the device was acquired after such engagement of the person) was not a reasonably sufficient period in which to provide the training.
<br>(b) Inapplicability of immunity
<br>
<br>Immunity under subsection (a) does not apply to a person if—
<br>
<br>(1) the harm involved was caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the victim who was harmed;
<br>
<br>(2) the person is a licensed or certified health professional who used the automated external defibrillator device while acting within the scope of the license or certification of the professional and within the scope of the employment or agency of the professional;
<br>
<br>(3) the person is a hospital, clinic, or other entity whose purpose is providing health care directly to patients, and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent; or
<br>
<br>(4) the person is an acquirer of the device who leased the device to a health care entity (or who otherwise provided the device to such entity for compensation without selling the device to the entity), and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent.
<br>(c) Rules of construction
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The following applies with respect to this section:
<br>
<br>(A) This section does not establish any cause of action, or require that an automated external defibrillator device be placed at any building or other location.
<br>
<br>(B) With respect to a class of persons for which this section provides immunity from civil liability, this section supersedes the law of a State only to the extent that the State has no statute or regulations that provide persons in such class with immunity for civil liability arising from the use by such persons of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations (within the meaning of the State law or regulation involved).
<br>
<br>(C) This section does not waive any protection from liability for Federal officers or employees under—
<br>
<br>(i) section 233 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) sections 1346(b), 2672, and 2679 of title 28 or under alternative benefits provided by the United States where the availability of such benefits precludes a remedy under section 1346(b) of title 28.
<br>(2) Civil actions under Federal law
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The applicability of subsections (a) and (b) includes applicability to any action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that arises under Federal law.
<br>(B) Federal areas adopting State law
<br>
<br>If a geographic area is under Federal jurisdiction and is located within a State but out of the jurisdiction of the State, and if, pursuant to Federal law, the law of the State applies in such area regarding matters for which there is no applicable Federal law, then an action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that in such area arises under the law of the State is subject to subsections (a) through (c) in lieu of any related State law that would apply in such area in the absence of this subparagraph.
<br>(d) Federal jurisdiction
<br>
<br>In any civil action arising under State law, the courts of the State involved have jurisdiction to apply the provisions of this section exclusive of the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall ensure that a State, local, or Department of Health and Human Services plan to vaccinate individuals that is approved by the Secretary establishes procedures to ensure, consistent with the Declaration and any applicable guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that—

<br>
<br>(2) there is voluntary screening provided to potential participants that can identify health conditions relevant to contraindications; and
<br>

<br>§239a. Determination of eligibility and benefits
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish procedures for determining, as applicable with respect to an individual—
<br>
<br>(1) whether the individual is an eligible individual;
<br>
<br>(2) whether an eligible individual has sustained a covered injury or injuries for which medical benefits or compensation may be available under sections 239c and 239d of this title, and the amount of such benefits or compensation; and
<br>
<br>(3) whether the covered injury or injuries of an eligible individual caused the individual's death for purposes of benefits under section 239e of this title.
<br>(b) Covered individuals
<br>
<br>The Secretary may accept a certification, by a Federal, State, or local government entity or private health care entity participating in the administration of covered countermeasures under the Declaration, that an individual is a covered individual.
<br>(c) Criteria for reimbursement
<br>(1) Injuries specified in injury table
<br>
<br>In any case where an injury or other adverse effect specified in the injury table established under section 239b of this title as a known effect of a vaccine manifests in an individual within the time period specified in such table, such injury or other effect shall be presumed to have resulted from administration of such vaccine.
<br>(2) Other determinations
<br>
<br>In making determinations other than those described in paragraph (1) as to the causation or severity of an injury, the Secretary shall employ a preponderance of the evidence standard and take into consideration all relevant medical and scientific evidence presented for consideration, and may obtain and consider the views of qualified medical experts.
<br>(d) Deadline for filing request
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not consider any request for a benefit under this part with respect to an individual, unless—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of a request based on the administration of the vaccine to the individual, the individual files with the Secretary an initial request for benefits or compensation under this part not later than one year after the date of administration of the vaccine; or
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a request based on accidental vaccinia inoculation, the individual files with the Secretary an initial request for benefits or compensation under this part not later than two years after the date of the first symptom or manifestation of onset of the adverse effect.
<br>(e) Structured settlements at Secretary's option
<br>
<br>In any case in which there is a reasonable likelihood that compensation or payment under section 239c, 239d, or 239e(b) of this title will be required for a period in excess of one year from the date an individual is determined eligible for such compensation or payment, the Secretary shall have the discretion to make a lump-sum payment, purchase an annuity or medical insurance policy, or execute an appropriate structured settlement agreement, provided that such payment, annuity, policy, or agreement is actuarially determined to have a value equal to the present value of the projected total amount of benefits or compensation that the individual is eligible to receive under such section or sections.
<br>(f) Review of determination
<br>(1) Secretary's review authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary may review a determination under this section at any time on the Secretary's own motion or on application, and may affirm, vacate, or modify such determination in any manner the Secretary deems appropriate. The Secretary shall develop a process by which an individual may file a request for reconsideration of any determination made by the Secretary under this section.
<br>(2) Judicial and administrative review
<br>
<br>No court of the United States, or of any State, District, territory or possession thereof, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary under this section. No officer or employee of the United States shall review any action by the Secretary under this section (unless the President specifically directs otherwise).

<br>(a) 1 Smallpox vaccine injury table
<br>(1) Establishment required
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish by interim final regulation a table identifying adverse effects (including injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths) that shall be presumed to result from the administration of (or exposure to) a smallpox vaccine, and the time period in which the first symptom or manifestation of onset of each such adverse effect must manifest in order for such presumption to apply.
<br>(2) Amendments
<br>
<br>The Secretary may by regulation amend the table established under paragraph (1). An amendment to the table takes effect on the date of the promulgation of the final rule that makes the amendment, and applies to all requests for benefits or compensation under this part that are filed on or after such date or are pending as of such date. In addition, the amendment applies retroactively to an individual who was not with respect to the injury involved an eligible individual under the table as in effect before the amendment but who with respect to such injury is an eligible individual under the table as amended. With respect to a request for benefits or compensation under this part by an individual who becomes an eligible individual as described in the preceding sentence, the Secretary may not provide such benefits or compensation unless the request (or amendment to a request, as applicable) is filed before the expiration of one year after the effective date of the amendment to the table in the case of an individual to whom the vaccine was administered and before the expiration of two years after such effective date in the case of a request based on accidental vaccinia inoculation.

<br>
<br>(July 1, 1944, ch. 373, title II, §264, as added Pub. L. 108–20, §2, Apr. 30, 2003, 117 Stat. 641.)

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall pay, in the case of an eligible individual whose death is determined to have resulted from a covered injury or injuries, a death benefit in the amount determined under paragraph (2) to the survivor or survivors in the same manner as death benefits are paid pursuant to the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program under subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796 et seq.) 1 with respect to an eligible deceased (except that in the case of an eligible individual who is a minor with no living parent, the legal guardian shall be considered the survivor in the place of the parent).
