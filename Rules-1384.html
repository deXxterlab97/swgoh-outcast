<br>(C) Any Tribal-State compact negotiated under subparagraph (A) may include provisions relating to—
<br>
<br>(i) the application of the criminal and civil laws and regulations of the Indian tribe or the State that are directly related to, and necessary for, the licensing and regulation of such activity;
<br>
<br>(ii) the allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction between the State and the Indian tribe necessary for the enforcement of such laws and regulations;
<br>
<br>(iii) the assessment by the State of such activities in such amounts as are necessary to defray the costs of regulating such activity;
<br>
<br>(iv) taxation by the Indian tribe of such activity in amounts comparable to amounts assessed by the State for comparable activities;
<br>
<br>(v) remedies for breach of contract;
<br>
<br>(vi) standards for the operation of such activity and maintenance of the gaming facility, including licensing; and
<br>
<br>(vii) any other subjects that are directly related to the operation of gaming activities.
<br>
<br>(4) Except for any assessments that may be agreed to under paragraph (3)(C)(iii) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an Indian tribe to engage in a class III activity. No State may refuse to enter into the negotiations described in paragraph (3)(A) based upon the lack of authority in such State, or its political subdivisions, to impose such a tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.
<br>
<br>(5) Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State, except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.
<br>
<br>(6) The provisions of section 1175 of title 15 shall not apply to any gaming conducted under a Tribal-State compact that—
<br>
<br>(A) is entered into under paragraph (3) by a State in which gambling devices are legal, and
<br>
<br>(B) is in effect.
<br>
<br>(7)(A) The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over—
<br>
<br>(i) any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such negotiations in good faith,
<br>
<br>(ii) any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin a class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and
<br>
<br>(iii) any cause of action initiated by the Secretary to enforce the procedures prescribed under subparagraph (B)(vii).
<br>
<br>(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations under paragraph (3)(A).
<br>
<br>(ii) In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that—
<br>
<br>(I) a Tribal-State compact has not been entered into under paragraph (3), and
<br>
<br>(II) the State did not respond to the request of the Indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith,
<br>
<br>the burden of proof shall be upon the State to prove that the State has negotiated with the Indian tribe in good faith to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities.
<br>
<br>(iii) If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe 2 to conclude such a compact within a 60-day period. In determining in such an action whether a State has negotiated in good faith, the court—
<br>
<br>(I) may take into account the public interest, public safety, criminality, financial integrity, and adverse economic impacts on existing gaming activities, and
<br>
<br>(II) shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.
<br>
<br>(iv) If a State and an Indian tribe fail to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities on the Indian lands subject to the jurisdiction of such Indian tribe within the 60-day period provided in the order of a court issued under clause (iii), the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact. The mediator shall select from the two proposed compacts the one which best comports with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable Federal law and with the findings and order of the court.
<br>
<br>(v) The mediator appointed by the court under clause (iv) shall submit to the State and the Indian tribe the compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv).
<br>
<br>(vi) If a State consents to a proposed compact during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the proposed compact is submitted by the mediator to the State under clause (v), the proposed compact shall be treated as a Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(vii) If the State does not consent during the 60-day period described in clause (vi) to a proposed compact submitted by a mediator under clause (v), the mediator shall notify the Secretary and the Secretary shall prescribe, in consultation with the Indian tribe, procedures—
<br>
<br>(I) which are consistent with the proposed compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv), the provisions of this chapter, and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State, and
<br>
<br>(II) under which class III gaming may be conducted on the Indian lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>(8)(A) The Secretary is authorized to approve any Tribal-State compact entered into between an Indian tribe and a State governing gaming on Indian lands of such Indian tribe.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may disapprove a compact described in subparagraph (A) only if such compact violates—
<br>
<br>(i) any provision of this chapter,
<br>
<br>(ii) any other provision of Federal law that does not relate to jurisdiction over gaming on Indian lands, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the trust obligations of the United States to Indians.
<br>
<br>(C) If the Secretary does not approve or disapprove a compact described in subparagraph (A) before the date that is 45 days after the date on which the compact is submitted to the Secretary for approval, the compact shall be considered to have been approved by the Secretary, but only to the extent the compact is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of any Tribal-State compact that is approved, or considered to have been approved, under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(9) An Indian tribe may enter into a management contract for the operation of a class III gaming activity if such contract has been submitted to, and approved by, the Chairman. The Chairman's review and approval of such contract shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (h) of section 2711 of this title.
<br>(e) Approval of ordinances
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, by not later than the date that is 90 days after the date on which any tribal gaming ordinance or resolution is submitted to the Chairman, the Chairman shall approve such ordinance or resolution if it meets the requirements of this section. Any such ordinance or resolution not acted upon at the end of that 90-day period shall be considered to have been approved by the Chairman, but only to the extent such ordinance or resolution is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

<br>
<br>(6) for grounds and mechanisms for terminating such contract, but actual contract termination shall not require the approval of the Commission.
<br>(c) Fee based on percentage of net revenues
<br>
<br>(1) The Chairman may approve a management contract providing for a fee based upon a percentage of the net revenues of a tribal gaming activity if the Chairman determines that such percentage fee is reasonable in light of surrounding circumstances.

<br>
<br>(2) Upon the request of an Indian tribe, the Chairman may approve a management contract providing for a fee based upon a percentage of the net revenues of a tribal gaming activity that exceeds 30 percent but not 40 percent of the net revenues if the Chairman is satisfied that the capital investment required, and income projections, for such tribal gaming activity require the additional fee requested by the Indian tribe.
<br>(d) Period for approval; extension
<br>
<br>By no later than the date that is 180 days after the date on which a management contract is submitted to the Chairman for approval, the Chairman shall approve or disapprove such contract on its merits. The Chairman may extend the 180-day period by not more than 90 days if the Chairman notifies the Indian tribe in writing of the reason for the extension. The Indian tribe may bring an action in a United States district court to compel action by the Chairman if a contract has not been approved or disapproved within the period required by this subsection.

<br>
<br>(2) the management contractor has, or has attempted to, unduly interfere or influence for its gain or advantage any decision or process of tribal government relating to the gaming activity;

<br>
<br>"(1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust obligations to provide for the public safety of Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress and the President have acknowledged that—
<br>
<br>"(A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the first responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and
<br>
<br>"(B) tribal justice systems are often the most appropriate institutions for maintaining law and order in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, which reflects less than ½ of the law enforcement presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;
<br>
<br>"(4) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in Indian country—
<br>
<br>"(A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to provide public safety to Indian communities;

<br>
<br>"(6) Indian tribes have faced significant increases in instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on Indian reservations; and
<br>
<br>"(7) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, but for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Justice have not been able to coordinate or consistently report crime and prosecution rates in tribal communities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2010 Amendment note above] are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes committed in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(2) to increase coordination and communication among Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;
<br>
<br>"(3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, resources, and information necessary to safely and effectively provide public safety in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in Indian country and to combat sexual and domestic violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women;
<br>
<br>"(5) to prevent drug trafficking and reduce rates of alcohol and drug addiction in Indian country; and
<br>
<br>"(6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal data and the sharing of criminal history information among Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for responding to and investigating crimes in Indian country."

<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>Section 5412(a) of this title, referred to in subsec. (g)(2), was in the original "section 701(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act", and was translated as reading "section 702(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act", meaning section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93–638, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 93–638 does not contain a section 701(a), and section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93–638 relates to establishment of the Indian Law Enforcement Foundation.
