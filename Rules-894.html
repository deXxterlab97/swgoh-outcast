<br>(5) Evasion
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term "evasion" refers to entering covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of any document or electronically transmitted data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that is material, and that results in any cash deposit or other security or any amount of applicable antidumping or countervailing duties being reduced or not being applied with respect to the merchandise.
<br>(B) Exception for clerical error
<br>(i) In general

<br>Except as provided in clause (ii), the term "evasion" does not include entering covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of—

<br>If the Commissioner determines that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of a clerical error referred to in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) and that the clerical error is part of a pattern of negligent conduct on the part of that person, the Commissioner may determine, notwithstanding clause (i), that the person has entered such covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.
<br>(iii) Electronic repetition of errors
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (ii), the mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.
<br>(iv) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>A determination by the Commissioner that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of a clerical error referred to in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) rather than through evasion shall not be construed to excuse that person from the payment of any duties applicable to the merchandise.

<br>(b) Investigations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 15 business days after receiving an allegation described in paragraph (2) or a referral described in paragraph (3), the Commissioner shall initiate an investigation if the Commissioner determines that the information provided in the allegation or the referral, as the case may be, reasonably suggests that covered merchandise has been entered into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

<br>
<br>(i) refer the matter to the administering authority to determine whether the merchandise is covered merchandise pursuant to the authority of the administering authority under subtitle IV; and
<br>
<br>(ii) notify the party that filed the allegation, and any other interested party participating in the investigation, of the referral.

<br>
<br>The period required for any referral and determination under this paragraph shall not be counted in calculating any deadline under this section.
<br>(D) Rule of construction
<br>

<br>(5) Consolidation of allegations and referrals
<br>(A) In general

<br>(6) Information-sharing to protect health and safety
<br>
<br>If, during the course of conducting an investigation under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner has reason to suspect that such covered merchandise may pose a health or safety risk to consumers, the Commissioner shall provide, as appropriate, information to the appropriate Federal agencies for purposes of mitigating the risk.
<br>(7) Technical assistance and advice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Upon request, the Commissioner shall provide technical assistance and advice to eligible small businesses to enable such businesses to prepare and submit allegations described in paragraph (2), except that the Commissioner may deny technical assistance if the Commissioner concludes that the allegation, if submitted, would not lead to the initiation of an investigation under this subsection or any other action to address the allegation.
<br>(B) Eligible small business defined
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>In this paragraph, the term "eligible small business" means any business concern that the Commissioner determines, due to its small size, has neither adequate internal resources nor the financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and filing allegations described in paragraph (2).
<br>(ii) Non-reviewability
<br>

<br>
<br>The Commissioner may extend the time to make a determination under subparagraph (A) by not more than 60 calendar days if the Commissioner determines that—

<br>(B) Application
<br>
<br>An inference described in subparagraph (A) may be used under that subparagraph with respect to a person described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) without regard to whether another person involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by the Commissioner, such as import or export documentation.
