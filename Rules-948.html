<br>
<br>(i) encourages compliance with the obligations of the agreement;
<br>
<br>(ii) is appropriate to the parties, nature, subject matter, and scope of the violation; and
<br>

<br>(iii) the availability of equivalent remedies.

<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to trade remedy laws are—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) to address and remedy market distortions that lead to dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, cartelization, and market access barriers.
<br>(18) Border taxes

<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to trade in textiles and apparel articles are to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports of textiles and apparel in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in textiles and apparel.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to an agreement that is proposed to be entered into with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership countries and to which section 4202(b) of this title will apply, the principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding commercial partnerships are the following:
<br>
<br>(i) To discourage actions by potential trading partners that directly or indirectly prejudice or otherwise discourage commercial activity solely between the United States and Israel.
<br>
<br>(ii) To discourage politically motivated actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel and to seek the elimination of politically motivated nontariff barriers on Israeli goods, services, or other commerce imposed on the State of Israel.

<br>(21) Good governance, transparency, the effective operation of legal regimes, and the rule of law of trading partners
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to ensuring implementation of trade commitments and obligations by strengthening good governance, transparency, the effective operation of legal regimes and the rule of law of trading partners of the United States is through capacity building and other appropriate means, which are important parts of the broader effort to create more open democratic societies and to promote respect for internationally recognized human rights.
<br>(22) Fisheries negotiations
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to trade in fish, seafood, and shellfish products are—
<br>
<br>(A) to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports of fish, seafood, and shellfish products in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports of fish, seafood, and shellfish products in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in fish, seafood, and shellfish products, including by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers;
<br>
<br>(B) to eliminate fisheries subsidies that distort trade, including subsidies of the type referred to in paragraph 9 of Annex D to the Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization at the Sixth Ministerial Conference at Hong Kong, China on December 18, 2005;
<br>
<br>(C) to pursue transparency in fisheries subsidies programs; and
<br>
<br>(D) to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.
<br>(c) Capacity building and other priorities
<br>
<br>In order to address and maintain United States competitiveness in the global economy, the President shall—
<br>
<br>(1) direct the heads of relevant Federal agencies—
<br>
<br>(A) to work to strengthen the capacity of United States trading partners to carry out obligations under trade agreements by consulting with any country seeking a trade agreement with the United States concerning that country's laws relating to customs and trade facilitation, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment; and
<br>
<br>(B) to provide technical assistance to that country if needed;
<br>

<br>§4202. Trade agreements authority
<br>(a) Agreements regarding tariff barriers
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries before—
<br>
<br>(i) July 1, 2018; or
<br>
<br>(ii) July 1, 2021, if trade authorities procedures are extended under subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), proclaim—
<br>
<br>(i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
<br>
<br>(ii) such continuance of existing duty free or excise treatment, or
<br>
<br>(iii) such additional duties,
<br>
<br>as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
<br>
<br>Substantial modifications to, or substantial additional provisions of, a trade agreement entered into after July 1, 2018, or July 1, 2021, if trade authorities procedures are extended under subsection (c), shall not be eligible for approval under this chapter.
<br>(2) Notification
<br>
<br>The President shall notify Congress of the President's intention to enter into an agreement under this subsection.
<br>(3) Limitations
<br>
<br>No proclamation may be made under paragraph (1) that—
<br>
<br>(A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on June 29, 2015) to a rate of duty which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on June 29, 2015;
<br>
<br>(B) reduces the rate of duty below that applicable under the Uruguay Round Agreements or a successor agreement, on any import sensitive agricultural product; or
<br>
<br>(C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applied on June 29, 2015.
<br>(4) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging
<br>(A) Aggregate reduction
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of 1/10 of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed under paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a reduction equal to the amount applicable under clause (i) had taken effect at 1-year intervals after the effective date of such first reduction.
<br>(B) Exemption from staging
<br>
<br>No staging is required under subparagraph (A) with respect to a duty reduction that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that is not produced in the United States. The United States International Trade Commission shall advise the President of the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.
<br>(5) Rounding
<br>
<br>If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (4), the President may round an annual reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
<br>
<br>(B) ½ of 1 percent ad valorem.
<br>(6) Other limitations
<br>
<br>A rate of duty reduction that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (3) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction is included within an implementing bill provided for under section 4205 of this title and that bill is enacted into law.
<br>(7) Other tariff modifications
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraphs (1)(B), (3)(A), (3)(C), and (4) through (6), and subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3524), the President may proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX, as defined in section 2(5) of that Act (19 U.S.C. 3501(5)), if the United States agrees to such modification or staged rate reduction in a negotiation for the reciprocal elimination or harmonization of duties under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.
<br>(8) Authority under Uruguay Round Agreements Act not affected
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority provided to the President under section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).
<br>(b) Agreements regarding tariff and nontariff barriers
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>(A) Whenever the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) 1 or more existing duties or any other import restriction of any foreign country or the United States or any other barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect,
<br>
<br>and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President may enter into a trade agreement described in subparagraph (B) during the period described in subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(B) The President may enter into a trade agreement under subparagraph (A) with foreign countries providing for—
<br>
<br>(i) the reduction or elimination of a duty, restriction, barrier, or other distortion described in subparagraph (A); or

<br>
<br>Substantial modifications to, or substantial additional provisions of, a trade agreement entered into after July 1, 2018, or July 1, 2021, if trade authorities procedures are extended under subsection (c), shall not be eligible for approval under this chapter.
<br>(2) Conditions
<br>
<br>A trade agreement may be entered into under this subsection only if such agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 4201 of this title and the President satisfies the conditions set forth in sections 4203 and 4204 of this title.
<br>(3) Bills qualifying for trade authorities procedures
<br>
<br>(A) The provisions of section 2191 of this title (in this chapter referred to as "trade authorities procedures") apply to a bill of either House of Congress which contains provisions described in subparagraph (B) to the same extent as such section 2191 applies to implementing bills under that section. A bill to which this paragraph applies shall hereafter in this chapter be referred to as an "implementing bill".
<br>
<br>(B) The provisions referred to in subparagraph (A) are—
<br>
<br>(i) a provision approving a trade agreement entered into under this subsection and approving the statement of administrative action, if any, proposed to implement such trade agreement; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if changes in existing laws or new statutory authority are required to implement such trade agreement or agreements, only such provisions as are strictly necessary or appropriate to implement such trade agreement or agreements, either repealing or amending existing laws or providing new statutory authority.

<br>
<br>(B) the trade authorities procedures shall be extended to implementing bills submitted with respect to trade agreements entered into under subsection (b) after June 30, 2018, and before July 1, 2021, if (and only if)—

<br>
<br>(ii) neither House of Congress adopts an extension disapproval resolution under paragraph (5) before July 1, 2018.

<br>
<br>The President shall promptly inform the United States International Trade Commission of the decision of the President to submit a report to Congress under paragraph (2). The International Trade Commission shall submit to Congress as soon as practicable, but not later than June 1, 2018, a written report that contains a review and analysis of the economic impact on the United States of all trade agreements implemented between June 29, 2015, and the date on which the President decides to seek an extension requested under paragraph (2).
<br>(4) Status of reports
<br>
<br>The reports submitted to Congress under paragraphs (2) and (3), or any portion of such reports, may be classified to the extent the President determines appropriate.
<br>(5) Extension disapproval resolutions
<br>
<br>(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "extension disapproval resolution" means a resolution of either House of Congress, the sole matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: "That the ________ disapproves the request of the President for the extension, under section 103(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, of the trade authorities procedures under that Act to any implementing bill submitted with respect to any trade agreement entered into under section 103(b) of that Act after June 30, 2018.", with the blank space being filled with the name of the resolving House of Congress.
