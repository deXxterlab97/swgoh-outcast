<br>§8131. Subrogation of the United States
<br>
<br>(a) If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability on a person other than the United States to pay damages, the Secretary of Labor may require the beneficiary to—
<br>
<br>(1) assign to the United States any right of action he may have to enforce the liability or any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of that liability; or
<br>
<br>(2) prosecute the action in his own name.
<br>
<br>An employee required to appear as a party or witness in the prosecution of such an action is in an active duty status while so engaged.
<br>
<br>(b) A beneficiary who refuses to assign or prosecute an action in his own name when required by the Secretary is not entitled to compensation under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may prosecute or compromise a cause of action assigned to the United States. When the Secretary realizes on the cause of action, he shall deduct therefrom and place to the credit of the Employees' Compensation Fund the amount of compensation already paid to the beneficiary and the expense of realization or collection. Any surplus shall be paid to the beneficiary and credited on future payments of compensation payable for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to not less than one-fifth of the net amount of a settlement or recovery remaining after the expenses thereof have been deducted.
<br>
<br>(d) If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in the Panama Canal Company to pay damages under the law of a State, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country, compensation is not payable until the individual entitled to compensation—
<br>
<br>(1) releases to the Panama Canal Company any right of action he may have to enforce the liability of the Panama Canal Company; or
<br>
<br>(2) assigns to the United States any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of the liability of the Panama Canal Company.

<br>§8132. Adjustment after recovery from a third person
<br>
<br>If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages, and a beneficiary entitled to compensation from the United States for that injury or death receives money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement by him or in his behalf, the beneficiary, after deducting therefrom the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney's fee, shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States and credit any surplus on future payments of compensation payable to him for the same injury. No court, insurer, attorney, or other person shall pay or distribute to the beneficiary or his designee the proceeds of such suit or settlement without first satisfying or assuring satisfaction of the interest of the United States. The amount refunded to the United States shall be credited to the Employees' Compensation Fund. If compensation has not been paid to the beneficiary, he shall credit the money or property on compensation payable to him by the United States for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to retain, as a minimum, at least one-fifth of the net amount of the money or other property remaining after the expenses of a suit or settlement have been deducted; and in addition to this minimum and at the time of distribution, an amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney's fee proportionate to the refund to the United States.

<br>§8133. Compensation in case of death
<br>
<br>(a) If death results from an injury sustained in the performance of duty, the United States shall pay a monthly compensation equal to a percentage of the monthly pay of the deceased employee in accordance with the following schedule:
<br>
<br>(1) To the widow or widower, if there is no child, 50 percent.
<br>
<br>(2) To the widow or widower, if there is a child, 45 percent and in addition 15 percent for each child not to exceed a total of 75 percent for the widow or widower and children.
<br>
<br>(3) To the children, if there is no widow or widower, 40 percent for one child and 15 percent additional for each additional child not to exceed a total of 75 percent, divided among the children share and share alike.
<br>
<br>(4) To the parents, if there is no widow, widower, or child, as follows—
<br>
<br>(A) 25 percent if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;
<br>
<br>(B) 20 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; or
<br>
<br>(C) a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor if one or both were partly dependent.
<br>
<br>If there is a widow, widower, or child, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.
<br>
<br>(5) To the brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren, if there is no widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, as follows—
<br>
<br>(A) 20 percent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death;
<br>
<br>(B) 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike; or
<br>
<br>(C) 10 percent if no one is wholly dependent but one or more is partly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike.
<br>
<br>If there is a widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, children, and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.
<br>
<br>(b) The compensation payable under subsection (a) of this section is paid from the time of death until—
<br>
<br>(1) a widow, or widower dies or remarries before reaching age 55;
<br>
<br>(2) a child, a brother, a sister, or a grandchild dies, marries, or becomes 18 years of age, or if over age 18 and incapable of self-support becomes capable of self-support; or
<br>
<br>(3) a parent or grandparent dies, marries, or ceases to be dependent.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by section 8101 of this title at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries. A widow or widower who has entitlements to benefits under this title derived from more than one husband or wife shall elect one entitlement to be utilized.
<br>
<br>(c) On the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of an individual, the compensation of the remaining individuals entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable, is that which they would have received if they had been the only individuals entitled to compensation at the time of the death of the employee.
<br>
<br>(d) When there are two or more classes of individuals entitled to compensation under this section and the apportionment of compensation under this section would result in injustice, the Secretary may modify the apportionment to meet the requirements of the case.
<br>
<br>(e) In computing compensation under this section, the monthly pay is deemed not less than the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–2. However, the total monthly compensation may not exceed—
<br>
<br>(1) the monthly pay computed under section 8114 of this title, except for increases authorized by section 8146a of this title; or
<br>
<br>(2) 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS–15.
<br>
<br>(f) Notwithstanding any funeral and burial expenses paid under section 8134, there shall be paid a sum of $200 to the personal representative of a deceased employee within the meaning of section 8101(1) of this title for reimbursement of the costs of termination of the decedent's status as an employee of the United States.

<br>Administration of this subchapter was transferred to the Secretary of Labor by section 1 of 1950 Reorg. Plan. No. 19, 64 Stat. 1271 (see section 8145).
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
<br>§8137. Compensation for noncitizens and nonresidents
<br>
<br>(a) When the Secretary of Labor finds that the amount of compensation payable to an employee who is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States or Canada, or payable to a dependent of such an employee, is substantially disproportionate to compensation for disability or death payable in similar cases under local statute, regulation, custom, or otherwise at the place outside the continental United States or Canada where the employee is working at the time of injury, he may provide for payment of compensation on a basis reasonably in accord with prevailing local payments in similar cases by—
<br>
<br>(1) the adoption or adaption of the substantive features, by a schedule or otherwise, of local workmen's compensation provisions or other local statute, regulation, or custom applicable in cases of personal injury or death; or
<br>
<br>(2) establishing special schedules of compensation for injury, death, and loss of use of members and functions of the body for specific classes of employees, areas, and places.
<br>
<br>Irrespective of the basis adopted, the Secretary may at any time—
<br>
<br>(A) modify or limit the maximum monthly and total aggregate payments for injury, death, and medical or other benefits;
<br>
<br>(B) modify or limit the percentages of the wage of the employee payable as compensation for the injury or death; and
<br>
<br>(C) modify, limit, or redesignate the class or classes of beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, including the designation of persons, representatives, or groups entitled to payment under local statute or custom whether or not included in the classes of beneficiaries otherwise specified by this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(b) In a case under this section, the Secretary or his designee may—
<br>
<br>(1) make a lump-sum award in the manner prescribed by section 8135 of this title when he or his designee considers it to be for the best interest of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) compromise and pay a claim for benefits, including a claim in which there is a dispute as to jurisdiction or other fact or a question of law.
<br>
<br>Compensation paid under this subsection is instead of all other compensation from the United States for the same injury or death, and a payment made under this subsection is deemed compensation under this subchapter and is satisfaction of all liability of the United States in respect to the particular injury or death.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may delegate to an employee or agency of the United States, with such limitations and right of review as he considers advisable, authority to process, adjudicate, commute by lump-sum award, compromise, and pay a claim or class of claims for compensation, and to provide other benefits, locally, under this section, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary. For this purpose, the Secretary may provide or transfer funds, including reimbursement of amounts paid under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary may waive the application of this subchapter in whole or in part and for such period or periods as he may fix if he finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) conditions prevent the establishment of facilities for processing and adjudicating claims under this section; or
<br>
<br>(2) claimants under this section are alien enemies.
<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary may apply this section retrospectively with adjustment of compensation and benefits as he considers necessary and proper.

In administering this subchapter for an enrollee covered by this subsection—
<br>
<br>(1) the monthly pay of an enrollee is deemed that received at the minimum rate for GS–2;
<br>
<br>(2) section 8113(a) of this title applies to an enrollee; and

<br>(3) "performance of duty" does not include an act of an enrollee while absent from his assigned post of duty, except while participating in an activity (including an activity while on pass or during travel to or from the post of duty) authorized by or under the direction and supervision of the Job Corps.
<br>
<br>(b) This subchapter applies to a volunteer in service to America who receives either a living allowance or a stipend under part A of subchapter VIII of chapter 34 of title 42, with respect to that service and training, to the same extent as enrollees of the Job Corps under subsection (a) of this section. However, for the purpose of the computation described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, the monthly pay of a volunteer is deemed that received at the minimum rate for GS–5 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5, United States Code.

<br>(b) When administration is transferred under subsection (a) of this section, the expenses incident to physical examinations which are payable under section 8123 of this title shall be paid from appropriations for the Panama Canal Commission or for The Alaska Railroad, as the case may be, instead of from the Employees' Compensation Fund. The President may authorize the Panama Canal Commission and the general manager of The Alaska Railroad to pay the compensation provided by this subchapter, including medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies under section 8103 of this title and the transportation and burial expenses under sections 8103 and 8134 of this title, from appropriations for the Panama Canal Commission and for The Alaska Railroad, and these appropriations shall be reimbursed for the payments by transfer of funds from the Employees' Compensation Fund.

<br>(d) When administration is transferred under subsection (a) of this section to the general manager of The Alaska Railroad, the Secretary of Labor is not divested of jurisdiction and a claimant is entitled to appeal from the decision of the general manager of The Alaska Railroad to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary on receipt of an appeal shall, or on his own motion may, review the decision of the general manager of The Alaska Railroad, and in accordance with the facts found on review may proceed under section 8128 of this title. The Secretary shall provide the form and manner of taking an appeal.

<br>
<br>(b) Before August 15 of each year, the Secretary shall furnish to each agency and instrumentality of the United States having an employee who is or may be entitled to compensation benefits under this subchapter or any extension or application thereof a statement showing the total cost of benefits and other payments made from the Employees' Compensation Fund during the preceding July 1 through June 30 expense period on account of the injury or death of employees or individuals under the jurisdiction of the agency or instrumentality. Each agency and instrumentality shall include in its annual budget estimates for the fiscal year beginning in the next calendar year a request for an appropriation in an amount equal to the costs. Sums appropriated pursuant to the request shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund within 30 days after they are available. An agency or instrumentality not dependent on an annual appropriation shall make the deposit required by this subsection from funds under its control during the first fifteen days of October following the furnishing of the statement. If an agency or instrumentality (or part or function thereof) is transferred to another agency or instrumentality, the cost of compensation benefits and other expenses paid from the Fund on account of the injury or death of employees of the transferred agency or instrumentality (or part or function) shall be included in costs of the receiving agency or instrumentality.
