<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12391. Partial Suspension of Federal Service Labor-Management Relations
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12391, Nov. 4, 1982, 47 F.R. 50457, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including Section 7103(b)(2) of Title 5 and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and having determined that it is necessary in the interest of national security to suspend certain labor-management relations provisions with respect to overseas activities of the Department of Defense, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Suspensions. With regard to United States citizen employees of the Department of Defense, including the Military Departments, who are employed outside the United States as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(18), with the exception of those employed in the Republic of Panama:
<br>
<br>(a) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7105(a)(2)(D), (E), (G), and (H) and of 5 U.S.C. 7123(b) are suspended with respect to any matter which substantially impairs the implementation by the United States Forces of any treaty or agreement, including any minutes or understandings thereto, between the United States and the Government of the host nation;
<br>
<br>(b) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7102(2), 7114(a)(1), 7114(a)(4), 7116(a)(5), and 7117(c) are suspended with respect to any matter proposed for bargaining which would substantially impair the implementation by the United States Forces of any treaty or agreement, including any minutes or understandings thereto, between the United States and the Government of the host nation;
<br>
<br>(c) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7116(a)(7) and 7117(b) are suspended with regard to any regulation governing the implementation by the United States Forces of any treaty or agreement, including any minutes or understandings thereto, between the United States and the Government of the host nations; and
<br>
<br>(d) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7121(b)(3)(C) are suspended with respect to any grievance involving the implementation by the United States Forces of any treaty or agreement, including any minutes or understandings thereto, between the United States and the Government of the host nation.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12632. Exclusions From Federal Labor-Management Relations Program
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12632, Mar. 23, 1988, 53 F.R. 9852, provided:
<br>
<br>By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 7103(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code, and in order to exempt certain agencies or subdivisions thereof from coverage of the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Determinations. The agencies or subdivisions thereof set forth in Section 3 of this Order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work. It is also hereby determined that Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code cannot be applied to these agencies or subdivisions in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations. These agencies or subdivisions thereof are hereby excluded from coverage under Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Relationship to Executive Order No. 12559. The determinations set forth in Section 1 of this Order are the same determinations that I made at the time of and as a predicate to my issuance on May 20, 1986, of Executive Order No. 12559 [amending Ex. Ord. No. 12171, set out as a note above], which was issued for the same purpose as this Order. On July 10, 1987, Executive Order No. 12559 was held by a United States District Court to be incomplete as a matter of form, and therefore invalid, because it did not expressly set forth these determinations. AFGE v. Reagan, Civil No. 86–1587 (D.D.C.). These determinations were not expressly set forth in the text of Executive Order No. 12559 because all that Order did was amend Executive Order No. 12171 [set out as a note above] by adding the agencies or subdivisions referred to in Section 1 of this Order to the list in Executive Order No. 12171 of entities excluded from coverage of the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program, and these determinations were already expressly set forth in the text of Executive Order No. 12171, which remains in effect (as amended). This Order is not intended to reflect any belief that the form of Executive Order No. 12559 was invalid, but is intended solely to accomplish the purpose of that Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Amendment of Executive Order No. 12171. Executive Order No. 12171 is amended by deleting Section 1–209 and inserting in its place:
<br>
<br>Sec. 1–209. Agencies or subdivisions of the Department of Justice. (a) The Office of Enforcement and the Office of Intelligence, including all domestic field offices and intelligence units, of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
<br>
<br>(b) The Office of Special Operations, the Threat Analysis Group, the Enforcement Operations Division, the Witness Security Division and the Court Security Division in the Office of the Director and the Enforcement Division in Offices of the United States Marshals in the United States Marshals Service.

<br>
<br>Section 1. Determinations. The subdivisions of the Department of Justice set forth in section 2 of this order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work. It is further determined that chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, cannot be applied to these subdivisions in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Amendment of Executive Order 12171. Executive Order 12171 of November 19, 1979, as amended, [set out above] is further amended by adding to the end of section 1–209 the following new subsections:

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13760, Jan. 12, 2017, 82 F.R. 5325, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7103(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and in order to reflect the effects of the reorganization and restructuring of the Department of Defense on its agencies and subdivisions exempted from coverage under the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Determinations. The agencies and subdivisions of the Department of Defense set forth in section 2 of this order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work. It is further determined that chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, cannot be applied to these subdivisions in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.

<br>Delegation of Certain Authority Under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 29, 2020, 85 F.R. 10033, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The national security interests of the United States require expedient and efficient decisionmaking. When new missions emerge or existing ones evolve, the Department of Defense requires maximum flexibility to respond to threats to carry out its mission of protecting the American people. This flexibility requires that military and civilian leadership manage their organizations to cultivate a lethal, agile force adaptive to new technologies and posture changes. Where collective bargaining is incompatible with these organizations' missions, the Department of Defense should not be forced to sacrifice its national security mission and, instead, seek relief through third parties and administrative fora.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority to the Secretary of Defense. (a) The Secretary of Defense (Secretary) is delegated authority under 5 U.S.C. 7103(b)(1) and 7103(b)(2) to issue orders excluding Department of Defense agencies or subdivisions thereof from Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute coverage. The Secretary is authorized to further delegate this authority to any official of the Department of Defense appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(b) When making the determination required by 5 U.S.C. 7103(b)(1) or 7103(b)(2), the Secretary or other official delegated this authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall publish this determination in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>(c) Any official to whom the Secretary of Defense delegates the authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may not further delegate this authority.
<br>
<br>(d) For purposes of this memorandum, the term "Department of Defense agencies or subdivisions" includes without limitation the military departments.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<br>
<br>(2) the last day of the Congress beginning after the date on which the member's term of office would (but for this paragraph) expire.
<br>
<br>(d) A vacancy in the Authority shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the Authority.
<br>
<br>(e) The Authority shall make an annual report to the President for transmittal to the Congress which shall include information as to the cases it has heard and the decisions it has rendered.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) The General Counsel of the Authority shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of 5 years. The General Counsel may be removed at any time by the President. The General Counsel shall hold no other office or position in the Government of the United States except as provided by law.
<br>
<br>(2) The General Counsel may—
<br>
<br>(A) investigate alleged unfair labor practices under this chapter,
<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF AGENCIES AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS
<br>§7111. Exclusive recognition of labor organizations
<br>
<br>(a) An agency shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the organization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit who cast valid ballots in the election.
<br>
<br>(b) If a petition is filed with the Authority—
<br>
<br>(1) by any person alleging—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is no exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is an exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit allege that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit; or
<br>
<br>(2) by any person seeking clarification of, or an amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation;
<br>
<br>the Authority shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after reasonable notice. If the Authority finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Authority shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any appropriate unit or in any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding 12 calendar months, a valid election under this subsection has been held.
<br>
<br>(c) A labor organization which—
<br>
<br>(1) has been designated by at least 10 percent of the employees in the unit specified in any petition filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section;
<br>
<br>(2) has submitted a valid copy of a current or recently expired collective bargaining agreement for the unit; or
<br>
<br>(3) has submitted other evidence that it is the exclusive representative of the employees involved;
<br>
<br>may intervene with respect to a petition filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and shall be placed on the ballot of any election under such subsection (b) with respect to the petition.
<br>
<br>(d) The Authority shall determine who is eligible to vote in any election under this section and shall establish rules governing any such election, which shall include rules allowing employees eligible to vote the opportunity to choose—
<br>
<br>(1) from labor organizations on the ballot, that labor organization which the employees wish to have represent them; or
<br>
<br>(2) not to be represented by a labor organization.
<br>
<br>In any election in which no choice on the ballot receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the highest number of votes. A labor organization which receives the majority of the votes cast in an election shall be certified by the Authority as the exclusive representative.
<br>
<br>(e) A labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the Authority and the agency involved a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.
<br>
<br>(f) Exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization—
<br>
<br>(1) if the Authority determines that the labor organization is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles;
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a petition filed pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, if there is not credible evidence that at least 30 percent of the employees in the unit specified in the petition wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by the labor organization seeking exclusive recognition;
<br>
<br>(3) if there is then in effect a lawful written collective bargaining agreement between the agency involved and an exclusive representative (other than the labor organization seeking exclusive recognition) covering any employees included in the unit specified in the petition, unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the collective bargaining agreement has been in effect for more than 3 years, or
<br>
<br>(B) the petition for exclusive recognition is filed not more than 105 days and not less than 60 days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement; or
<br>
<br>(4) if the Authority has, within the previous 12 calendar months, conducted a secret ballot election for the unit described in any petition under this section and in such election a majority of the employees voting chose a labor organization for certification as the unit's exclusive representative.
<br>
<br>(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election in conformity with regulations and rules or decisions of the Authority.

<br>§7112. Determination of appropriate units for labor organization representation
<br>
<br>(a) The Authority shall determine the appropriateness of any unit. The Authority shall determine in each case whether, in order to ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this chapter, the appropriate unit should be established on an agency, plant, installation, functional, or other basis and shall determine any unit to be an appropriate unit only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved.
<br>
<br>(b) A unit shall not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor shall a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes—
<br>
<br>(1) except as provided under section 7135(a)(2) of this title, any management official or supervisor;
<br>
<br>(2) a confidential employee;
<br>
<br>(3) an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity;
<br>
<br>(4) an employee engaged in administering the provisions of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(5) both professional employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit;
<br>
<br>(6) any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security; or
<br>
<br>(7) any employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by an agency whose duties directly affect the internal security of the agency, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.
<br>
<br>(c) Any employee who is engaged in administering any provision of law relating to labor-management relations may not be represented by a labor organization—
<br>
<br>(1) which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies; or
<br>
<br>(2) which is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies.
<br>
<br>(d) Two or more units which are in an agency and for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the agency or labor organization, be consolidated with or without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate. The Authority shall certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative of the new larger unit.

<br>
<br>(a) If, in connection with any agency, no labor organization has been accorded exclusive recognition on an agency basis, a labor organization which is the exclusive representative of a substantial number of the employees of the agency, as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Authority, shall be granted national consultation rights by the agency. National consultation rights shall terminate when the labor organization no longer meets the criteria prescribed by the Authority. Any issue relating to any labor organization's eligibility for, or continuation of, national consultation rights shall be subject to determination by the Authority.
<br>

<br>(A) be informed of any substantive change in conditions of employment proposed by the agency, and

<br>(B) be permitted reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding the changes.

<br>§7114. Representation rights and duties
<br>
<br>(a)(1) A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit. An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.
<br>
<br>(2) An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at—
<br>
<br>(A) any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment; or
<br>
<br>(B) any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if—

<br>
<br>(ii) the employee requests representation.
<br>
<br>(3) Each agency shall annually inform its employees of their rights under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) Any agency and any exclusive representative in any appropriate unit in the agency, through appropriate representatives, shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, the agency and the exclusive representative may determine appropriate techniques, consistent with the provisions of section 7119 of this title, to assist in any negotiation.
<br>
<br>(5) The rights of an exclusive representative under the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to preclude an employee from—
<br>
<br>(A) being represented by an attorney or other representative, other than the exclusive representative, of the employee's own choosing in any grievance or appeal action; or
<br>
<br>(B) exercising grievance or appellate rights established by law, rule, or regulation;
<br>
<br>except in the case of grievance or appeal procedures negotiated under this chapter.
<br>
