<br>
<br>The Secretary shall enter into a contract with an organization with expertise in housing and other demographic data collection methodologies under which the organization, in consultation with Indian tribes and Indian organizations, shall—
<br>

<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section, to remain available until expended.
<br>(b) Factors for determination of need
<br>
<br>The formula shall be based on factors that reflect the need of the Indian tribes and the Indian areas of the tribes for assistance for affordable housing activities, including the following factors:
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The number of low-income housing dwelling units developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.), pursuant to a contract between an Indian housing authority for the tribe and the Secretary, that are owned or operated by a recipient on the October 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year for which funds are provided, subject to the condition that such a unit shall not be considered to be a low-income housing dwelling unit for purposes of this section if—
<br>
<br>(i) the recipient ceases to possess the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the unit is lost to the recipient by conveyance, demolition, or other means.
<br>
<br>(B) If the unit is a homeownership unit not conveyed within 25 years from the date of full availability, the recipient shall not be considered to have lost the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit if the unit has not been conveyed to the homebuyer for reasons beyond the control of the recipient.
<br>
<br>(C) If the unit is demolished and the recipient rebuilds the unit within 1 year of demolition of the unit, the unit may continue to be considered a low-income housing dwelling unit for the purpose of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(D) In this paragraph, the term "reasons beyond the control of the recipient" means, after making reasonable efforts, there remain—
<br>
<br>(i) delays in obtaining or the absence of title status reports;
<br>
<br>(ii) incorrect or inadequate legal descriptions or other legal documentation necessary for conveyance;
<br>
<br>(iii) clouds on title due to probate or intestacy or other court proceedings; or
<br>
<br>(iv) any other legal impediment.
<br>
<br>(E) Subparagraphs (A) through (D) shall not apply to any claim arising from a formula current assisted stock calculation or count involving an Indian housing block grant allocation for any fiscal year through fiscal year 2008, if a civil action relating to the claim is filed by not later than 45 days after October 14, 2008.
<br>
<br>(2) The extent of poverty and economic distress and the number of Indian families within Indian areas of the tribe.
<br>
<br>(3) Other objectively measurable conditions as the Secretary and the Indian tribes may specify.
<br>(c) Other factors for consideration
<br>
<br>In establishing the formula, the Secretary shall consider—
<br>
<br>(1) the relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity; and
<br>
<br>(2) the extent to which terminations of assistance under subchapter V will affect funding available to State recognized tribes.
<br>(d) Funding for public housing operation and modernization
<br>(1) Full funding
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except with respect to an Indian tribe described in subparagraph (B), the formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is equal to or greater than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the total amount of such operating and modernization assistance provided for fiscal year 1996 for such tribe.
<br>(B) Certain Indian tribes
<br>
<br>With respect to fiscal year 2001 and each fiscal year thereafter, for any Indian tribe with an Indian housing authority that owns or operates fewer than 250 public housing units, the formula shall provide that if the amount provided for a fiscal year in which the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is equal to or greater than the amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of the public housing referred to in subparagraph (A), then the amount provided to that Indian tribe as modernization assistance shall be equal to the average annual amount of funds provided to the Indian tribe (other than funds provided as emergency assistance) under the assistance program under section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437l) for the period beginning with fiscal year 1992 and ending with fiscal year 1997.
<br>(2) Partial funding
<br>
<br>The formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is less than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount available for assistance under this chapter for such fiscal year that the amount of operating and modernization assistance provided for the tribe for fiscal year 1996 bears to the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of such public housing.
<br>(e) Effective date
<br>
<br>This section shall take effect on October 26, 1996.

<br>§4161. Remedies for noncompliance
<br>(a) Actions by Secretary affecting grant amounts
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b), if the Secretary finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a recipient of assistance under this chapter has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) terminate payments under this chapter to the recipient;
<br>
<br>(B) reduce payments under this chapter to the recipient by an amount equal to the amount of such payments that were not expended in accordance with this chapter;
<br>
<br>(C) limit the availability of payments under this chapter to programs, projects, or activities not affected by such failure to comply; or
<br>
<br>(D) in the case of noncompliance described in section 4162(b) of this title, provide a replacement tribally designated housing entity for the recipient, under section 4162 of this title.
<br>(2) Substantial noncompliance
<br>
<br>The failure of a recipient to comply with the requirements of section 4152(b)(1) of this title regarding the reporting of low-income dwelling units shall not, in itself, be considered to be substantial noncompliance for purposes of this subchapter.
<br>(3) Continuance of actions
<br>
<br>If the Secretary takes an action under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall continue such action until the Secretary determines that the failure to comply has ceased.
<br>(4) Exception for certain actions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the Secretary makes a determination that the failure of a recipient of assistance under this chapter to comply substantially with any material provision (as that term is defined by the Secretary) of this chapter is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of Federal funds in a manner that is not authorized by law, the Secretary may take an action described in paragraph (1)(C) before conducting a hearing.
<br>(B) Procedural requirement
<br>
<br>If the Secretary takes an action described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) provide notice to the recipient at the time that the Secretary takes that action; and
<br>
<br>(ii) conduct a hearing not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary provides notice under clause (i).
<br>(C) Determination
<br>
<br>Upon completion of a hearing under this paragraph, the Secretary shall make a determination regarding whether to continue taking the action that is the subject of the hearing, or take another action under this subsection.
<br>(b) Noncompliance because of technical incapacity
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Secretary makes a finding under subsection (a), but determines that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this chapter—
<br>
<br>(A) is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and
<br>
<br>(B) is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability and capacity of the recipient to administer assistance provided under this chapter in compliance with the requirements under this chapter, if the recipient enters into a performance agreement with the Secretary that specifies the compliance objectives that the recipient will be required to achieve by the termination date of the performance agreement.
<br>(2) Performance agreement
<br>
<br>The period of a performance agreement described in paragraph (1) shall be for 1 year.
<br>(3) Review
<br>
<br>Upon the termination of a performance agreement entered into under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall review the performance of the recipient that is a party to the agreement.
<br>(4) Effect of review
<br>
<br>If, on the basis of a review under paragraph (3), the Secretary determines that the recipient—
<br>
<br>(A) has made a good faith effort to meet the compliance objectives specified in the agreement, the Secretary may enter into an additional performance agreement for the period specified in paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(B) has failed to make a good faith effort to meet applicable compliance objectives, the Secretary shall determine the recipient to have failed to comply substantially with this chapter, and the recipient shall be subject to an action under subsection (a).
<br>(c) Referral for civil action
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>In lieu of, or in addition to, any action authorized by subsection (a), if the Secretary has reason to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted.
<br>(2) Civil action
<br>
<br>Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this chapter that was not expended in accordance with it, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.
<br>(d) Review
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any recipient who receives notice under subsection (a) of the termination, reduction, or limitation of payments under this chapter—
<br>
<br>(A) may, not later than 60 days after receiving such notice, file with the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such State is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a petition for review of the action of the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(B) upon the filing of any petition under subparagraph (A), shall forthwith transmit copies of the petition to the Secretary and the Attorney General of the United States, who shall represent the Secretary in the litigation.
<br>(2) Procedure
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall file in the court a record of the proceeding on which the Secretary based the action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. No objection to the action of the Secretary shall be considered by the court unless such objection has been urged before the Secretary.
<br>(3) Disposition
<br>(A) Court proceedings
<br>
<br>The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm or modify the action of the Secretary or to set it aside in whole or in part. The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court may order additional evidence to be taken by the Secretary, and to be made part of the record.
<br>(B) Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary—
<br>
<br>(i) may modify the findings of fact of the Secretary, or make new findings, by reason of the new evidence so taken and filed with the court; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall file—
<br>
<br>(I) such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole; and
<br>
<br>(II) the recommendation of the Secretary, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original action of the Secretary.
<br>(4) Finality
<br>
<br>Upon the filing of the record with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment shall be final, except that such judgment shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

<br>SUBCHAPTER VI—FEDERAL GUARANTEES FOR FINANCING FOR TRIBAL HOUSING ACTIVITIES
<br>§4191. Authority and requirements
<br>(a) Authority
<br>
<br>To such extent or in such amounts as provided in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of this subchapter (including limitations designed to protect and maintain the viability of rental housing units owned or operated by the recipient that were developed under a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]), and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee, the notes or other obligations issued by Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities with tribal approval, for the purposes of financing affordable housing activities described in section 4132 of this title and housing related community development activity as consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(b) Terms of loans
<br>
<br>Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.
<br>(c) Limitation on outstanding guarantees
<br>
<br>No guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be made with respect to any note or other obligation if the total outstanding notes or obligations of the issuer guaranteed under this subchapter (excluding any amount defeased under the contract entered into under section 4192(a)(1) of this title) would thereby exceed an amount equal to 5 times the amount of the grant approval for the issuer pursuant to subchapter III.
