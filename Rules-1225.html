<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any change in the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the laws of the United States shall continue to apply with respect to Hong Kong, on and after July 1, 1997, in the same manner as the laws of the United States were applied with respect to Hong Kong before such date unless otherwise expressly provided by law or by Executive order under section 5722 of this title.
<br>(b) International agreements
<br>
<br>For all purposes, including actions in any court in the United States, the Congress approves the continuation in force on and after July 1, 1997, of all treaties and other international agreements, including multilateral conventions, entered into before November 27, 2019, between the United States and Hong Kong, or entered into before November 27, 2019, between the United States and the United Kingdom and applied to Hong Kong, unless or until terminated in accordance with law. If in carrying out this subchapter, the President determines that Hong Kong is not legally competent to carry out its obligations under any such treaty or other international agreement, or that the continuation of Hong Kong's obligations or rights under any such treaty or other international agreement is not appropriate under the circumstances, such determination shall be reported to the Congress in accordance with section 5731 of this title.

<br>(b) Factor for consideration

<br>"SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
<br>
<br>"The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note above] is to amend or repeal numerous statutory provisions that restrict or otherwise impede normal relations between the United States and the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union. All of the statutory provisions amended or repealed by this Act were relevant and appropriate at the time of enactment, but with the end of the Cold War, they have become obsolete. It is not the purpose of this Act to rewrite or erase history, or to forget those who suffered in the past from the injustices or repression of communist regimes in the Soviet Union, but rather to update United States law to reflect changed international circumstances and to demonstrate for reformers and democrats in the independent states of the former Soviet Union the resolve of the people of the United States to support the process of democratic and economic reform and to conduct business with those states in a new spirit of friendship and cooperation.
<br>"SEC. 102. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds and declares as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Vancouver Declaration issued by President Clinton and President Yeltsin in April 1993 marked a new milestone in the development of the spirit of cooperation and partnership between the United States and Russia. The Congress affirms its support for the principles contained in the Vancouver Declaration.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Vancouver Declaration underscored that—
<br>
<br>"(A) a dynamic and effective partnership between the United States and Russia is vital to the success of Russia's historic transformation;
<br>
<br>"(B) the rapid integration of Russia into the community of democratic nations and the world economy is important to the national interest of the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(C) cooperation between the United States and Russia is essential to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and the promotion of democratic values, the protection of human rights, and the solution of global problems such as environmental pollution, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Congress enacted the FREEDOM Support Act (Public Law 102–511) [see Short Title note above], as well as other legislation such as the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102–228) [22 U.S.C. 2551 note] and the Former Soviet Union Demilitarization Act of 1992 (title XIV of Public Law 102–484) [22 U.S.C. 5901 et seq.], to help meet the historic opportunities and challenges presented by the transformation that has taken place, and is continuing to take place, in what once was the Soviet Union.
<br>
<br>"(4) The process of reform in Russia, Ukraine, and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union is ongoing. The holding of a referendum in Russia on April 25, 1993, that was free and fair, and that reflected the support of the Russian people for the process of continued and strengthened democratic and economic reform, represents an important and encouraging hallmark in this ongoing process.
<br>
<br>"(5) There remain in force many United States laws that are relics of the Cold War, and repeals or revisions of these provisions can play an important role in efforts to foster and strengthen the bonds of trust and friendship, as well as mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, between the United States and Russia, the United States and Ukraine, and the United States and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union.
<br>"SEC. 103. STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLICABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—There are numerous statutory provisions that were enacted in the context of United States relations with a country, the Soviet Union, that are fundamentally different from the relations that now exist between the United States and Russia, between the United States and Ukraine, and between the United States and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union.
<br>
<br>"(b) Extent of Such Provisions.—Many of the provisions referred to in subsection (a) imposed limitations specifically with respect to the Soviet Union, and its constituent republics, or utilized language that reflected the tension that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union at the time of their enactment. Other such provisions did not refer specifically to the Soviet Union, but nonetheless were directed (or may be construed as having been directed) against the Soviet Union on the basis of the relations that formerly existed between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in its role as the leading communist country.
<br>
<br>"(c) Findings and Affirmation.—The Congress finds and affirms that provisions such as those described in this section, including—
<br>
<br>"(1) section 216 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4316),
<br>
<br>"(2) sections 136 [22 U.S.C. 3943 note] and 804 [99 Stat. 449] of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public Law 99–93),
<br>
<br>"(3) section 1222 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Public Law 100–204; 101 Stat. 1411 [1414]),
<br>
<br>"(4) the Multilateral Export Control Enhancement Amendments Act (50 [App.] U.S.C. 2410 note, et seq.) [probably means former 50 U.S.C. App. 2410a note, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note now set out under former section 4601 of Title 50, War and National Defense],
<br>
<br>"(5) the joint resolution providing for the designation of 'Captive Nations Week' (Public Law 86–90) [73 Stat. 212],
<br>
<br>"(6) the Communist Control Act of 1954 (Public Law 83–637) [see Short Title note set out under section 781 of Title 50],
<br>
<br>"(7) provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), including sections 101(a)(40), 101(e)(3), and 313(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(40), (e)(3), 1424(a)(3)],
<br>
<br>"(8) section 2 of the joint resolution entitled 'A joint resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle East', approved March 9, 1957 (Public Law 85–7) [22 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.], and
<br>
<br>"(9) section 43 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286aa),
<br>
<br>should not be construed as being directed against Russia, Ukraine, or the other independent states of the former Soviet Union, connoting an adversarial relationship between the United States and the independent states, or signifying or implying in any manner unfriendliness toward the independent states."
<br>Definitions for Pub. L. 103–199
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 103–199, §3, Dec. 17, 1993, 107 Stat. 2318, provided that: "As used in this Act [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note above] (including the amendments made by this Act), the terms 'independent states of the former Soviet Union' and 'independent states' have the meaning given those terms by section 3 of the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets Support Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5801)."
<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>§5811. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) recent developments in Russia and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union present an historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful and stable international order and the integration of the independent states of the former Soviet Union into the community of democratic nations;
<br>
<br>(2) the entire international community has a vital interest in the success of this transition, and the dimension of the problems now faced in the independent states of the former Soviet Union makes it imperative for donor countries and institutions to provide the expertise and support necessary to ensure continued progress on economic and political reforms;
<br>
<br>(3) the United States is especially well-positioned because of its heritage and traditions to make a substantial contribution to this transition by building on current technical cooperation, medical, and food assistance programs, by assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and by fostering conditions that will encourage the United States business community to engage in trade and investment;
<br>
<br>(4) failure to meet the opportunities presented by these developments could threaten United States national security interests and jeopardize substantial savings in United States defense that these developments have made possible;
<br>
<br>(5) the independent states of the former Soviet Union face unprecedented environmental problems that jeopardize the quality of life and the very existence of not only their own peoples but also the peoples of other countries, and it is incumbent on the international community to assist the independent states in addressing these problems and in promoting sustainable use of resources and development;
<br>
<br>(6) the success of United States assistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union depends on—
<br>
<br>(A) effective coordination of United States efforts with similar activities of friendly and allied donor countries and of international financial institutions, and
<br>
<br>(B) reciprocal commitments by the governments of the independent states to work toward the creation of democratic institutions and an environment hospitable to foreign investment based upon the rule of law, including negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements on open trade and investment, adoption of commercial codes, establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision making, and timely payment of obligations carried over from previous governmental entities; and
<br>
<br>(7) trade and investment opportunities in the independent states of the former Soviet Union will generate employment and other economic benefits for the United States as the economies of the independent states of the former Soviet Union begin to realize their enormous potential as both customers and suppliers.

<br>Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–208, title IV, Dec. 14, 2012, 126 Stat. 1502, provided that:
<br>"SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This title may be cited as the 'Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012'.
<br>"SEC. 402. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The United States aspires to a mutually beneficial relationship with the Russian Federation based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, and supports the people of the Russian Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Russian Federation—
<br>
<br>"(A) is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the International Monetary Fund;
<br>
<br>"(B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption; and
<br>
<br>"(C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights.
<br>
<br>"(3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of international agreements and treaties, which must be observed in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the international order. Human rights are an integral part of international law, and lie at the foundation of the international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has incurred obligations to protect human rights under an international agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to the internal affairs of that country.
<br>
<br>"(4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of the Russian Federation and the international community through the creation of open and transparent markets.
<br>
<br>"(5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed to abuse their authority with impunity for political or financial gains in collusion with private entities.
<br>
<br>"(6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has estimated that bribes by individuals and businesses in the Russian Federation amount to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, an increasing share of the country's gross domestic product.
<br>
<br>"(7) Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, at the age of 37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, Russia, and is survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.
<br>
<br>"(8) On July 6, 2011, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev's Human Rights Council announced the results of its independent investigation into the death of Sergei Magnitsky. The Human Rights Council concluded that Sergei Magnitsky's arrest and detention was illegal; he was denied access to justice by the courts and prosecutors of the Russian Federation; he was investigated by the same law enforcement officers whom he had accused of stealing Hermitage Fund companies and illegally obtaining a fraudulent $230,000,000 tax refund; he was denied necessary medical care in custody; he was beaten by 8 guards with rubber batons on the last day of his life; and the ambulance crew that was called to treat him as he was dying was deliberately kept outside of his cell for one hour and 18 minutes until he was dead. The report of the Human Rights Council also states the officials falsified their accounts of what happened to Sergei Magnitsky and, 18 months after his death, no officials had been brought to trial for his false arrest or the crime he uncovered. The impunity continued in April 2012, when Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against Larisa Litvinova, the head doctor at the prison where Magnitsky died.
<br>
<br>"(9) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his repressive arrest and torture in custody by officers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies from his client, Hermitage Capital Management, reflects how deeply the protection of human rights is affected by corruption.
<br>
<br>"(10) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. Magnitsky is demonstrated by—
<br>
<br>"(A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in detention; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the impunity since his death of state officials he testified against for their involvement in corruption and the carrying out of his repressive persecution.
<br>
<br>"(11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to independently monitor prison conditions, concluded on December 29, 2009, 'A man who is kept in custody and is being detained is not capable of using all the necessary means to protect either his life or his health. This is a responsibility of a state which holds him captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei Magnitsky can be described as a breach of the right to life. The members of the civic supervisory commission have reached the conclusion that Magnitsky had been experiencing both psychological and physical pressure in custody, and the conditions in some of the wards of Butyrka can be justifiably called torturous. The people responsible for this must be punished.'.
<br>
<br>"(12) Sergei Magnitsky's experience, while particularly illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption on the rights of an individual citizen, appears to be emblematic of a broader pattern of disregard for the numerous domestic and international human rights commitments of the Russian Federation and impunity for those who violate basic human rights and freedoms.
<br>
<br>"(13) The second trial, verdict, and sentence against former Yukos executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evoke serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The lack of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, violations of due process and procedural norms, falsification or withholding of documents, denial of attorney-client privilege, and illegal detention in the Yukos case are highly troubling. The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, among others, have concluded that they were charged and imprisoned in a process that did not follow the rule of law and was politically influenced. Furthermore, senior officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, have acknowledged that the arrest and imprisonment of Khodorkovsky were politically motivated.
<br>
<br>"(14) According to Freedom House's 2011 report entitled 'The Perpetual Battle: Corruption in the Former Soviet Union and the New EU Members', '[t]he highly publicized cases of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who died in pretrial detention in November 2009 after exposing a multimillion-dollar fraud against the Russian taxpayer, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed business magnate and regime critic who was sentenced at the end of 2010 to remain in prison through 2017, put an international spotlight on the Russian state's contempt for the rule of law * * *. By silencing influential and accomplished figures such as Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky, the Russian authorities have made it abundantly clear that anyone in Russia can be silenced.'.
<br>
<br>"(15) The tragic and unresolved murders of Nustap Abdurakhmanov, Maksharip Aushev, Natalya Estemirova, Akhmed Hadjimagomedov, Umar Israilov, Paul Klebnikov, Anna Politkovskaya, Saihadji Saihadjiev, and Magomed Y. Yevloyev, the death in custody of Vera Trifonova, the disappearances of Mokhmadsalakh Masaev and Said-Saleh Ibragimov, the torture of Ali Israilov and Islam Umarpashaev, the near-fatal beatings of Mikhail Beketov, Oleg Kashin, Arkadiy Lander, and Mikhail Vinyukov, and the harsh and ongoing imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Alexei Kozlov, Platon Lebedev, and Fyodor Mikheev further illustrate the grave danger of exposing the wrongdoing of officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, or of seeking to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote internationally recognized human rights and freedoms.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to strongly support, and provide assistance to, the efforts of the Russian people to establish a vibrant democratic political system that respects individual liberties and human rights, including by enhancing the provision of objective information through all relevant media, such as Radio Liberty and the internet. The Russian Government's suppression of dissent and political opposition, the limitations it has imposed on civil society and independent media, and the deterioration of economic and political freedom inside Russia are of profound concern to the United States Government and to the American people.

<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Belarus Democracy Act of 2004'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966, was ratified by Belarus in 1973, guaranteeing Belarusians the freedom of expression and the freedom of association.
<br>
<br>"(2) Alyaksandr Lukashenka has ruled Belarus as an undemocratic dictatorship since the first presidential election in Belarus in 1994.
<br>
<br>"(3) Subsequent presidential elections in Belarus have been neither free nor fair and have been rejected by the international community as not meeting minimal electoral standards, with the jailing of opposition activists frequently used as a tool of government repression before and after the elections.
<br>
<br>"(4) In response to the repression and violence during the 2006 presidential election, Congress passed the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–480).
<br>
<br>"(5) In 2006, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13405, titled 'Blocking Property of Certain Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus' [listed in a table under section 1701 of Title 50, War and National Defense], which authorized the imposition of sanctions against persons responsible for—
<br>
<br>"(A) undermining democratic processes in Belarus; or
<br>
<br>"(B) participating in human rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus.
<br>
<br>"(6) In March 2011, the Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution 105, which—
<br>
<br>"(A) condemned the December 2010 election in Belarus as 'illegitimate, fraudulent, and not representative of the will or the aspirations of the voters in Belarus'; and
<br>
<br>"(B) called on the Lukashenka regime 'to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners in Belarus who were arrested in association with the December 19, 2010, election'.
<br>
<br>"(7) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to engage in a pattern of clear and persistent violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
<br>
<br>"(8) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to engage in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of basic principles of democratic governance, including through a series of fundamentally flawed presidential and parliamentary elections undermining the legitimacy of executive and legislative authority in that country.
<br>
<br>"(9) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to subject thousands of pro-democracy political activists and peaceful protesters to harassment, beatings, and imprisonment, particularly as a result of their attempts to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association.
<br>
<br>"(10) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to suppress independent media and journalists and to restrict access to the internet, including social media and other digital communication platforms, in violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression of those dissenting from the dictatorship of Alyaksandr Lukashenka.
<br>
<br>"(11) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues a systematic campaign of harassment, repression, and closure of nongovernmental organizations, including independent trade unions and entrepreneurs, creating a climate of fear that inhibits the development of civil society and social solidarity.
<br>
<br>"(12) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has pursued a policy undermining the country's sovereignty and independence by making Belarus political, economic, cultural, and societal interests subservient to those of Russia.
<br>
<br>"(13) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, continues to reduce the independence of Belarus through integration into a so-called 'Union State' that is under the control of Russia.
<br>
<br>"(14) In advance of the August 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, authorities acting on behalf of President Lukashenka arrested journalists, bloggers, political activists, and opposition leaders, including 3 leading presidential candidates (Syarhey Tsikhanouski, Mikalay Statkevich, and Viktar Babaryka), who were barred from running in the election by the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Belarus.
<br>
<br>"(15) While the 3 opposition candidates were imprisoned, 2 of their wives and 1 of their campaign managers (Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Veranika Tsepkala, and Maria Kalesnikava) joined together and ran in place of the candidates.
<br>
<br>"(16) Thousands of Belarusian people demonstrated their support for these candidates by attending rallies, including 1 rally that included an estimated 63,000 participants.
<br>
<br>"(17) On August, 5, 2020, the Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution 658, which calls for a free, fair, and transparent presidential election in Belarus, including the unimpeded participation of all presidential candidates.
<br>
<br>"(18) On August 9, 2020, the Government of Belarus conducted a presidential election that—
<br>
<br>"(A) was held under undemocratic conditions that did not meet international standards;
<br>
<br>"(B) involved government malfeasance and serious irregularities with ballot counting and the reporting of election results, including—
<br>
<br>"(i) early voting ballot stuffing;
<br>
<br>"(ii) ballot burning;
<br>
<br>"(iii) pressuring poll workers; and
<br>
<br>"(iv) removing bags full of ballots by climbing out of windows;
<br>
<br>"(C) included restrictive measures that impeded the work of local independent observers and did not provide sufficient notice to the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] to allow for the OSCE to monitor the elections, as is customary.
<br>
<br>"(19) Incumbent president Alyaksandr Lukashenka declared a landslide victory in the election and claimed to have received more than 80 percent of the votes cast in the election.
<br>
<br>"(20) The leading opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya—
<br>
<br>"(A) formally disputed the government's reported election results;
<br>
<br>"(B) explained that her staff had examined the election results from more than 50 polling places; and
<br>
<br>"(C) found that her share of the vote exceeded Lukashenka's share by many times.
<br>
<br>"(21) On August 10, 2020, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was detained while attending a meeting with the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Belarus and forced to flee to Lithuania under pressure from government authorities.
<br>
<br>"(22) On August 11, 2020, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevic�AE5ius announced that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was safe in Lithuania and has continued to be one of the strongest voices supporting the pro-democracy movement in Belarus within the European Union and globally.
<br>
<br>"(23) On August 18, 2020, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya announced the formation of a Coordination Council to oversee a resolution to the crisis in Belarus and a peaceful transition of power by subjecting the Council's senior members to violence, detention, and forced exile. The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has sought to stop the work of the Coordination Council.
<br>
<br>"(24) Before the European Parliament on August 25, 2020, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stressed that a 'peaceful revolution' was underway in Belarus, and that 'It is neither a pro-Russian nor anti-Russian revolution. It is neither an anti-European Union nor a pro-European Union revolution. It is a democratic revolution.'.
<br>
<br>"(25) On or around September 6, 2020, opposition leader Maria Kalesnikava and members of the Coordination Council, including Anton Ronenkov, Ivan Kravtsov, and Maxim Bogretsov, were detained by authorities who sought to forcibly expel them to Ukraine. Ms. Kalesnikava tore up her passport at the Ukrainian border in a successful effort to prevent this expulsion, subsequently disappeared, and was discovered in a Minsk prison on September 9, 2020.
<br>
<br>"(26) On August 11, 2020, the European Union High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, issued a declaration on the presidential election in Belarus stating that the elections were neither free nor fair.
<br>
<br>"(27) On August 28, 2020, United States Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun declared that the August 9th election in Belarus was fraudulent.
<br>
<br>"(28) Following Alyaksandr Lukashenka's September 23, 2020, secret inauguration, the United States, the European Union, numerous European Union member states, the United Kingdom, and Canada announced that they did not recognize Mr. Lukashenka as the legitimately elected leader of Belarus.
<br>
<br>"(29) Since the sham election on August 9, 2020, tens of thousands of Belarusian citizens have participated in daily peaceful protests calling for a new, free, and fair election, and the release of political prisoners.
<br>
<br>"(30) According to Amnesty International, on August 30, 2020, Belarusians held one of the largest protest rallies in the country's modern history in Minsk and in other cities, which was attended by at least 100,000 people who demanded the resignation of President Lukashenka and an investigation into the human rights violations in Belarus.
<br>
<br>"(31) Women have served as the leading force in demonstrations across the country, protesting the police brutality and mass detentions by wearing white, carrying flowers, forming 'solidarity chains', and unmasking undercover police trying to arrest demonstrators.
<br>
<br>"(32) The Government of Belarus has responded to the peaceful opposition protests, which are the largest in Belarus history, with a violent crackdown, including, according to the United Nations Special Rapporteur, the detention by government authorities of more than 10,000 peaceful protestors as of September 18, 2020, mostly for taking part in or observing peaceful protests, with many of these arrests followed by beatings and torture at the hands of Belarusian law enforcement.
<br>
<br>"(33) According to the Viasna Human Rights Centre, at least 450 detainees have reported being tortured or otherwise ill-treated while held in incommunicado detention for up to 10 days, including through—
<br>
<br>"(A) severe beatings;
<br>
<br>"(B) forced performance of humiliating acts; and
<br>
<br>"(C) sexual violence and other forms of violence.
<br>
<br>"(34) At least 4 Belarusians have been killed at protests, and dozens of Belarusians who were detained during the protests are still missing.
<br>
<br>"(35) The Belarus Ministry of Defense threatened to send the army to confront protestors, warning that in case of any violation of peace and order in areas around national monuments, 'you will have the army to deal with now, not the police'.
<br>
<br>"(36) The Government of Belarus, led illegally by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has consistently restricted the free flow of information to silence the opposition and to conceal the regime's violent crackdown on peaceful protestors, including by—
<br>
<br>"(A) stripping the accreditation of journalists from major foreign news outlets;
<br>
<br>"(B) detaining and harassing countless journalists.
<br>
<br>"(C) arresting dozens of journalists, 6 of whom report for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty;
<br>
<br>"(D) halting the publishing of 2 independent newspapers; and
<br>
<br>"(E) disrupting internet access;
<br>
<br>"(F) blocking more than 50 news websites that were covering the protests; and
<br>
<br>"(G) limiting access to social media and other digital communication platforms.
<br>
<br>"(37) Internet access in Belarus has been repeatedly disrupted and restricted since August 9, 2020, which independent experts and monitoring groups have attributed to government interference.
<br>
<br>"(38) Thousands of employees at Belarusian state-owned enterprises, who have been seen as Alyaksandr Lukashenka's traditional base during his 26-year rule, went on strike across the country to protest Lukashenka's illegitimate election and the subsequent crackdowns, including at some of Belarus's largest factories such as the BelAZ truck plant, the Minsk Tractor Works, and the Minsk Automobile Plant.
<br>
<br>"(39) After the employees of state media outlets walked off the job in protest rather than help report misleading government propaganda, Lukashenka confirmed that he 'asked the Russians' to send teams of Russian journalists to replace local employees.
<br>
<br>"(40) On August 19, 2020, European Council President Charles Michel announced that the European Union would impose sanctions on a substantial number of individuals responsible for violence, repression, and election fraud in Belarus.
<br>
<br>"(41) On October 2, 2020, the Department of Treasury announced new sanctions under Executive Order 13405 on eight individuals 'for their roles in the fraudulent August 9, 2020 Belarus presidential election or the subsequent violent crackdown on peaceful protesters'.
<br>
<br>"(42) Similar sanctions have also been applied to Belarusian human rights violators by the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom.
<br>
<br>"(43) Against the will of the majority of the Belarusian people—
<br>
<br>"(A) Alyaksandr Lukashenka appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to provide security assistance to his government, if requested; and
<br>
<br>"(B) President Putin has agreed to prop up the Alyaksandr Lukashenka regime by—
<br>
<br>"(i) confirming that a Russian police force was ready to be deployed if 'the situation gets out of control';
<br>
<br>"(ii) providing significant financial support; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) sending Russian propagandists to help disseminate pro-regime propaganda on Belarus state television.
<br>
<br>"(44) The Governments of the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada have—
<br>
<br>"(A) condemned the violent crackdown on peaceful protestors;
<br>
<br>"(B) refused to accept the results of the fraudulent election; and
<br>
<br>"(C) called for new free and fair elections under independent observation.

<br>
<br>"(C) the unjustified detention and forced or attempted expulsion of members of the Coordination Council in Belarus;

<br>
<br>"(4) the Chief Executive Officer of the United States Agency for Global Media, working through the Open Technology Fund and in coordination with the Secretary of State, should expand and prioritize efforts to provide anti-censorship technology and services to journalists and civil society in Belarus in order to enhance their ability to safely access or share digital news and information without fear of repercussions or surveillance; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the United States should continue to condemn the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on independent media, including the harassment and mass detentions of independent and foreign journalists and the denial of accreditation.
