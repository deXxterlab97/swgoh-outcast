<br>The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)–(17) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. Where established uses conflict, a choice has been made.
<br>
<br>In clause (1), the definition of "Territory" in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.
<br>
<br>In clause (2), a definition of "National Guard" is inserted for clarity.
<br>
<br>In clause (3)(A), the words "a land force" are substituted for 32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, §117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, §3, 43 Stat. 1081.
<br>
<br>In clauses (3) and (4), the word "Army" is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.
<br>
<br>In clauses (3) and (5), the words "unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires—" and "as provided in this title", in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words "has its officers appointed" are substituted for the word "officered", in 32:4b.
<br>
<br>In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.
<br>
<br>In clause (5)(A), the words "an air force" are substituted for the words "for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law", in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to Army National Guard), to make the definition of "Air National Guard" parallel with the definition of "Army National Guard", and to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.
<br>
<br>In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are inserted to make clear that enlistment is not the only method of becoming a member in an enlisted grade.

<br>
<br>In clause (2), the term "armed forces" is defined for legislative convenience and is defined the same as that term is defined in section 101(4) of title 10, United States Code.
<br>
<br>The definition in clause (18) reflects the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the term has been commonly used.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–241, §1, Jan. 10, 2013, 126 Stat. 2372, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) In 1629, Captain John Endicott organized the first militia in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Salem.
<br>
<br>"(2) The colonists had adopted the English militia system, which required all males between the ages of 16 and 60 to possess arms and participate in the defense of the community.
<br>
<br>"(3) In 1636, the Massachusetts General Court ordered the organization of three militia regiments, designated as the North, South, and East regiments.
<br>
<br>"(4) These regiments drilled once a week and provided guard details each evening to sound the alarm in case of attack.
<br>
<br>"(5) The East Regiment, the predecessor of the 101st Engineer Battalion, assembled as a regiment for the first time in 1637 on the Salem Common, marking the beginning of the Massachusetts National Guard and the National Guard of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(6) Since 1785, Salem's own Second Corps of Cadets (101st and 102nd Field Artillery) has celebrated the anniversary of that first muster.
<br>
<br>"(7) As the policy contained in section 102 of title 32, United States Code, clearly expresses, the National Guard continues its historic mission of providing units for the first line defense of the United States and current missions throughout the world.
<br>
<br>"(8) The designation of the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States will contribute positively to tourism and economic development in the city, create jobs, and instill pride in both the local and State communities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as National Guard Birthplace.—In light of the findings made in subsection (a), the City of Salem, Massachusetts, is hereby designated as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(c) Responsibilities.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Military ceremonial support.—The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Council of Governors, and the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts, shall provide military ceremonial support at the dedication of any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Funding source.—Federal funds may not be used to design, procure, prepare, install, or maintain any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States, but the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts may accept and expend contributions of non-Federal funds for this purpose."
<br>§102. General policy
<br>
<br>In accordance with the traditional military policy of the United States, it is essential that the strength and organization of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard as an integral part of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times. Whenever Congress determines that more units and organizations are needed for the national security than are in the regular components of the ground and air forces, the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States, or such parts of them as are needed, together with such units of other reserve components as are necessary for a balanced force, shall be ordered to active Federal duty and retained as long as so needed.

<br>
<br>(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the organization of the Army National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Army, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Army may authorize; and the organization of the Air National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Air Force, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize.
<br>
<br>(c) To secure a force the units of which when combined will form complete higher tactical units, the President may designate the units of the National Guard, by branch of the Army or organization of the Air Force, to be maintained in each State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. However, no change in the branch, organization, or allotment of a unit located entirely within a State may be made without the approval of its governor.
<br>
<br>(d) To maintain appropriate organization and to assist in training and instruction, the President may assign the National Guard to divisions, wings, and other tactical units, and may detail commissioned officers of the National Guard or of the Regular Army or the Regular Air Force, as the case may be, to command those units. However, the commanding officer of a unit organized wholly within a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands may not be displaced under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e) To insure prompt mobilization of the National Guard in time of war or other emergency, the President may, in time of peace, detail a commissioned officer of the Regular Army to perform the duties of chief of staff for each fully organized division of the Army National Guard, and a commissioned officer of the Regular Air Force to perform the duties of the corresponding position for each fully organized wing of the Air National Guard.
<br>
<br>(f) Unless the President consents—
<br>
<br>(1) an organization of the National Guard whose members have received compensation from the United States as members of the National Guard may not be disbanded; and
<br>
<br>(2) the actual strength of such an organization in commissioned officers or enlisted members may not be reduced below the minimum strength prescribed by the President.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "within their respective borders" are omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the word "Army" is substituted for the words "Regular Army", since the Army is the category for which the organization is prescribed, and the Regular Army is a personnel category for which no organization is prescribed. Similarly, the words "Air Force" are used instead of the words "Regular Air Force".
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "by branch of the Army or organization of the Air Force" are substituted for the words "as to branch or arm of service". The words "branch, organization, or allotment of a unit" are substituted for the words "allotment, branch, or arm of units or organizations".
<br>
<br>In subsections (d) and (e) the word "commissioned" is inserted, since 32:8 and 10 historically applied only to commissioned officers (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)).

Appropriations available for paying those costs shall be available for making the reimbursements.
<br>
<br>(C) To ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National Guard of a State pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan does not degrade the training and readiness of such units and personnel, the following requirements shall apply in determining the drug interdiction and counter-drug activities that units and personnel of the National Guard of a State may perform:

<br>(ii) National Guard personnel will not degrade their military skills as a result of performing the activities.
<br>
<br>(iii) The performance of the activities will not result in a significant increase in the cost of training.

<br>
<br>(3) A unit or member of the National Guard of a State may be used, pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan approved by the Secretary of Defense under this section, to provide services or other assistance (other than air transportation) to an organization eligible to receive services under section 508 of this title if—
<br>
<br>(A) the State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan specifically recognizes the organization as being eligible to receive the services or assistance;

<br>(B) in the case of services, the performance of the services meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of section 508 of this title; and
