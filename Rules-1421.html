<br>
<br>"(1) cooperation among Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies is critical to an effective national response to the problems of violent crime and drug trafficking in the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) the National Crime Information Center, which links more than 16,000 Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies, is the single most important avenue of cooperation among law enforcement agencies;
<br>
<br>"(3) major improvements to the National Crime Information Center are needed because the current system is more than twenty years old; carries much greater volumes of enforcement information; and at this time is unable to incorporate technological advances that would significantly improve its performance; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with State and local law enforcement agencies and private organizations, has developed a promising plan, 'NCIC 2000', to make the necessary upgrades to the National Crime Information Center that should meet the needs of United States law enforcement agencies into the next century.
<br>"SEC. 613. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
<br>
<br>"There are authorized to be appropriated the following sums to implement the 'NCIC 2000' project:
<br>
<br>"(1) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 1991;
<br>
<br>"(2) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1992;
<br>
<br>"(3) $22,000,000 for fiscal year 1993;
<br>
<br>"(4) $9,000,000 for fiscal year 1994; and
<br>
<br>"(5) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1995.
<br>"SEC. 614. REPORT.
<br>
<br>"By February 1 of each fiscal year for which funds for NCIC 2000 are requested, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives that details the progress that has been made in implementing NCIC 2000 and a complete justification for the funds requested in the following fiscal year for NCIC 2000."

<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 481 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–1001 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., with parts of sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of United States attorneys.
<br>
<br>The term "United States attorney" was adopted in this section for "attorney for the United States." Since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in In re Neagle, 1890 (10 S. Ct. 658, 135 U.S. 1, 34, L. Ed. 55) where the terms "attorneys of the United States" and "district attorneys" were used interchangeably, Congress has also designated such officers as either "United States attorneys" or as "district attorneys." See Acts of Feb. 22, 1886, ch. 928, §7, 24 Stat. 309; July 3, 1890, ch. 656, §16, 26 Stat. 217; July 10, 1890, ch. 664, §16, 26 Stat. 225, and Acts of July 20, 1882, ch. 312, §3, 22 Stat. 172; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 100, §3, 38 Stat. 961; May 28, 1926, ch. 414, §2(b), 44 Stat. 672.
<br>
<br>At present, such officers are invariably designated as "United States attorneys" by Federal courts and the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>Words "The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate," were inserted to conform section with the Constitution. See article II, section 2, clause 2.
<br>
<br>Words "including the District of Columbia" were omitted, because the District is made a judicial district by section 88 of this title. District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–1001, provided for appointment of an "attorney of the United States for the District" by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.
<br>
<br>Words "learned in the law" were omitted as unnecessary. Such requirement is not made of United States judges and no reason appears to make a distinction respecting United States attorneys.
<br>
<br>Parts of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., remain in said title 48. For remainder thereof, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 504 [now 541 and 544], and 541 [see 561] of this title.

<br>
<br>Reference in such section 483 to "District of Columbia" was omitted. (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)

The Attorney General, as chief law enforcement officer, is in a better position to determine such necessity.
<br>

<br>
<br>Section consolidates parts of sections 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and 643 and 863 of title 48, both U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 482 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. It is recommended that said section 315 be amended so as to omit those provisions relating to special attorneys to assist "district attorneys" which were used as part of the basis for this section, as other parts of said section 315, relating to special assistants to the Attorney General, and to foreign counsel, are to remain in title 5.
<br>
<br>Words "United States attorney" were substituted for district attorney, and reference to District of Columbia was omitted. (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)
<br>
<br>Reference to the territories in said section 482, was also omitted as covered by provisions of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions. See sections 109 and 112 of such title applicable to United States attorney in Alaska, and 1353 applicable in the Canal Zone, and 1405y applicable in the Virgin Islands.
<br>
<br>The provision as to the tenure of the assistant United States attorneys and special attorneys is new. Existing law contains no provision as to tenure or removal of such officials. While the Supreme Court has held that the power of removal of executive officials is incident to the power of appointment, this section expressly provides for removal. See Meyers v. United States, 1926 (47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160).
<br>
<br>Said section 315 contained a provision that special attorneys appointed to assist United States attorneys should take the same oath required of the latter. This section was extended to assistant United States attorneys, respecting whom no provision existed as to oaths.
<br>
<br>A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of said section 863, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 501 [now 541], and 541 [see 561] of this title.

<br>The provisions of section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States attorney shall give his personal attention to the duties of his office and declaring the office of United States attorney vacant upon his removal from his district or neglect of duty, were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with section 507(b) [now 519] of this title, charging the Attorney General with the duty of supervising the United States attorneys in the performance of their duties.
<br>
<br>The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein. Also the residence requirement of this section has no relation to domicile or voting residence nor does it affect the citizenship or residence status of District of Columbia officeholders in the several States from which appointed.

<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Prior section 506.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §511 (R.S. §793; June 24, 1898, ch. 495, §2, 30 Stat. 487; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167).
<br>
<br>Words "United States attorney" were substituted for "district attorney." (See Reviser's Note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)
<br>
<br>Words "The Supreme Court of the Territory, and the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia" were omitted as obsolete. This section, as revised, applies to all districts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title. There were no provisions respecting vacancies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Therefore this section remedies this situation and establishes a uniform method to fill interim vacancies.
<br>
<br>Words "and a copy shall be entered on the journal of the court" after "filed in the clerk's office of said court", in section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to marshals, are incorporated in sections 544 and 545 [see Prior Provisions notes under those sections] of this title.

<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Prior section 507.—Based on sections 312, 317, 323, 324, 327, 329, 330, 331 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees; second paragraph of section 305e of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians; and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§485, 486, 487, 488, 489 (R.S. §§362, 363, 373, 374, 377, 379–381, 771–775, 838; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 241; Apr. 9, 1910, ch. 152, 36 Stat. 294; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, §6, 49 Stat. 893).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates provisions of the sections enumerated above.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 503 [now 543] and 508 [now 548] of this title.
<br>
<br>All requirements in said sections for reports to officers other than the Attorney General are omitted as unnecessary and are simplified in subsection (a)(5) of this section. The Attorney General directs the course of litigation in government cases and makes appropriate rules for furnishing information promptly to the Departments interested.
<br>
<br>Specific duties fixed by sections 485—489 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the second paragraph of section 305e of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to prosecute and defend both civil and criminal proceedings, are covered in subsections (a)(1)–(4) of this section.
<br>
<br>Use of "revenue law" in subsection (a)(4) in this section, which is based on section 486 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., obviates repetition of provisions relating to customs and revenue laws as both are covered by the term. For discussion of this point, see reviser's note under section 3283 in House Report 152, to accompany H.R. 1600 Eightieth Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code.
<br>
<br>The following sections of said title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are superseded by, covered by, or inconsistent with subsection (a)(2)(5) of this section, subsection (b) of this section [now section 519 of this title], and section 5 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, transferring to the Department of Justice the function of supervising the work of United States attorneys in connection with suits by or against the United States exercised by any agency or officer:
<br>
<br>Section 323 requiring the General Counsel of the Treasury to make entries of bonds delivered to United States attorneys by collectors for suit until the amounts have been paid or judgments secured;
<br>
<br>Section 324 requiring said General Counsel to examine and compare the reports made by collectors of bonds delivered by them to United States attorneys for suit, and of the returns of such bonds;
<br>
<br>Section 329 authorizing said General Counsel to instruct United States attorneys, marshals and clerks in all matters relating to suits, except for taxes, forfeitures and penalties, and to require them to make such reports to him as he may direct. The first provision of section 329 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is covered by the last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], under which the Attorney General exercises supervision of the duties of United States attorneys. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts supervises the duties of clerks under chapter 41 of this title. The provision for authority of said General Counsel over marshals, also contained in section 329, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title in which such authority is vested in the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>Section 327 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorized said General Counsel to establish regulations, subject to approval by the Attorney General, to be observed by United States attorneys and marshals in which the United States is a party. The provision as to United States attorneys is also covered by the last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], and that as to marshals is covered by section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title.
<br>
<br>Provisions of section 327 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to establishment of regulations for the observance of collectors of the customs, by the General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury, with the approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury, was omitted and recommended for repeal as covered by section 66 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties.
<br>
<br>The last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], is based on the first clause of section 317 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed.; see also section 309 of title 5. The second clause of said section 317 is covered by subsection (a)(5) of this section. The authority of the Attorney General over marshals and the requirement that they shall report to him the conduct and state of their offices, contained also in said section 317, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 330 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which required that United States attorneys should conduct, under direction of the General Counsel of the Treasury, all suits and proceedings involving the United States under the laws governing national banking associations is covered by subsection (a)(2) of this section.
<br>
<br>Section 331 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring United States attorneys to obey directions of the Department of Justice in suits for money due the Post Office Department, is covered also by subsection (a)(2) of this section.

<br>The words "sections 5315–5317 of title 5" are substituted for "subsection (f) and (g) of section 303 of the Federal Executive Salary Act of 1964" to reflect the codification of those subsections in title 5. The words "GS–18 of the General Schedule set forth in section 5332 of title 5" are substituted for "grade 18 of the General Schedule of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended".

<br>
<br>Prior section 508.—Based on section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§579 and 580 (R.S. §363; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§8, 24, 29 Stat. 181, 186; Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1007, §1, 32 Stat. 1141; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, §1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209; June 1, 1922, ch. 204, title II (part), 42 Stat. 616; Jan. 3, 1923, ch. 21, title II, 42 Stat. 1083; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 295, 42 Stat. 1560; May 28, 1924, ch. 204, title II (part), 43 Stat. 220).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates part of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and part of section 579 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Sections 579 and 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixed specific salaries for the United States attorneys and assistants, while section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for a contractual arrangement for compensation of special attorneys.
<br>
<br>According to a Department of Justice interpretation, provisions for specific salaries were superseded by section 678 of title 5, which provides for adjustment of compensation by heads of departments. Hence, this section leaves the amount of compensation to the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>Section 578b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall be paid for their services, was omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Section 578c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall not receive fees in addition to their salaries, was omitted as obsolete, in view of this section and current practice.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 503 [now 543] and 507 [now 509 and 547] of this title, and other provisions of section 579 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 552 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title.

<br>
<br>The second paragraph of former section 509 is omitted as it was superseded by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>The second paragraph was based in part on former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926.
<br>
<br>Section 6 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in section 5706 of title 5, United States Code, substantially reenacted former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was repealed by the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, by which title 28 was originally enacted. The purpose of section 6 was to allow reimbursement for only such actual and necessary travel expenses incurred unless otherwise permitted by the Act of 1949 itself or by laws relating to the military. Section 6 did not, however, provide for the exception of United States attorneys as did former section 73.
<br>
<br>Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1949, which are codified in sections 5701 and 5702 of title 5, United States Code, defined the coverage of the Act and allowed for specific exclusions in the legislative and judicial branches but did not mention an exclusion in the executive branch for United States attorneys.
<br>
<br>Section 7 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5707 of title 5, United States Code, expressly vested in the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the authority to prescribe regulations covering travel allowances and the reimbursement of travel expenses.
<br>
<br>Section 8 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(1), (2) of title 5, United States Code, made specific exclusions from the coverage of the Act, and United States attorneys were not so excluded.
<br>
<br>Section 9 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(3), (4) of title 5, United States Code, modified acts inconsistent with the 1949 Act, and specifically mentioned acts which authorize reimbursement of "actual and necessary" expenses.
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Prior section 509.—Based on sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§586, 587 and 592 (R.S. §§368, 833, 834; Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 133, §1, 18 Stat. 452; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§13, 14, 24, 29 Stat. 183, 186; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, §1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; July 1, 1918, ch. 113, §1, 40 Stat. 683; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, §3, 56 Stat. 1089).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates parts of sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and of sections 586, 587, and 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>First paragraph of this section is from section 587 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which did not apply to Alaska because of the restriction in section 591 of said title 28. However, the latter section has been superseded, in that respect, by subsequent appropriation acts, the latest being act July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title II, 60 Stat. 460, which specifically allows office expenses for United States attorneys in Alaska. This section applies to all United States attorneys.
<br>
<br>Section 73 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., allowed only actual traveling expenses to Government employees, except "district attorneys," marshals and clerks of courts and their deputies. It has been superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926. See sections 821 et seq. of said title 5.
<br>
<br>References in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to absence "from their respective official residences" and to going to and returning from attendance before courts, etc., were omitted as surplusage and covered by the phrase "on official business." Language relating to Standardized Government Travel Regulations was also omitted as the reference in this section is to the provision in the Subsistence Expense Act, supra, authorizing those regulations. Verification under oath provision was omitted as covered by section 553 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title which simplifies procedure by requiring payment upon certification by the payee. The penal provisions of title 18 are ample protection against fraud and an oath alone is no deterrent.
<br>
<br>The requirement in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the marshals should include such payments in their accounts for auditing and allowance, was omitted as unnecessary. See section 541 et seq. [now section 561 et seq.] of this title and section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Section 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to supervise the accounts of "district" attorneys, marshals, clerks, and other court officers. The language of this section covers that requirement. The provision as to marshals is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.
<br>
<br>Quarterly expense accounts were required of United States attorneys and marshals by section 586 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such provision is omitted as unnecessary in view of this section and section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Further provisions of said section 586 that office expenses of United States attorneys, assistants, and marshals should be allowed under regulations of the Attorney General and verified under oath, are simplified by this section and section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Another provision that accounts therefor should be submitted to, examined by the district court and, when approved by the court then audited and allowed by law, was omitted. The power of the Attorney General is sufficient. The reference to audit and allowance was unnecessary as covered by section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance. Said section 586 applied also to marshals and deputies and those provisions are incorporated in section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.
<br>
<br>The exception in sections 586 and 591 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the former should not apply in Alaska was omitted as unnecessary. Section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, requires travel expense accounts to be rendered and paid as in other districts.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>
<br>Section consolidates and simplifies sections 484 and 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. For provisions with respect to classified civil service, see sections 631–684 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.
<br>
<br>Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States attorney, southern district of New York. Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys. It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.
<br>
<br>Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.
<br>
<br>Said section 593 also required that payment of salaries of such clerks and messengers be made by the disbursing clerk of the Department of Justice. Under section 550 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title the marshals will make such payments including the office expenses of United States attorneys.
<br>
<br>The restriction that section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to Alaska is omitted as unnecessary since section 109 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, authorizes employment of clerical assistants to United States attorneys in Alaska by the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary. The need may be determined by the Attorney General.

<br>Prior section 551.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§577, 578a (R.S. §846; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§6, 13, 24, 29 Stat. 179, 183, 186; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; June 6, 1930, ch. 409, 46 Stat. 522; Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, §1, 55 Stat. 736).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates first sentence of section 577 with section 578a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation. Other provisions of said section 577 are incorporated in section 1929 of this title.
<br>
<br>The qualification that payments of witness fees or costs be made upon "order of court," contained in said section 577 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as obsolete and suitable reference was made to sections 1825 and 1871 of this title under which payments are now made on certificates of attendance.
<br>
<br>Section 578a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is rewritten in simplified terms without change of substance. The proviso of such section 578a, prohibiting the collection of fees from the United States, was omitted as covered by section 2412 of this title, providing that the United States should be liable only for fees when such liability is expressly provided by Congress.
