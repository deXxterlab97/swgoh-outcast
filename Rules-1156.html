<br>§1980a. Reimbursement of owner for fee paid to navigate foreign waters if fee inconsistent with international law
<br>(a) Reimbursable fees
<br>
<br>In any case on or after June 15, 1994, in which a vessel of the United States exercising its right of passage is charged a fee by the government of a foreign country to engage in transit passage between points in the United States (including a point in the exclusive economic zone or in an area over which jurisdiction is in dispute), and such fee is regarded by the United States as being inconsistent with international law, the Secretary of State shall, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, reimburse the vessel owner for the amount of any such fee paid under protest.
<br>(b) Documentation
<br>
<br>In seeking such reimbursement, the vessel owner shall provide, together with such other information as the Secretary of State may require—
<br>
<br>(1) a copy of the receipt for payment;
<br>
<br>(2) an affidavit attesting that the owner or the owner's agent paid the fee under protest; and
<br>
<br>(3) a copy of the vessel's certificate of documentation.
<br>(c) Timeliness
<br>
<br>Requests for reimbursement shall be made to the Secretary of State within 120 days after the date of payment of the fee, or within 90 days after November 3, 1995, whichever is later.
<br>(d) Funding; appropriations
<br>
<br>Such funds as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this section may be made available from the unobligated balance of previously appropriated funds remaining in the Fishermen's Protective Fund established under section 1979 of this title. To the extent that requests for reimbursement under this section exceed such funds, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be needed for reimbursements authorized under subsection (a), which shall be deposited in the Fishermen's Protective Fund established under section 1979 of this title.
<br>(e) Claim against foreign government
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State shall take such action as the Secretary deems appropriate to make and collect claims against the foreign country imposing such fee for any amounts reimbursed under this section.
<br>(f) "Owner" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "owner" includes any charterer of a vessel of the United States.

<br>
<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 104–43, title IV, §401, Nov. 3, 1995, 109 Stat. 388, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) customary international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the waters commonly referred to as the 'Inside Passage' off the Pacific Coast of Canada;
<br>
<br>"(2) in 1994 Canada required all commercial fishing vessels of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain a 'license which authorizes transit' through the Inside Passage;
<br>
<br>"(3) this action was inconsistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and, in particular, Article 26 of that Convention, which specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety of United States commercial fishermen who sought to avoid the fee by traveling in less protected waters;
<br>
<br>"(4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 [22 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.] provides for the reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a license fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been seized, but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by the owner in advance in order to prevent a seizure;
<br>
<br>"(5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by mail;
<br>
<br>"(6) significant expense and delay was incurred by commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the Fishermen's Protective Act;
<br>
<br>"(7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with international law;
<br>
<br>"(8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;
<br>
<br>"(9) the United States should review its current policy with respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters in and near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such vessels the same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of the United States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of Canada off British Columbia;
<br>
<br>"(10) the President should ensure that, consistent with international law, the United States Coast Guard has available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels operating in disputed waters;
<br>
<br>"(11) the President should continue to review all agreements between the United States and Canada to identify other actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately implement any actions which the President deems appropriate if Canada reinstates the fee;
<br>
<br>"(12) the President should continue to convey to Canada in the strongest terms that the United States will not now, nor at any time in the future, tolerate any action by Canada which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of passage of vessels of the United States in a manner inconsistent with international law; and
<br>
<br>"(13) the United States should continue its efforts to seek expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery conservation and management measures that can be implemented through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual concern."
<br>§1980b. Sanctions for imposition of conditions on U.S. fishing vessel found inconsistent with international law
<br>(a) Certification
<br>
<br>If the Secretary of State finds that the government of any nation imposes conditions on the operation or transit of United States fishing vessels which the United States regards as being inconsistent with international law or an international agreement, the Secretary of State shall certify that fact to the President.
<br>(b) Sanctions
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of a certification under subsection (a), the President shall direct the heads of Federal agencies to impose similar conditions on the operation or transit of fishing vessels registered under the laws of the nation which has imposed conditions on United States fishing vessels.
<br>(c) "Fishing vessel" defined
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section, the term "fishing vessel" has the meaning given that term in section 2101(12) of title 46.
<br>(d) Sanctions commensurate with conditions certified
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that any action taken by any Federal agency under subsection (b) should be commensurate with any conditions certified by the Secretary of State under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(Aug. 27, 1954, ch. 1018, §12, as added Pub. L. 104–43, title IV, §402(b), Nov. 3, 1995, 109 Stat. 390; amended Pub. L. 115–232, div. C, title XXXV, §3541(b)(4), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 2323.)

Nothing in this Executive Order shall be construed (1) to modify the annual executive branch guidance to United States diplomatic posts on health, trade, and commercial aspects of tobacco, or (2) to affect any negotiating position of the United States on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
<br>
<br>(b) The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Role in Tobacco Trade Policy Deliberations. The HHS shall be included in all deliberations of interagency working groups, chaired by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), that address issues relating to trade in tobacco and tobacco products. Through such participation, HHS shall advise the USTR, and other interested Federal agencies, of the potential public health impact of any tobacco-related trade action that is under consideration. Upon conclusion of a trade agreement that includes provisions specifically addressing tobacco or tobacco products, the USTR shall produce and make publicly available a summary describing those provisions.
<br>
<br>(c) International Tobacco Control Needs Assessment. The HHS, with the cooperation of the Departments of State, Commerce, and Agriculture, and in consultation with the appropriate national Ministry of Health, shall conduct a pilot assessment of tobacco use in a country other than the United States. Such assessment will be carried out through a compilation and review of surveys and other needs assessments already available and include:
<br>
<br>(1) initial estimates of the burden of disease and other public health consequences of tobacco use;
<br>
<br>(2) the status of tobacco control regulatory measures in place to curtail tobacco consumption and tobacco related disease; and
<br>
<br>(3) an analysis of the marketing, distribution, and manufacturing practices of tobacco companies in given regions, and the impact of those practices on smoking rates, particularly among women and children. Such assessment shall be prepared and provided to interested agencies and other parties not later than December 31, 2001, and be updated as practicable.
<br>
<br>(d) Research and Training in Tobacco Control. The HHS will develop a research and training program linking institutions in the United States and certain other countries in the field of tobacco control. Emphasis will be placed on the collection of standardized and comparable surveillance data; networks for communication, information and best practices; and the development and evaluation of culturally-targeted approaches to preventing tobacco use and increasing quit rates, especially among women and children.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General. (a) Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this order to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their statutory and regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.
<br>
<br>(b) This order clarifies and strengthens Administration policy and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its officers or employees, or any other person.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—NATIONAL TOURISM POLICY
<br>§2121. Congressional findings; establishment of policy
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the tourism and recreation industries are important to the United States, not only because of the numbers of people they serve and the vast human, financial, and physical resources they employ, but because of the great benefits tourism, recreation, and related activities confer on individuals and on society as a whole;
<br>
<br>(2) the Federal Government for many years has encouraged tourism and recreation implicitly in its statutory commitments to the shorter workyear and to the national passenger transportation system, and explicitly in a number of legislative enactments to promote tourism and support development of outdoor recreation, cultural attractions, and historic and natural heritage resources;
<br>
<br>(3) as incomes and leisure time continue to increase, and as our economic and political systems develop more complex global relationships, tourism and recreation will become ever more important aspects of our daily lives; and
<br>
<br>(4) the existing extensive Federal Government involvement in tourism, recreation, and other related activities needs to be better coordinated to effectively respond to the national interest in tourism and recreation and, where appropriate, to meet the needs of State and local governments and the private sector.
<br>
<br>(b) There is established a national tourism policy to—
<br>
<br>(1) optimize the contributions of the tourism and recreation industries to the position of the United States with respect to international competitiveness, economic prosperity, full employment, and the balance of payments;
<br>
<br>(2) increase United States export earnings from United States tourism and transportation services traded internationally;
<br>
<br>(3) ensure the orderly growth and development of tourism;
<br>
<br>(4) coordinate and encourage the development of the tourism industry in rural communities which—
<br>
<br>(A) have been severely affected by the decline of agriculture, family farming, or the extraction or manufacturing industries, or by the closing of military bases; and
<br>
<br>(B) have the potential necessary to support and sustain an economy based on tourism;
<br>
<br>(5) promote increased and more effective investment in international tourism by the States, local governments, and cooperative tourism marketing programs;
