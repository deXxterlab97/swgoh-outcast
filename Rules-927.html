<br>Caribbean Basin Initiative
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 100–418, title I, §1909(a), (b), Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1317, 1318, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) Caribbean and Central American countries historically have had close economic, political, and cultural ties to the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) promoting economic and political stability in the Caribbean and Central America is in the national security interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(3) the economic and political stability of the nations of the Caribbean and Central America can be strengthened significantly by the attraction of foreign and domestic investment specifically devoted to employment generation; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the diversification of the economies and expansion of exports, particularly those of a non-traditional nature, of the nations of the Caribbean and Central America is linked directly to fair access to the markets of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(b) Intent of the Congress.—The Congress hereby expresses its intention to ensure that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the trade elements of the Caribbean Basin Initiative be strengthened in a manner consistent with the promotion of economic and political stability in the Caribbean and Central America;
<br>
<br>"(2) to the extent that Congress imposes changes that are intended to improve the competitive environment for United States industry and workers, such changes do not unduly affect the unilateral duty-free trade system available to the beneficiary countries designated under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>"(3) generic changes in the trade laws of the United States do not discriminate against imports from designated beneficiary countries in relation to imports from other United States trading partners."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon.
<br>§2703. Eligible articles
<br>(a) Growth, product, or manufacture of beneficiary countries
<br>
<br>(1) Unless otherwise excluded from eligibility by this chapter, and subject to section 423 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and except as provided in subsection (b)(2) and (3), the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to any article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country if—
<br>
<br>(A) that article is imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of (i) the cost or value of the materials produced in a beneficiary country or two or more beneficiary countries, plus (ii) the direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries is not less than 35 per centum of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered.
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B), the term "beneficiary country" includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any former beneficiary country. If the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is included with respect to an article to which this paragraph applies, an amount not to exceed 15 per centum of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered that is attributed to such United States cost or value may be applied toward determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this subsection including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under this chapter, an article must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country, or must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary country; but no article or material of a beneficiary country shall be eligible for such treatment by virtue of having merely undergone—
<br>
<br>(A) simple combining or packaging operations, or
<br>
<br>(B) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.
<br>
<br>(3) As used in this subsection, the phrase "direct costs of processing operations" includes, but is not limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and
<br>
<br>(B) dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise.
<br>
<br>Such phrase does not include costs which are not directly attributable to the merchandise concerned or are not costs of manufacturing the product, such as (i) profit, and (ii) general expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions or expenses.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding section 1311 of this title, the products of a beneficiary country which are imported directly from any beneficiary country into Puerto Rico may be entered under bond for processing or use in manufacturing in Puerto Rico. No duty shall be imposed on the withdrawal from warehouse of the product of such processing or manufacturing if, at the time of such withdrawal, such product meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>(5) The duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to an article (other than an article listed in subsection (b)) which is the growth, product, or manufacture of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico if—
<br>
<br>(A) the article is imported directly from the beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States,
<br>
<br>(B) the article was by any means advanced in value or improved in condition in a beneficiary country, and
<br>
<br>(C) if any materials are added to the article in a beneficiary country, such materials are a product of a beneficiary country or the United States.
<br>
<br>(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to liqueurs and spirituous beverages produced in the territory of Canada from rum if—
<br>
<br>(A) such rum is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country or of the Virgin Islands of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) such rum is imported directly from a beneficiary country or the Virgin Islands of the United States into the territory of Canada, and such liqueurs and spirituous beverages are imported directly from the territory of Canada into the customs territory of the United States;
<br>
<br>(C) when imported into the customs territory of the United States, such liqueurs and spirituous beverages are classified in subheading 2208.90 or 2208.40 of the HTS; and
<br>
<br>(D) such rum accounts for at least 90 percent by volume of the alcoholic content of such liqueurs and spirituous beverages.
<br>(b) Import-sensitive articles
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter does not apply to—

<br>(iv) Certain other apparel articles
<br>(I) General rule
<br>
<br>Subject to subclause (II), any apparel article classifiable under subheading 6212.10 of the HTS, except for articles entered under clause (i), (ii), (iii), (v), or (vi), if the article is both cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the United States, or one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries, or both.
<br>(II) Limitation
<br>
<br>During the 1-year period beginning on October 1, 2001, and during each of the 28 succeeding 1-year periods, apparel articles described in subclause (I) of a producer or an entity controlling production shall be eligible for preferential treatment under subparagraph (B) only if the aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that are used in the production of all such articles of that producer or entity that are entered and eligible under this clause during the preceding 1-year period is at least 75 percent of the aggregate declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all such articles of that producer or entity that are entered and eligible under this clause during the preceding 1-year period.
<br>(III) Development of procedure to ensure compliance
<br>
<br>The United States Customs Service shall develop and implement methods and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirement set forth in subclause (II). If the Customs Service finds that a producer or an entity controlling production has not satisfied such requirement in a 1-year period, then apparel articles described in subclause (I) of that producer or entity shall be ineligible for preferential treatment under subparagraph (B) during any succeeding 1-year period until the aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that are used in the production of such articles of that producer or entity entered during the preceding 1-year period is at least 85 percent of the aggregate declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all such articles of that producer or entity that are entered and eligible under this clause during the preceding 1-year period.
<br>(v) Apparel articles assembled from fabrics or yarn not widely available in commercial quantities
<br>
<br>(I) Apparel articles that are both cut (or knit-to-shape) and sewn or otherwise assembled in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries, to the extent that apparel articles of such fabrics or yarn would be eligible for preferential treatment, without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarn, under Annex 4–B of the USMCA.
<br>
<br>(II) At the request of any interested party, the President is authorized to proclaim additional fabrics and yarn as eligible for preferential treatment under subclause (I) if—
<br>
<br>(aa) the President determines that such fabrics or yarn cannot be supplied by the domestic industry in commercial quantities in a timely manner;
<br>
<br>(bb) the President has obtained advice regarding the proposed action from the appropriate advisory committee established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2155) and the United States International Trade Commission;
<br>
<br>(cc) within 60 days after the request, the President has submitted a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate that sets forth the action proposed to be proclaimed and the reasons for such actions, and the advice obtained under division (bb);
<br>
<br>(dd) a period of 60 calendar days, beginning with the first day on which the President has met the requirements of division (cc), has expired; and
<br>
<br>(ee) the President has consulted with such committees regarding the proposed action during the period referred to in division (cc).
<br>
<br>(III) If the President determines that any fabric or yarn was determined to be eligible for preferential treatment under subclause (I) on the basis of fraud, the President is authorized to remove that designation from that fabric or yarn with respect to articles entered after such removal.
<br>(vi) Handloomed, handmade, and folklore articles
<br>
<br>A handloomed, handmade, or folklore article of a CBTPA beneficiary country identified under subparagraph (C) that is certified as such by the competent authority of such beneficiary country.
<br>(vii) Special rules
<br>(I) Exception for findings and trimmings
<br>
<br>(aa) An article otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under this paragraph shall not be ineligible for such treatment because the article contains findings or trimmings of foreign origin, if such findings and trimmings do not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled product. Examples of findings and trimmings are sewing thread, hooks and eyes, snaps, buttons, "bow buds", decorative lace, trim, elastic strips, zippers, including zipper tapes and labels, and other similar products. Elastic strips are considered findings or trimmings only if they are each less than 1 inch in width and are used in the production of brassieres.
<br>
<br>(bb) In the case of an article described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, sewing thread shall not be treated as findings or trimmings under this subclause.
<br>(II) Certain interlining
<br>
<br>(aa) An article otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under this paragraph shall not be ineligible for such treatment because the article contains certain interlinings of foreign origin, if the value of such interlinings (and any findings and trimmings) does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article.
<br>
<br>(bb) Interlinings eligible for the treatment described in division (aa) include only a chest type plate, "hymo" piece, or "sleeve header", of woven or weft-inserted warp knit construction and of coarse animal hair or man-made filaments.

<br>(cc) The treatment described in this subclause shall terminate if the President makes a determination that United States manufacturers are producing such interlinings in the United States in commercial quantities.
<br>(III) De minimis rule
<br>
<br>An article that would otherwise be ineligible for preferential treatment under this paragraph because the article contains fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries shall not be ineligible for such treatment if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of the good. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an apparel article containing elastomeric yarns shall be eligible for preferential treatment under this paragraph only if such yarns are wholly formed in the United States.
<br>(IV) Special origin rule
<br>
<br>An article otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under clause (i), (ii), or (ix) of this subparagraph shall not be ineligible for such treatment because the article contains nylon filament yarn (other than elastomeric yarn) that is classifiable under subheading 5402.10.30, 5402.10.60, 5402.31.30, 5402.31.60, 5402.32.30, 5402.32.60, 5402.41.10, 5402.41.90, 5402.51.00, or 5402.61.00 of the HTS duty-free from—

<br>
<br>(bb) a USMCA country (as defined in section 4502 of this title).
<br>(V) Thread

<br>(viii) Textile luggage
<br>
<br>Textile luggage—
<br>
<br>(I) assembled in a CBTPA beneficiary country from fabric wholly formed and cut in the United States, from yarns wholly formed in the United States, that is entered under subheading 9802.00.80 of the HTS; or
<br>
<br>(II) assembled from fabric cut in a CBTPA beneficiary country from fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States.
<br>(ix) Apparel articles assembled in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries from United States and CBTPA beneficiary country components
<br>
<br>Apparel articles sewn or otherwise assembled in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries with thread formed in the United States from components cut in the United States and in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries from fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States, or from components knit-to-shape in the United States and one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries from yarns wholly formed in the United States, or both (including fabrics not formed from yarns, if such fabrics are classifiable under heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTS). Apparel articles shall qualify under this clause only if they meet the requirements of clause (i) or (ii) (as the case may be) with respect to dyeing, printing, and finishing of knit and woven fabrics from which the articles are assembled.
<br>(B) Preferential treatment
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (E), during the transition period, the articles to which this subparagraph applies shall enter the United States free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions, limitations, or consultation levels.

<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A)(vi), the President shall consult with representatives of the CBTPA beneficiary countries concerned for the purpose of identifying particular textile and apparel goods that are mutually agreed upon as being handloomed, handmade, or folklore goods of a kind described in article 6.2 of the USMCA.
<br>(D) Penalties for transshipments
<br>(i) Penalties for exporters
<br>
<br>If the President determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in transshipment with respect to textile or apparel articles from a CBTPA beneficiary country, then the President shall deny all benefits under this chapter to such exporter, and any successor of such exporter, for a period of 2 years.
<br>(ii) Penalties for countries
<br>
<br>Whenever the President finds, based on sufficient evidence, that transshipment has occurred, the President shall request that the CBTPA beneficiary country or countries through whose territory the transshipment has occurred take all necessary and appropriate actions to prevent such transshipment. If the President determines that a country is not taking such actions, the President shall reduce the quantities of textile and apparel articles that may be imported into the United States from such country by the quantity of the transshipped articles multiplied by 3, to the extent consistent with the obligations of the United States under the WTO.
<br>(iii) Transshipment described
<br>
<br>Transshipment within the meaning of this subparagraph has occurred when preferential treatment under subparagraph (B) has been claimed for a textile or apparel article on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components. For purposes of this clause, false information is material if disclosure of the true information would mean or would have meant that the article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under subparagraph (B).
<br>(E) Bilateral emergency actions
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The President may take bilateral emergency tariff actions of a kind described in section 4 of the Annex with respect to any apparel article imported from a CBTPA beneficiary country if the application of tariff treatment under subparagraph (B) to such article results in conditions that would be cause for the taking of such actions under such section 4 with respect to a like article described in the same 8-digit subheading of the HTS that is imported from Mexico.
<br>(ii) Rules relating to bilateral emergency action
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying bilateral emergency action under this subparagraph—
<br>
<br>(I) the requirements of paragraph (5) of section 4 of the Annex (relating to providing compensation) shall not apply;
<br>
<br>(II) the term "transition period" in section 4 of the Annex shall have the meaning given that term in paragraph (5)(D) of this subsection; and
<br>

<br>(3) Transition period treatment of certain other articles originating in beneficiary countries
<br>(A) Equivalent tariff treatment
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), the tariff treatment accorded at any time during the transition period to any article referred to in any of subparagraphs (B) through (F) of paragraph (1) that is a CBTPA originating good shall be identical to the tariff treatment that is accorded at such time under Annex 2–B of the USMCA to an article described in the same 8-digit subheading of the HTS that is a good of Mexico and is imported into the United States.
<br>(ii) Exception
<br>
<br>Clause (i) does not apply to any article accorded duty-free treatment under U.S. Note 2(b) to subchapter II of chapter 98 of the HTS.
<br>(iii) Certain footwear
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B) and clause (i) of this subparagraph, footwear provided for in any of subheadings 6403.59.60, 6403.91.30, 6403.99.60, and 6403.99.90 of the HTS shall be eligible for the duty-free treatment provided for under this chapter if—
<br>
<br>(I) the article of footwear is the growth, product, or manufacture of a CBTPA beneficiary country; and
<br>
<br>(II) the article otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (a), except that in applying such subsection, "CBTPA beneficiary country" shall be substituted for "beneficiary country" each place it appears.
<br>(B) Relationship to subsection (h) duty reductions
<br>
<br>If at any time during the transition period the rate of duty that would (but for action taken under subparagraph (A)(i) in regard to such period) apply with respect to any article under subsection (h) is a rate of duty that is lower than the rate of duty resulting from such action, then such lower rate of duty shall be applied for the purposes of implementing such action.
<br>(4) Customs procedures
<br>(A) In general
<br>(i) Regulations
<br>
<br>Any importer that claims preferential treatment under paragraph (2) or (3) shall comply with customs procedures similar in all material respects to the requirements of article 5.4.1 of the USMCA as implemented pursuant to United States law, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(ii) Determination
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>In order to qualify for the preferential treatment under paragraph (2) or (3) and for a Certificate of Origin to be valid with respect to any article for which such treatment is claimed, there shall be in effect a determination by the President that each country described in subclause (II)—
<br>
<br>(aa) has implemented and follows; or
<br>
<br>(bb) is making substantial progress toward implementing and following,
<br>
<br>procedures and requirements similar in all material respects to the relevant procedures and requirements under chapter 5 of the USMCA.

<br>(B) Certificate of origin
<br>
<br>The Certificate of Origin that otherwise would be required pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be required in the case of an article imported under paragraph (2) or (3) if such Certificate of Origin would not be required under article 5.5 of the USMCA (as implemented pursuant to United States law), if the article were imported from Mexico.
<br>(C) Report by USTR on cooperation of other countries concerning circumvention
<br>
<br>The United States Commissioner of Customs shall conduct a study analyzing the extent to which each CBTPA beneficiary country—
<br>
<br>(i) has cooperated fully with the United States, consistent with its domestic laws and procedures, in instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention of existing quotas on imports of textile and apparel goods, to establish necessary relevant facts in the places of import, export, and, where applicable, transshipment, including investigation of circumvention practices, exchanges of documents, correspondence, reports, and other relevant information, to the extent such information is available;
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) as a result of the monitoring of the operation of the Plan under paragraph (5), the President determines that a beneficiary country is not making a good faith effort to implement its Plan, or that the measures and proposals in the Plan, although being implemented, are not achieving their purposes.
<br>
<br>(3) Before the President suspends duty-free treatment by reason of paragraph (2)(A), (B), or (C) to the sugar and beef products of a beneficiary country, he must offer to enter into consultation with the beneficiary country for purposes of formulating appropriate remedial action which may be taken by that country to avoid such suspension.

<br>
<br>(2) In any report by the International Trade Commission to the President under section 202(f) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(f)] regarding any article for which duty-free treatment has been proclaimed by the President pursuant to this chapter, the Commission shall state whether and to what extent its findings and recommendations apply to such article when imported from beneficiary countries.

<br>(3) For purposes of subsections 2 section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253(a), (c)], the suspension of the duty-free treatment provided by this chapter shall be treated as an increase in duty.
<br>
<br>(4) No proclamation which provides solely for a suspension referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection with respect to any article shall be taken under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] unless the United States International Trade Commission, in addition to making an affirmative determination with respect to such article under section 202(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(b)], determines in the course of its investigation under such section that the serious injury (or threat thereof) substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article results from the duty-free treatment provided by this chapter.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) Any action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] that is in effect when duty-free treatment pursuant to section 2701 1 of this title is proclaimed shall remain in effect until modified or terminated.
<br>
<br>(B) If any article is subject to any such action at the time duty-free treatment is proclaimed pursuant to section 2701 1 of this title, the President may reduce or terminate the application of such action to the importation of such article from beneficiary countries prior to the otherwise scheduled date on which such reduction or termination would occur pursuant to the criteria and procedures of section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253].
<br>(f) Petitions to International Trade Commission
<br>
<br>(1) If a petition is filed with the International Trade Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251] regarding a perishable product and alleging injury from imports from beneficiary countries, then the petition may also be filed with the Secretary of Agriculture with a request that emergency relief be granted pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection with respect to such article.
<br>
<br>(2) Within fourteen days after the filing of a petition under paragraph (1) of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) if the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that a perishable product from a beneficiary country is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a perishable product like or directly competitive with the imported product and that emergency action is warranted, he shall advise the President and recommend that the President take emergency action; or
<br>
