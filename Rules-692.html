<br>
<br>(11) make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether a recipient of or participant in any assistance under this chapter or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a recipient or participant, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation.

All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found;

<br>
<br>(D) to recover the direct, incremental cost involved in the production and dissemination of compilations of information produced by the Administration under the authority of this chapter and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.];
<br>
<br>(13) collect, retain and utilize, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, any amounts collected by fiscal transfer agents and not used by such agent as payment of the cost of loan pooling or debenture servicing operations, except that amounts collected under this paragraph and paragraph (12) shall be utilized solely to facilitate the administration of the program that generated the excess amounts; and
<br>
<br>(14) require any lender authorized to make loans under section 636 of this title to pay examination and review fees, which shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and shall be available for the costs of examinations, reviews, and other lender oversight activities.

<br>(e) Undertaking or suspension of payment obligation; period; extension of maturity; repayment agreement; "required payments" defined
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to the requirements and conditions contained in this subsection, upon application by a small business concern which is the recipient of a loan made under this chapter, the Administration may undertake the small business concern's obligation to make the required payments under such loan or may suspend such obligation if the loan was a direct loan made by the Administration. While such payments are being made by the Administration pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the small business concern.
<br>
<br>(2) The Administration may undertake or suspend for a period of not to exceed 5 years any small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if—
<br>
<br>(A) without such undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become insolvent or remain insolvent;
<br>
<br>(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become or remain a viable small business entity; and

<br>
<br>(4)(A) Prior to the undertaking or suspension by the Administration of any small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Administration, consistent with the purposes sought to be achieved herein, shall require the small business concern to agree in writing to repay to it the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which such obligation was undertaken or suspended, either—
<br>
<br>(i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period, or
<br>
<br>(ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Administration and the small business concern, or
<br>
<br>(iii) by a combination of the payments described in clause (i) and clause (ii).
<br>
<br>(B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A), the Administration shall, prior to the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action, and require the small business concern to take such action as the Administration deems appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Administration deems necessary or appropriate to insure that the rights and interests of the lender (Small Business Administration or participant) will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.
<br>
<br>(5) The term "required payments" with respect to any loan means payments of principal and interest under the loan.
<br>(f) Sale of guaranteed portion of loans by lender or subsequent holder; limitations; secondary market
<br>
<br>(1) The guaranteed portion of any loan made pursuant to this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, consistent with regulations on such sales as the Administration shall establish, subject to the following limitations:

<br>
<br>(B) all fees due the Administration on a guaranteed loan shall have been paid in full prior to any sale; and

<br>(C) each loan, except each loan made under section 636(a)(14) of this title, shall have been fully disbursed to the borrower prior to any sale.
<br>
<br>(2) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Administration, and shall continue to service the loan in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of such agreement.
<br>
<br>(3) The Administration shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for assessing the increase of small business access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations. Beginning on March 31, 1997, the sale of the unguaranteed portion of any loan made under section 636(a) of this title shall not be permitted until a final regulation that applies uniformly to both depository institutions and other lenders is promulgated by the Administration setting forth the terms and conditions under which such sales can be permitted, including maintenance of appropriate reserve requirements and other safeguards to protect the safety and soundness of the program.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to section 636(a) of this title, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title or subsection (e) of this section.

Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.
<br>

Any such fee imposed by the Administration shall be collected by the Administration or by the agent which carries out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions required by subsection (h) of this section and shall be paid to the Administration and used solely to reduce the subsidy on loans guaranteed under section 636(a) of this title: Provided, That such fee shall not be charged to the borrower whose loan is guaranteed: and, Provided further, That nothing herein shall preclude any agent of the Administration from collecting a fee approved by the Administration for the functions described in subsection (h)(2).1
<br>
<br>(B) The Administration is authorized to impose and collect, either directly or through a fiscal and transfer agent, a reasonable penalty on late payments of the fee authorized under subparagraph (A) in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of such fee per month plus interest.
<br>
<br>(C) The Administration may contract with an agent to carry out, on behalf of the Administration, the assessment and collection of the annual fee established under section 636(a)(23) of this title. The agent may receive, as compensation for services, any interest earned on the fee while in the control of the agent before the time at which the agent is contractually required to remit the fee to the Administration.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.
<br>
<br>(B) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.
<br>
<br>(6) If the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under section 636(a) of this title is more than $500,000, the Administrator shall, upon request of a pool assembler, divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000. Only 1 increment of any loan guarantee divided under this paragraph may be included in the same pool. Increments of loan guarantees to different borrowers that are divided under this paragraph may be included in the same pool.
<br>(h) Central registration of loans and trust certificates; contracts with agent; disclosures by sellers of guaranteed portions of loans; regulation of brokers and dealers; electronic registration
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Administration shall—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) contract with an agent to carry out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions of this section and the issuance of trust certificates to facilitate pooling. Such agent shall provide a fidelity bond or insurance in such amounts as the Administration determines to be necessary to fully protect the interest of the Government;
<br>
<br>(C) prior to any sale, require the seller to disclose to a purchaser of the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to the purchaser of a trust certificate issued pursuant to subsection (g), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this paragraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term "seller" does not include (A) an entity which made the loan or (B) any individual or entity which sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year; and
<br>
<br>(D) have the authority to regulate brokers and dealers in guaranteed loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
