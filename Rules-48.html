<br> 
<br>11	And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not this David, the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<br>12	But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis, the king of Geth.
<br>13	And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.
<br>14	And Achis said to his servants: You saw the man was mad: why have you brought him to me?
<br>15	Have we need of mad men, that you have brought in this fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>David therefore went from thence, and fled to the cave of Odollam. And when his brethren, and all his father’s house, had heard of it, they went down to him thither.
<br>2	And all that were in distress, and oppressed with debt, and under affliction of mind, gath- ered themselves unto him: and he became their prince, and there were with him about four hun- dred men.
<br>3	And David departed from thence into Mas- pha of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab: Let my father and my mother tarry with you, I beseech thee, till I know what God will do for me.
<br>4	And he left them under thc eyes of the king of Moab, and they abode with him all the days that David was in the hold.
<br>5	And Gad the prophet said to David: Abide
<br> 
<br>not in the hold, depart, and go into the land of Juda. And David departed, and came into the forest of Haret.
<br>6	And SauI heard that David was seen, and the men that were with him. Now whilst Saul abode in Gabaa, and was in the wood, which is by Rama, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him,
<br>7	He said to his servants that stood about him: Hear me now, ye sons of Jemini: will the son of Isai give every one of you fields, and vineyards, and make you all tribunes, and centurions:
<br>8	That all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me, especially when even my son hath entered into league with the son of Isai? There is not one of you that pitieth my case, nor that giveth me any information: be- cause my son hath raised up my servant against me, plotting against me to this day.
<br>9	And Doeg, the Edomite, who stood by, and was the chief among the servants of Saul, an- swering, said: I saw the son of Isai, in Nobe, with Achimelech, the son of Achitob, the priest. 10 And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of
<br>Goliath, the Philistine.
<br>11	Then the king sent to call for Achimelech, the priest, the son of Achitob, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nobe, and they came all of them to the king.
<br>12	And Saul said to Achimelech: Hear, thou son of Achitob. He answered: Here I am, my lord.
<br>13	And Saul said to him: Why have you con- spired against me, thou, and the son of Isai, and thou hast given him bread and a sword, and hast consulted the Lord for him, that he should rise up against me, continuing a traitor to this day.
<br>14	And Achimelech answering the king, said: And who amongst all thy servants is so faithful
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>as David, who is the king’s son in law, and goeth forth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house?
<br>15	Did I begin to day to consult the Lord for him? far be this from me: let not the king sus- pect such a thing against his servant, or any one in all my father’s house: for thy servant knew nothing of this matter, either little or great.
<br>16	And the king said: Dying thou shalt die, Achimelech, thou and all thy father’s house.
<br>17	And the king said to the messengers that stood about him: Turn, and kill the priests of the Lord, for their hand is with David, because they knew that he was fled, and they told it not to me. And the king’sservants would not put forth their hands against the priests of the Lord.
<br>18	And the king said to Doeg: Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg, the Edomite, turned, and fell upon the priests, and slew in that day eighty-five men that wore the linen ephod.
<br>19	And Nobe, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and ox, and ass, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
<br>20	But one of the sons of Achimelech, the son of Achitob, whose name was Abiathar, escaped, and fled to David,
<br>21	And told him that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.
<br>22	And David said to Abiathar: I knew that day when Doeg, the Edomite, was there, that without doubt he would tell Saul: I have been the occasion of the death of all the souls of thy father’s house.
<br>23	Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life also, and with me thou shalt be saved.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And they told David, saying: Behold the Philistines fight against Ceila, and they rob the barns.
<br>2	Therefore David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go, and thou shalt smite the Philistines, and shalt save Ceila.
<br>3	And the men that were with David, said to him: Behold we are in fear here in Judea, how much more if we go to Ceila against the bands of the Philistines?
<br>4	Therefore David consulted the Lord again. And he answered and said to him: Arise, and go to Ceila: for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<br>5	David, therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter of them: and David saved the inhabitants of Ceila. 6 Now at that time, when Abiathar, the son of Achimelech, fled to David, to Ceila, he came
<br>down, having an ephod with him.
<br>7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being come into a city that hath gates and bars.
<br>8	And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila, and to besiege David and his men.
<br>9	Now when David understood that Saul se- cretly prepared evil against him, he said to Abi- athar, the priest: Bring hither the ephod.
<br>10	And David said: O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath heard a report, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy the city for my sake: 11 Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands? and will Saul come down, as thy ser- vant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell thy
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>servant. And the Lord said: He will come down. 12 And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me and my men into the hands of Saul?
<br>And the Lord said: They will deliver thee up.
<br>13	Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose, and departing from Ceila, wandered up and down, uncertain where they should stay: and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila, and had escaped: wherefore he forbore to go out.
<br>14	But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he remained in a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.
<br>15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life. And David was in the desert of Ziph, in a wood.
<br>16	And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose, and went to David, into the wood, and strengthened his hands in God: and he said to him:
<br>17	Fear not: for the hand of my father, Saul, shall not find thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; yea and my father knoweth this.
<br>18	And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the wood: but Jonathan returned to his house.
<br>19	And the Ziphites went up to Saul, in Gabaa, saying: Lo, doth not David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in mount Hachila, which is on the right hand of the desert. 20 Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come down: and it shall be our busi-
<br>ness to deliver him into the king’s hands.
<br>21	And Saul said: Blessed be ye of the Lord, for you have pitied my case.
<br>22	Go, therefore, I pray you, and use all dili- gence, and curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him
<br> 
<br>there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait for him.
<br>23	Consider, and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is hid, and return to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may go with you. And if he should even go down into the earth to hide himself, I will search him out in all the thousands of Juda.
<br>24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: and David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the plain at the right hand of Jesi- mon.
<br>25	Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told David, and forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<br>26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and his men were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about, to take them.
<br>27	And a messenger came to Saul, saying: Make haste to come, for the Philistines have poured in themselves upon the land.
<br>28	Wherefore Saul returned, leaving the pur- suit of David, and went to meet the Philistines. For this cause they called that place the rock of division.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds of Engaddi.
<br>2	And when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, they told him, saying: Behold, David is in the desert of Engaddi.
<br>3	Saul, therefore, took three thousand chosen
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>men out of all Israel, and went out to seek after David and his men, even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats.
<br>4	And he came to the sheepcotes which were in his way. And there was a cave, into which Saul went, to ease nature: now David and his men lay hid in the inner part of the cave.
<br>5	And the servants of David said to him: Be- hold the day, of which the Lord said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee, that thou mayst do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. Then David arose, and secretly cut off the hem of Saul’s robe.
<br>6	After which David’s heart struck him, be- cause he had cut off the hem of Saul’s robe.
<br>7	And he said to his men: The Lord be merci- ful unto me, that I may do no such thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord’s anointed.
<br>8	And David stopped his men with his words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul: but Saul, rising up out of the cave, went on his way. 9 And David also rose up after him: and go- ing out of the cave, cried after Saul, saying:  My lord the king. And Saul looked behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground, wor-
<br>shipped,
<br>10 And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men that say: David seeketh thy hurt? 12 Moreover, see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand, that when I cut off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no evil in my hand, nor iniquity, neither have I sinned against thee: but thou liest in wait for
<br>my life, to take it away.
<br>13	The Lord judge between me and thee and the Lord revenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
<br>14	As also it is said in the old proverb: From
<br> 
<br>the wicked shall wickedness come forth: there- fore my hand shall not be upon thee. After whom dost thou come out, O king of Israel?
<br>15	After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.
<br>16	Be the Lord judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and judge my cause, and de- liver me out of thy hand.
<br>17	And when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, Saul said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept:
<br>18	And he said to David: Thou art more just than I: for thou hast done good to me, and I have rewarded thee with evil.
<br>19	And thou hast shewed this day what good things thou hast done to me: how the Lord deliv- ered me into thy hand, and thou hast not killed me.
<br>20	For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go well away? But the Lord reward thee for this good turn, for what thou hast done to me this day.
<br>21	And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and have the kingdom of Israel in thy hand:
<br>22	Swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, nor take away my name from the house of my father.
<br>23	And David swore to Saul. So Saul went home: and David and his men went up into safer places.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>And Samuel died, and all Israel was gathered together, and they mourned for him, and buried him in his house in Ramatha. And David rose, and went down into the wilderness of Pharan.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	Now there was a certain man in the wilder- ness of Maon, and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<br>3	Now the name of the man was Nabal: and the name of his wife was Abigail. And she was a prudent and very comely woman: but her hus- band was churlish, and very bad and ill natured: and he was of the house of Caleb.
<br>4	And when David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
<br>5	He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.
<br>6	And you shall say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and peace to thy house, and peace to all that thou hast.
<br>7	I have heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the desert were shearing: we never molested them, neither was there ought missing to them of the flock at any time, all the while they were with us in Carmel.
<br>8	Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a good day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son David.
<br>9	And when David’s servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David’s name, and then held their peace.
<br>10	But Nabal answering the servants of David, said: Who is David? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now days who flee from their masters.
<br>11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?
<br> 
<br>12	So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.
<br>13	Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on his sword. And they girded on every man his sword. And David also girded on his sword: and there followed David about four hundred men, and two hundred remained with the baggage.
<br>14	But one of the servants told, Abigail, the wife of Nabal, saying: Behold, David sent mes- sengers out of the wilderness, to salute our mas- ter: and he rejected them.
<br>15	These men were very good to us, and gave us no trouble: Neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in the desert.
<br>16	They were a wall unto us, both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<br>17	Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do: for evil is determined against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is a son of Belial, so that no man can speak to him.
<br>18	Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dry figs, and laid them upon asses:
<br>19	And she said to her servants: Go before me: behold, I will follow after you: but she told not her husband, Nabal.
<br>20	And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down to the foot of the mountain, David and his men came down over against her, and she met them.
<br>21	And David said: Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to this fellow in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that pertained unto
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him: and he hath returned me evil for good.
<br>22 May God do so and so, and add more to the foes of David, if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that pisseth against the wall.
<br>23 And when Abigail saw David, she made haste and lighted off the ass, and fell before David, on her face, and adored upon the ground. 24 And she fell at his feet, and said: Upon me let this iniquity be, my lord: let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in thy ears, and hear the
<br>words of thy servant.
<br>25	Let not my lord the king, I pray thee, re- gard this naughty man, Nabal: for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with him: but I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom thou sentest.
<br>26	Now therefore, my lord, the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, who hath withholden thee from coming to blood, and hath saved thy hand to thee: and now let thy enemies be as Nabal, and all they that seek evil to my lord.
<br>27	Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath brought to thee, my lord: and give it to the young men that follow thee, my lord.
<br>28	Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid: for the Lord will surely make for my lord a faithful house, because thou, my lord, fightest the battles of the Lord: let not evil therefore be found in thee all the days of thy life.
<br>29	For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of the living, with the Lord thy God: but the souls of thy enemies shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.
<br>30	And when the Lord shall have done to thee, my lord, all the good that he hath spoken con- cerning thee, and shall have made thee prince
<br> 
<br>over Israel,
<br>32	And David said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy speech:
<br>33	And blessed be thou, who hast kept me to day from coming to blood, and revenging me with my own hand.
<br>34	Otherwise, as the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, who hath withholden me from doing thee any evil, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light, any that pisseth against the wall. 35 And David received at her hand all that she had brought him, and said to her: Go in peace into thy house, behold I have heard thy voice,
<br>and honoured thy face.
<br>36	And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king: and Nabal’s heart was merry, for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning.
<br>37	But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
<br>38	And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
<br>39	And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.
<br>40	And David’s servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying: David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.
<br>41	And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth, and said: Behold,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
<br>42	And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass, and five damsels went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed the messen- gers of David, and became his wife.
<br>43	Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they were both of them his wives.
<br>44	But Saul gave Michol, his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti, the son of Lais, who was of Gallim.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And the men of Ziph came to Saul in Gabaa, saying: Behold David is hid in the hill of Hachila, which is over against the wilderness.
<br>2	And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph having with him three thou- sand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<br>3	And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over against the wilderness in the way: and David abode in the wilderness. And seeing that Saul was come after him into the wilderness, 4 He sent spies, and learned that he was most
<br>certainly come thither.
<br>5	And David arose secretly, and came to the place where Saul was: and when he had beheld the place, wherein Saul slept, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his army, and Saul sleeping in a tent, and the rest of the multitude round about him,
<br>6	David spoke to Achimelech, the Hethite, and Abisai, the son of Sarvia, the brother of Joab, saying: Who will go down with me to Saul into the camp? And Abisai said: I will go with thee. 7 So David and Abisai came to the people by night, and found Saul lying and sleeping in the
<br> 
<br>tent, and his spear fixed in the ground at his head: and Abner and the people sleeping round about him.
<br>8	And Abisai said to David: God hath shut up thy enemy this day into thy hands: now then I will run him through with my spear, even to the earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second time.
<br>9	And David said to Abisai: Kill him not: for who shall put forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and shall be guiltless?
<br>10	And David said: As the Lord liveth, unless the Lord shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down to battle, and perish: 11 The Lord be merciful unto me, and keep me that I never put forth my hand against the Lord’s anointed. But now take the spear which is at his head, and the cup of water, and let us
<br>go.
<br>12	So David took the spear, and the cup of water which was at Saul’s head, and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it, or awaked, but they were all asleep, for a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.
<br>13	And when David was gone over to the other side, and stood on the top of the hill afar off, and a good space was between them,
<br>14	David cried to the people, and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying: Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answering, said: Who art thou, that criest, and disturbest the king?
<br>15	And David said to Abner: Art not thou a man? and who is like unto thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord.
<br>16	This thing is not good, that thou hast done: as the Lord liveth, you are the sons of death, who have not kept your master, the Lord’s anointed. And now where is the king’s spear, and the cup
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of water, which was at his head?
<br>17	And Saul knew David’s voice, and said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said: It is my voice, my lord the king.
<br>18	And he said: Wherefore doth my lord per- secute his servant? What have I done? or what evil is there in my hand?
<br>19	Now therefore hear, I pray thee, my lord the king, the words of thy servant: If the Lord stir thee up against me, let him accept of sacri- fice: but if the sons of men, they are cursed in the sight of the Lord, who have cast me out this day, that I should not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve strange gods.
<br>20	And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as the partridge is hunted in the mountains.
<br>21	And Saul said: I have sinned; return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm, be- cause my life hath been precious in thy eyes this day: for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and have been ignorant in very many things.
<br>22	And David answering, said: Behold the king’s spear: let one of the king’s servants come over and fetch it.
<br>23	And the Lord will reward every one accord- ing to his justice, and his faithfulness: for the Lord hath delivered thee this day into my hand, and I would not put forth my hand against the Lord’s anointed.
<br>24	And as thy life hath been much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me from all distress.
<br>25	Then Saul said to David: Blessed art thou, my son David: and truly doing thou shalt do, and prevailing thou shalt prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And David said in his heart: I shall one day or other fall into the hands of Saul: is it not better for me to flee, and to be saved in the land of the Philistines, that Saul may despair of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will flee then out of his hands.
<br>2	And David arose, and went away, both he and the six hundred men that were with him, to Achis, the son of Maoch, king of Geth.
<br>3	And David dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his men; every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Achinoam, the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
<br>4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.
<br>5	And David said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
<br>6	Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason Siceleg belongeth to the kings of Juda unto this day.
<br>7	And the time that David dwelt in the coun- try of the Philistines, was four months.
<br>8	And David and his men went up, and pil- laged Gessuri, and Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of the coun- tries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of Egypt.
<br>9	And David wasted all the land, and left neither man nor woman alive: and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achis.
<br>10	And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against to day? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Jer-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ameel, and against the south of Ceni.
<br>11	And David saved neither man nor woman, neither brought he any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So did David, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
<br>12	And Achis believed David, saying: He hath done much harm to his people Israel: Therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered together their armies, to be prepared for war against Israel: And Achis said to David: Know thou now assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to the war, thou, and thy men.
<br>2	And David said to Achis: Now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achis said to David: And I will appoint thee to guard my life for ever.
<br>3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel mourned for him, and buried him in Ramatha, his city. And Saul had put away all the magi- cians and soothsayers out of the land.
<br>4	And the Philistines were gathered together, and came and encamped in Sunam: and Saul also gathered together all Israel, and came to Gelboe.
<br>5	And Saul saw the army of the Philistines, and was afraid, and his heart was very much dismayed.
<br>6	And he consulted the Lord, and he answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by priests, nor by prophets.
<br>7	And Saul said to his servants: Seek me a woman that hath a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire by her. And his servants said
<br> 
<br>to him: There is a woman that hath a divining spirit at Endor.
<br>8	Then he disguised himself: and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night, and he said to her: Divine to me by thy divining spirit, and bring me up him whom I shall tell thee.
<br>9	And the woman said to him: Behold thou knowest all that Saul hath done, and how he hath rooted out the magicians and soothsayers from the land: why then dost thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to be put to death?
<br>10	And Saul swore unto her by the Lord, say- ing: As the Lord liveth, there shall no evil hap- pen to thee for this thing.
<br>11	And the woman said to him: Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
<br>13	And the king said to her: Fear not: what hast thou seen? and the woman said to Saul: I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
<br>14	And he said to her: What form is he of? And she said: An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground, and adored.
<br>15	And Samuel said to Saul: Why hast thou disturbed my rest, that I should be brought up? And Saul said: I am in great distress: for the Philistines fight against me, and God is departed from me, and would not hear me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayst shew me what I shall do.
<br>16	And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the Lord has departed from thee, and is gone over to thy rival?
<br>17	For the Lord will do to thee as he spoke by me, and he will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	Because thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord, neither didst thou execute the wrath of his indignation upon Amalec. Therefore hath the Lord done to thee what thou sufferest this day.
<br>19	And the Lord also will deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines: and to morrow thou and thy sons shall be with me: and the Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
<br>20	And forthwith Saul fell all along on the ground; for he was frightened with the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day.
<br>21	And the woman came to Saul, (for he was very much troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I hearkened unto the words which thou spokest to me.
<br>22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, that thou mayst eat and recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.
<br>23	But he refused, and said: I will not eat. But his servants and the woman forced him, and at length hearkening to their voice, he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.
<br>24	Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she made haste and killed it: and taking meal, kneaded it, and baked some un- leavened bread,
<br>25	And set it before Saul, and before his ser- vants. And when they had eaten they rose up, and walked all that night.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 29
<br>Now all the troops of the Philistines were gath- ered together to Aphec: and Israel also en- camped by the fountain, which is in Jezrahel.
<br>2 And the lords of the Philistines marched with their hundreds and their thousands: but David and his men were in the rear with Achis. 3 And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the princes of the Philistines: Do you not know David who was the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me until this
<br>day?
<br>4	But the prices of the Philistines were angry with him, and they said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our heads?
<br>5	Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances, saying: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<br>6	Then Achis called David, and said to him: As the Lord liveth, thou art upright and good in my sight: and so is thy going out, and thy coming in with me in the army: and I have not found any evil in thee, since the day that thou camest to me unto this day: but thou pleasest not the lords.
<br>7	Return therefore, and go in peace, and of- fend not the eyes of the princes of the Philistines. 8 And David said to Achis: But what have I done, or what hast thou found in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in thy sight until this day, that I may not go and fight against the
<br>enemies of my lord the king?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And Achis answering, said to David: I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: But the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle.
<br>10	Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and it shall begin to be light, go on your way.
<br>11	So David and his men arose in the night, that they might set forward in the morning, and returned to the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrahel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>Now when David and his men were come to Sice- leg on the third day, the Amalecites had made an invasion on the south side upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with fire,
<br>2	And had taken the women captives that were in it, both little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had carried them with them, and went on their way.
<br>3	So when David and his men came to the city, and found it burnt with fire, and that their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives,
<br>4	David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voices, and wept till they had no more tears.
<br>5	For the two wives also of David were taken captives, Achinoam, the Jezrahelitess, and Abi- gail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
<br>6	And David was greatly afflicted: for the peo- ple had a mind to stone him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved for his sons and daugh- ters: but David took courage in the Lord his God.
<br>7	And he said to Abiathar, the priest, the son
<br> 
<br>of Achimelech: Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
<br>8	And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.
<br>9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some, being weary, stayed there.
<br>10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed, who, being weary, could not go over the torrent Besor.
<br>11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,
<br>12	As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them, his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water, three days and three nights.
<br>13	And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong; or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite: and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.
<br>14	For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.
<br>15	And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? and he said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to this company. And David swore to him. 16 And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread abroad upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and out of the land of Juda.
<br>17	And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next day, and there es- caped not a man of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.
<br>18	So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.
<br>19	And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken, David recovered all.
<br>20	And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before him: and they said: This is the prey of David.
<br>21	And David came to the two hundred men, who, being weary, had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people, saluted them peaceably.
<br>22	Then all the wicked and unjust men, that had gone with David, answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man take his wife, and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.
<br>23	But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands:
<br>24	And no man shall hearken to you in this matter.   But equal shall be the portion of him that went down to battle, and of him that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.
<br>25	And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made a statute and an ordinance, and as a law in Israel.
<br>26	Then David came to Siceleg,   and sent
<br> 
<br>presents of the prey to the ancients of Juda, his neighbours, saying: Receive a blessing of the prey of the enemies of the Lord.
<br>27	To them that were in Bethel, and that were in Ramoth to the south, and to them that were in Jether.
<br>28	And to them that were in Aroer, and that were in Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo, 29 And that were in Rachal, and that were in the cities of Jerameel, and that were in the cities
<br>of Ceni,
<br>30	And that were in Arama, and that were in the lake Asan, and that were in Athach,
<br>31	And that were in Hebron, and to the rest that were in those places, in which David had abode with his men.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>And the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gelboe.
<br>2	And the Philistines fell upon Saul, and upon his sons, and they slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchisua, the sons of Saul.
<br>3	And the whole weight of the battle was turned upon Saul: and the archers overtook him, and he was grievously wounded by the archers.
<br>4	Then Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and slay me, and mock at me. And his armourbearer would not: for he was struck with exceeding great fear. Then Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
<br>5	And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
<br>6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men that same day
<br> 
<br>
<br>together.
<br>7	And the men of Israel, that were beyond the valley, and beyond the Jordan, seeing that the Israelites were fled, and that Saul was dead, and his sons, forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt there.
<br>8	And on the morrow the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his three sons lying in mount Gelboe.
<br>9	And they cut off Saul’s head, and stripped him of his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the tem- ples of their idols and among their people.
<br>10	And they put his armour in the temple of Astaroth, but his body they hung on the wall of Bethsan.
<br>11	Now when the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad had heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
<br>12	All the most valiant men arose, and walked all the night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Bethsan: and they came to Jabes Galaad, and burnt them there.
<br>13	And they took their bones, and buried them in the wood of Jabes: and fasted seven days.

<br>Second Book of Samuel
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David returned from the slaughter of the Amale- cites, and abode two days in Siceleg.
<br>2	And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul’s camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head: and when he came to David, he fell upon his face, and adored.
<br>3	And David said to him: From whence comest thou? And he said to him: I am fled out of the camp of Israel.
<br>4	And David said unto him: What is the mat- ter that is come to pass? tell me: He said: The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people are fallen and dead: moreover Saul and Jonathan his son are slain.
<br>5	And David said to the young man that told him: How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?
<br>6	And the young man that told him, said: I came by chance upon mount Gelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear: and the chariots and horsemen drew nigh unto him,
<br>7	And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me.  And I answered, Here am I.
<br>8	And he said to me: Who art thou? And I said to him: I am an Amalecite.
<br>9	And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.
<br>10	So standing over him, I killed him: for I
<br> 
<br>
<br>knew that he could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to thee, my lord.
<br>11	Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him.
<br>12	And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword. 13 And David said to the young man that told him: Whence art thou? He answered: I am the
<br>son of a stranger of Amalec.
<br>14 David said to him: Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to kill the Lord’s anointed? 15 And David calling one of his servants, said:
<br>Go near and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died.
<br>16	And David said to him: Thy blood be upon thy own head: for thy own mouth hath spo- ken against thee, saying: I have slain the Lord’s anointed.
<br>17	And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son.
<br>18	(Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.) And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.
<br>19	The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains: how are the valiant fallen?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the un- circumcised triumph.
<br>21	Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come upon you, neither be they fields of firstfruits: for there was cast away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oil.
<br>22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not re- turn empty.
<br>23	Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, stronger than li- ons.
<br>24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with scarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your attire.
<br>25	How are the valiant fallen in battle? Jonathan slain in the high places?
<br>26	I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan: ex- ceeding beautiful, and amiable to me above the love of women. As the mother loveth her only son, so did I love thee.
<br>27	How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished?
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? And the Lord said to him: Go up. And David said: Whither shall I go up? And he an- swered him: Into Hebron.
<br>2 So David went up, and his two wives Achi- noam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:
<br> 
<br>3	And the men also that were with him, David brought up every man with his household: and they abode in the towns of Hebron.
<br>4	And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be king over the house of Juda. And it was told David that the men of Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.
<br>5	David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes Galaad, and said to them: Blessed be you to the Lord, who have shewn this mercy to your master Saul, and have buried him.
<br>6	And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth, and I also will requite you for this good turn, because you have done this thing. 7 Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour: for although your master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to
<br>be their king.
<br>8	But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul’s army, took Isboseth the son of Saul, and led him about through the camp,
<br>9	And made him king over Galaad, and over Gessuri, and over Jezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
<br>10	Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years; and only the house of Juda followed David.
<br>11	And the number of the days that David abode, reigning in Hebron over the house of Juda, was seven years and six months.
<br>12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth the son of Saul, went out from the camp to Gabaon.
<br>13	And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the ser- vants of David went out, and met them by the pool of Gabaon. And when they were come to- gether, they sat down over against one another: the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	And Abner said to Joab: Let the young men rise, and play before us. And Joab an- swered: Let them rise.
<br>15	Then there arose and went over twelve in number of Benjamin, of the part of Isboseth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 16 And every one catching his fellow by the head, thrust his sword into the side of his adver- sary, and they fell down together: and the name of the place was called: The field of the valiant,
<br>in Gabaon.
<br>17	And there was a very fierce battle that day: and Abner was put to flight, with the men of Israel, by the servants of David.
<br>18	And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and Abisai, and Asael: now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of the roes that abide in the woods.
<br>19	And Asael pursued after Abner, and turned not to the right hand nor to the left from follow- ing Abner.
<br>20	And Abner looked behind him, and said: Art thou Asael? And he answered: I am.
<br>21	And Abner said to him: Go to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils. But Asael would not leave off following him close.
<br>22	And again Abner said to Asael: Go off, and do not follow me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother.
<br>23	But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside: wherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot: and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still.
<br>24	Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over
<br> 
<br>against the valley by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon.
<br>25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together to Abner: and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a hill.
<br>26	And Abner cried out to Joab, and said: Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction? knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive people to despair? how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease from pursuing after their brethren?
<br>27	And Joab said: As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner, even in the morning the peo- ple should have retired from pursuing after their brethren.
<br>28	Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still, and did not pursue after Israel any farther, nor fight any more.
<br>29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plains: and they passed the Jordan, and having gone through all Beth-horon, came to the camp.
<br>30	And Joab returning, after he had left Ab- ner, assembled all the people: and there were wanting of David’s servants nineteen men, be- side Asael.
<br>31	But the servants of David had killed of Ben- jamin, and of the men that were with Abner, three hundred and sixty, who all died.
<br>32	And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father in Bethlehem and Joab, and the men that were with him, marched all the night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: David prospering and growing always stronger and stronger, but
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the house of Saul decaying daily.
<br>2	And sons were born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn was Ammon of Achinoam the Jezrahelitess:
<br>3	And his second Cheleab of Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel: and the third Absalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmai king of Gessur:
<br>4	And the fourth Adonias, the son of Haggith: and the fifth Saphathia the son of Abital:
<br>5	And the sixth Jethraam of Egla the wife of David: these were born to David In Hebron.
<br>6	Now while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner the son of Ner ruled the house of Saul.
<br>7	And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the daughter of Aia. And Isboseth said to Abner: 8 Why didst thou go in to my father’s con- cubine? And he was exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth, and said: Am I a dog’s head against Juda this day, who have shewn mercy to the house of Saul thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not delivered thee into the hands of David, and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concern-
<br>ing a woman?
<br>9 So do God to Abner, and more also, unless as the Lord hath sworn to David, so I do to him, 10 That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul, and the throne of David be set up over Israel, and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee. 11 And he could not answer him a word, be-
<br>cause he feared him.
<br>12	Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself, saying: Whose is the land? and that they should say: Make a league with me, and my hand shall be with thee: and I will bring all Israel to thee.
<br>13	And he said: Very well: I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee,
<br> 
<br>saying: Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul: and so thou shalt come, and see me.
<br>14	And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul, saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
<br>15	And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband Phaltiel, the son of Lais.
<br>16	And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim: and Abner said to him: Go and return. And he returned.
<br>17	Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel, saying: Both yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might reign over you.
<br>18	Now then do it: because the Lord hath spoken to David, saying: By the hand of my ser- vant David I will save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines, and of all their enemies. 19 And Abner spoke also to Benjamin. And he went to speak to David in Hebron all that
<br>seemed good to Israel, and to all Benjamin.
<br>20	And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men: and David made a feast for Abner, and his men that came with him.
<br>21	And Abner said to David: I will rise, that I may gather all Israel unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth. Now when David had brought Abner on his way, and he was gone in peace,
<br>22	Immediately, David’s servants and Joab came, after having slain the robbers, with an ex- ceeding great booty. And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had now sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
<br>23	And Joab and all the army that was with him, came afterwards: and it was told Joab, that Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	And Joab went in to the king, and said: What hast thou done? Behold Abner came to thee: Why didst thou send him away, and he is gone and departed?
<br>25	Knowest thou not Abner the son of Ner, that to this end he came to thee, that he might deceive thee, and to know thy going out, and thy coming in, and to know all thou dost?
<br>26	Then Joab going out from David, sent mes- sengers after Abner, and brought him back from the cistern of Sira, David knowing nothing of it. 27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate, to speak to him treacherously: and he stabbed him there in the groin, and he died, in revenge
<br>of the blood of Asael his brother.
<br>28	And when David heard of it, after the thing was now done, he said: I, and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
<br>29	And may it come upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house: and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed, or that is a leper, or that holdeth the distaff, or that falleth by the sword, or that wanteth bread.
<br>30	So Joab and Abisai his brother slew Ab- ner, because he had killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle.
<br>31	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloths, and mourn before the funeral of Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
<br>32	And when they had buried Abner in He- bron, king David lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner: and all the people also wept. 33 And the king mourning and lamenting over Abner, said: Not as cowards are wont to die,
<br>hath Abner died.
<br> 
<br>34	Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet laden with fetters: but as men fall before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.   And all the people repeating it wept over him.
<br>35	And when all the people came to take meat with David, while it was yet broad day, David swore, saying: So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or any thing else before sunset.
<br>36	And all the people heard, and they were pleased, and all that the king did seemed good in the sight of all the people.
<br>37	And all the people, and all Israel under- stood that day that it was not the king’s doing, that Abner the son of Ner was slain.
<br>38	The king also said to his servants: Do you not know that a prince and a great man is slain this day in Israel?
<br>39	But I as yet am tender, though anointed king. And these men the sons of Sarvia are too hard for me: the Lord reward him that doth evil according to his wickedness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron: and his hands were weak- ened, and all Israel was troubled.
<br>2	Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands, the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rem- mon a Berothite of the children of Benjamin: for Beroth also was reckoned in Benjamin.
<br>3	And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there until that time.
<br>4	And Jonathan the son of Saul had a son that was lame of his feet: for he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Jezrahel. And his nurse took him up and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>became lame: and his name was Miphiboseth.
<br>5	And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon. And the door- keeper of the house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.
<br>6	And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.
<br>7	For when they came into the house, he was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him and taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.
<br>8	And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron: and they said to the king: Be- hold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy who sought thy life: and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
<br>9	But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them: As the Lord liveth, who hath de- livered my soul out of all distress,
<br>10	The man that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought he brought good tidings, I ap- prehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.
<br>11	How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your hand, and take you away from the earth?
<br>12	And David commanded his servants and they slew them: and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying: Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.
<br>2	Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
<br>3	The ancients also of Israel came to the king of Hebron, and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel.
<br>4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
<br>5	In Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all Israel and Juda.
<br>6	And the king and all the men that were with him went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites the in- habitants of the land: and they said to David: Thou shalt not come in hither unless thou take away the blind and the lame that say: David shall not come in hither.
<br>7	But David took the castle of Sion, the same is the city of David.
<br>8	For David had offered that day a reward to whosoever should strike the Jebusites and get up to the gutters of the tops of the houses, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the soul of David: therefore it is said in the proverb: The blind and the lame shall not come into the temple.
<br>9	And David dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.
<br>10	And he went on prospering and growing up, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
<br>11	And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messen-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>gers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls: and they built a house for David.
<br>12	And David knew that the Lord had con- firmed him king over Israel, and that he had ex- alted his kingdom over his people Israel.
<br>13	And David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were born to David other sons also and daughters:
<br>14	And these are the names of them, that were born to him in Jerusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
<br>15	And Jebahar, and Elisua, and Nepheg,
<br>16	And Japhia, and Elisama, and Elioda, and Eliphaleth.
<br>17	And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David to be king over Israel: and they all came to seek David: and when David heard of it, he went down to a strong hold.
<br>18	And the Philistines coming spread them- selves in the valley of Raphaim.
<br>19	And David consulted the Lord, Saying: Shall I go up to the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to David: Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<br>20	And David came to Baal Pharisim: and de- feated them there, and he said, The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided. Therefore the name of the place was called Baal Pharisim.
<br>21	And they left there their idols: which David and his men took away.
<br>22	And the Philistines came up again and spread themselves into the valley of Raphaim.
<br>23	And David consulted the Lord: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? He answered: Go not up against them but fetch a compass behind them,
<br> 
<br>and thou shalt come upon them over against the pear trees.
<br>24	And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle: for then will the Lord go out before thy face to strike the army of the Philistines.
<br>25	And David did as the Lord had com- manded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gabaa until thou come to Gezer.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And David again gathered together all the cho- sen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
<br>2	And David arose and went, with all the peo- ple that were with him of the men of Juda to fetch the ark of God, upon which the name of the Lord of Hosts is invoked, who sitteth over it upon the cherubims.
<br>3	And they laid the ark of God upon a new cart: and took it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, and Oza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
<br>4	And when they had taken it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, Ahio having care of the ark of God went before the ark.
<br>5	But David and all Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of wood, on harps and lutes and timbrels and cornets and cymbals.
<br>6	And when they came to the floor of Na- chon, Oza put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it: because the oxen kicked and made it lean aside.
<br>7	And the indignation of the Lord was enkin- dled against Oza, and he struck him for his rash- ness: and he died there before the ark of God.
<br>8	And David was grieved because the Lord
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>had struck Oza, and the name of that place was called: The striking of Oza, to this day.
<br>9	And David was afraid of the Lord that day, saying: How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?
<br>10	And he would not have the ark of the Lord brought in to himself into the city of David: but he caused it to be carried into the house of Obe- dedom the Gethite.
<br>11	And the ark of the Lord abode in the house of Obededom the Gethite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household.
<br>12	And it was told king David, that the Lord had blessed Obededom, and all that he had, be- cause of the ark of God. So David went, and brought away the ark of God out of the house of Obededom into the city of David with joy. And there were with David seven choirs, and calves for victims.
<br>13	And when they that carried the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed and ox and a ram:
<br>14	And David danced with all his might before the Lord: and David was girded with a linen ephod.
<br>15	And David and all the louse of Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and with sound of trumpet.
<br>16	And when the ark of the Lord was come into the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul, looking out through a window, saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord: and she despised him in her heart.
<br>17	And they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it: and David of- fered holocausts, and peace offerings before the Lord.
<br>18	And when he had made an end of offering holocausts and peace offerings, he blessed the
<br> 
<br>people in the name of the Lord of hosts.
<br>19	And he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, both men and women, to every one, a cake of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and fine flour fried with oil: and all the people departed every one to his own house.
<br>20	And David returned to bless his own house: and Michol the daughter of Saul coming out to meet David, said: How glorious was the king of Israel to day, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be naked.
<br>21	And David said to Michol: Before the Lord, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, and commanded me to be ruler over the people of the Lord in Israel,
<br>22	I will both play and make myself meaner than I have done: and I will be little in my own eyes: and with the handmaids of whom thou speakest, I shall appear more glorious.
<br>23	Therefore Michol the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,
<br>2	He said to Nathan the prophet: Dost thou see that I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God is lodged within skins?
<br>3	And Nathan said to the king: Go, do all that is in they heart: because the Lord is with thee.
<br>4	But it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
<br>5	Go, and say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord: Shalt thou build me a house to dwell in?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	Whereas I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt even to this day: but have walked in a tabernacle, and in a tent.
<br>7	In all the places that I have gone through with all the children of Israel, did ever I speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
<br>8	And now thus shalt thou speak to my ser- vant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee out of the pastures from following the sheep to be ruler over my people Israel:
<br>9	And I have been with thee wheresoever thou hast walked, and have slain all thy enemies from before thy face: and I have made thee a great man, like unto the name of the great ones that are on the earth.
<br>10	And I will appoint a place for my people Is- rael, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell therein, and shall be disturbed no more: nei- ther shall the children of iniquity afflict them any more as they did before,
<br>11	From the day that I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thy enemies. And the Lord foretelleth to thee, that the Lord will make thee a house.
<br>12	And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of the bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
<br>13	He shall build a house to my name,  and I will establish the throne of his kingdom fore ever.
<br>14	I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and if he commit any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.
<br>15	But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed
<br> 
<br>from before my face.
<br>16	And thy house shall be faithful, and thy kingdom for ever before thy face, and thy throne shall be firm for ever.
<br>17	According to all these words and according to all this vision so did Nathan speak to David.
<br>18	And David went in, and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
<br>19	Bur yet this hath seemed little in thy sight, O Lord God, unless thou didst also speak of the house of thy servant for a long time to come: for this is the law of Adam, O Lord God:
<br>20	And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord God:
<br>21	For thy word’s sake, and according to thy own heart thou has done all these great things, so that thou wouldst make it known to thy servant. 22 Therefore thou art magnified, O Lord God, because there is none like to thee, neither is there any God besides thee, in all the things that we
<br>have heard with our ears.
<br>23	And what nation is there upon earth, as thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for them great and terrible things, upon the earth, before the face of thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thyself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods.
<br>24	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy peo- ple Israel to be an everlasting people: and thou, O Lord God, art become their God.
<br>25	And now, O Lord God, raise up for ever the word that thou hast spoken, concerning thy servant and concerning his house: and do as thou hast spoken,
<br>26	That thy name may be magnified for ever, and it may be said: The Lord of hosts is God over Israel. And the house of thy servant David
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall be established before the Lord.
<br>27	Because thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Is- rael, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, say- ing: I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
<br>28	And now, O Lord God, thou art God, and thy words shall be true: for thou hast spoken to thy servant these good things.
<br>29	And now begin, and bless the house of thy servant, that it may endure for ever before thee: because thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And it came to pass after this that David de- feated the Philistines, and brought them down, and David took the bridle of tribute out of the hand of the Philistines,
<br>2	And he defeated Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the earth: and he measured with two lines, one to put to death, and one to save alive: and Moab was made to serve David under tribute.
<br>3	David defeated also Adarezer the son of Ro- hob king of Soba, when he went to extend his dominion over the river Euphrates.
<br>4	And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and houghed all the chariot horses: and only reserved of them for one hundred chariots. 5 And the Syrians of Damascus came to suc- cour Adarezer the king of Soba: and David slew
<br>of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
<br>6 And David put garrisons in Syria of Damas- cus: and Syria served David under tribute, and the Lord preserved David in all his enterprises,
<br> 
<br>whithersoever he went.
<br>7	And David took the arms of gold, which the servants of Adarezer wore and brought them to Jerusalem.
<br>8	And out of Bete, and out of Beroth, cities of Adarezer, king David took and exceeding great quantity of brass.
<br>9	And Thou the king of Emath heard that David had defeated all the forces of Adarezer.
<br>10	And Thou sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to congratulate with him, and to return him thanks: because he had fought against Adarezer, and had defeated him. For Thou was an enemy to Adarezer, and in his hand were vessels of gold, and vessels of silver, and vessels of brass:
<br>11	And king David dedicated them to the Lord, together with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all the nations, which he had subdued:
<br>12	Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalec, and of the spoils of Adarezer the son of Rohob king of Soba.
<br>13	David also made himself a name, when he returned after taking Syria in the valley of the saltpits, killing eighteen thousand:
<br>14	And he put guards in Edom, and placed there a garrison: and all Edom was made to serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all enterprises he went about.
<br>15	And David reigned over all Israel: and David did judgment and justice to all his peo- ple.
<br>16	And Joab the son Sarvia was over the army: and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
<br>17	And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achim- elech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Saraias was the scribe:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the Cerethi and Phelethi: and the sons of David were the princes.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And David said: Is there any one, think you, left of the house of Saul, that I may shew kindness to him for Jonathan’s sake?
<br>2	Now there was of the house of Saul, a servant named Siba: and when the king had called him to him, he said to him: Art thou Siba? And he answered: I am Siba thy servant.
<br>3	And the king said: Is there any one left of the house of Saul,  that I may shew the mercy of God unto Him? And Siba said to the king: There is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his feet.
<br>4	Where is he? said he. And Siba said to the king: Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodabar.
<br>5	Then King David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel of Lod- abar.
<br>6	And when Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come to David, he fell on his face and worshipped. And David said: Miphi- boseth? And he answered: Behold thy servant.
<br>7	And David said to him: Fear not, for I will surely shew thee mercy for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and I will restore the lands of Saul the fa- ther, and thou shalt eat bread at my table al- ways.
<br>8	He bowed down to him, and said: Who am I thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I am?
<br>9	Then the King called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him: All that belonged to Saul, and all his house, I have given to thy master’s
<br> 
<br>son.
<br>10	Thou therefore and the sons and thy ser- vants shall till the land for him: and thou shalt bring in food for thy master’s son, that he may be maintained: and Miphiboseth the son of thy master shall always eat bread at my table. And Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
<br>11	And Siba said to the king: As thou my lord the hast commanded thy servant, so will thy servant do: and Miphiboseth shall eat at my table, as one of the sons of the King.
<br>12	And Miphiboseth had a young son whose name was Micha: and all that kindred of the house of Siba served Miphiboseth.
<br>13	But Miphiboseth dwelt in Jerusalem: be- cause he ate always of the king’s table: and he was lame of both feet.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>2	And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Daas, as his father shewed kindness to me. So David sent his servants to comfort him for the death of his father. But when the servants of David were come into the land of the children of Ammon,
<br>3	The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon their lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath sent comforters to thee, and hath not David rather sent his ser- vants to thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow it?
<br>4	Wherefore Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut away half of their garments even to the buttocks, and sent them away.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	When this was told David, he sent to meet them: for the men were sadly put to confusion, and David commanded them, saying: Stay at Jericho, till your beards be grown, and then re- turn.
<br>6	And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done an injury to David, sent and hired the Syrians of Rohob, and the Syrians of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha a thousand men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.
<br>7	And when David heard this, he sent Joab and the whole army of warriors.
<br>8	And the children of Ammon came out, and set their men in array at the entering in of the gate: but the Syrians of Soba, and of Rohob, and of Istob, and of Maacha were by themselves in the field.
<br>9	Then Joab seeing that the battle was pre- pared against him, both before and behind, chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
<br>10	And the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai his brother, who set them in array against the children of Ammon.
<br>11	And Joab said: If the Syrians are too strong for me,  then thou shalt help me,  but if the children of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
<br>12	Be of good courage, and let us fight for our people, and for the city of our God: and the Lord will do what is good in his sight.
<br>13	And Joab and the people that were with him, began to fight against the Syrians: and they immediately fled before him.
<br>14	And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they fled also before Abi- sai, and entered into the city: and Joab re- turned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>15	Then the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, gathered themselves to- gether.
<br>16	And Adarezer sent and fetched the Syrians, that were beyond the river, and brought over their army: and Sobach, the captain of the host of Adarezer, was their general.
<br>17	And when this was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam: and the Syrians set them- selves in array against David, and fought against him.
<br>18	And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen: and smote Sobach the captain of the army, who presently died.
<br>19	And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer, seeing themselves overcome by Israel, were afraid and fled away, eight and fifty thou- sand men before Israel. And they made peace with Israel: and served them, and all the Syri- ans were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth to war, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they spoiled the children of Am- mon, and besieged Rabba: but David remained in Jerusalem.
<br>2 In the mean time it happened that David arose from his bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: And he saw from the roof of his house a woman washing herself, over against him: and the woman was very beautiful. 3 And the king sent, and inquired who the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>woman was. And it was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urias the Hethite.
<br>4	And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him, and he slept with her: and presently she was purified from her unclean- ness:
<br>5	And she returned to her house having con- ceived. And she sent and told David, and said: I have conceived.
<br>6	And David sent to Joab, saying: Send me Urias the Hethite. And Joab sent Urias to David. 7 And Urias came to David. And David asked how Joab did, and the people, and how the war
<br>was carried on.
<br>8	And David said to Urias: Go into thy house, and wash thy feet. And Urias went out from the king’s house, and there went out after him a mess of meat from the king.
<br>9	But Urias slept before the gate of the king’s house, with the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.
<br>10	And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not to his house. And David said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?
<br>11	And Urias said to David: The ark of God and Israel and Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.
<br>12	Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and to morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.
<br>13	And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down
<br> 
<br>into his house.
<br>14	And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,
<br>15	Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.
<br>16	Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest men were.
<br>17	And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the Hethite was killed also.
<br>18	Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.
<br>19	And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the words of the bat- tle to the king,
<br>20	If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?
<br>21	Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant Urias the Hethite is also slain.
<br>22	So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had commanded him.
<br>23	And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.
<br>24	And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above: and some of the king’s servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.
<br>25	And David said to the messenger: Thus
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing dis- courage thee: for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against the city, and exhort them that thou mayest over- throw it.
<br>26	And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.
<br>27	And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And the Lord sent Nathan to David: and when he was come to him, he said to him: There were two men in one city, the one rich, and the other poor.
<br>2	The rich man had exceeding many sheep and oxen.
<br>3	But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom: and it was unto him as a daughter.
<br>4	And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger, who was come to him, but took the poor man’s ewe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. 5 And David’s anger being exceedingly kin- dled against that man, he said to Nathan: As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this is
<br>a child of death.
<br>6 He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this thing, and had no pity.
<br> 
<br>7	And Nathan said to David: Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul,
<br>8	And gave thee thy master’s house and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda: and if these things be little, I shall add far greater things unto thee.
<br>9	Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to do evil in my sight? Thou hast killed Urias the Hethite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
<br>10	Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the Hethite to be thy wife.
<br>11	Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes and give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
<br>12	For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and in the sight of the sun.
<br>13	And David said to Nathan: I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David: The Lord also hath taken away thy sin: thou shalt not die.
<br>14	Nevertheless, because thou hast given oc- casion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die.
<br>15	And Nathan returned to his house. The Lord also struck the child which the wife of Urias had borne to David, and his life was despaired of.
<br>16	And David besought the Lord for the child: and David kept a fast, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat meat with them.
<br>18	And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David feared to tell him, that the child was dead. For they said: Behold when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the child is dead?
<br>19	But when David saw his servants whisper- ing, he understood that the child was dead: and he said to his servants: Is the child dead? They answered him He is dead.
<br>20	Then David arose from the ground, and washed and anointed himself: and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the house of the Lord: and worshipped, and then he came into his own house, and he called for bread, and ate.
<br>21	And his servants said to him: What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread.
<br>22	And he said: While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept for him: for I said: Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give him to me, and the child may live?
<br>23	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him rather: but he shall not return to me.
<br>24	And David comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto her, and slept with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon, and the Lord loved him.
<br>25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name, Amiable to the Lord, because the Lord loved him.
<br> 
<br>26	And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and laid close siege to the royal city.
<br>27	And Joab sent messengers to David, say- ing: I have fought against Rabbath, and the city of waters is about to be taken.
<br>28	Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people together, and besiege the city and take it: lest when the city shall be wasted by me, the victory be ascribed to my name.
<br>29	Then David gathered all the people to- gether, and went out against Rabbath: and after fighting, he took it.
<br>30	And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold, set with most precious stones, and it was put upon David’s head, and the spoils of the city which were very great he carried away.
<br>31	And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and drove over them chariots armed with iron: and divided them with knives, and made them pass through brickkilns: so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon: and David returned, with all the army to Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And it came to pass after this that Ammon the son of David loved the sister of Absalom the son of David, who was very beautiful, and her name was Thamar.
<br>2	And he was exceedingly fond of her, so that he fell sick for the love of her: for as she was a virgin, he thought it hard to do any thing dis- honestly with her.
<br>3	Now Ammon had a friend, named Jonadab the son of Semmaa the brother of David, a very wise man:
<br>4	And he said to him: Why dost thou grow
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>so lean from day to day, O son of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of it? And Am- mon said to him: I am in love with Thamar the sister of my brother Absalom.
<br>5	And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.
<br>6	So Ammon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when the king came to visit him, Am- mon said to the king: I pray thee let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that I may eat at her hand.
<br>7	Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house of thy brother Ammon, and make him a mess.
<br>8	And Thamar came to the house of Ammon her brother: but he was laid down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it in his sight she made little messes.
<br>9	And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before him, but he would not eat: and Ammon said: Put out all persons from me. And when they had put all persons out,
<br>10	Ammon said to Thamar: Bring the mess into the chamber, that I may eat at thy hand. And Thamar took the little messes which she had made, and brought them in to her brother Ammon in the chamber.
<br>11	And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of her, and said: Come lie with me, my sister.
<br>12	She answered him: Do not so, my brother, do not force me: for no such thing must be done in Israel.  Do not thou this folly.
<br>13	For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel: but rather speak to the king, and he will not
<br> 
<br>deny me to thee.
<br>14	But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being stronger overpowered her and lay with her.
<br>15	Then Ammon hated her with an exceeding great hatred: so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her before. And Ammon said to her: Arise, and get thee gone.
<br>16	She answered him: The evil which now thou dost against me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst before. And he would not hearken to her:
<br>17	But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said: Thrust this woman out from me: and shut the door after her.
<br>18	And she was clothed with a long robe: for the king’s daughters that were virgins, used such kind of garments. Then his servant thrust her out: and shut the door after her.
<br>19	And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe and laid her hands upon her head, and went on crying.
<br>20	And Absalom her brother said to her: Hath thy brother Ammon lain with thee? but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy brother: and afflict not thy heart for this thing. So Thamar remained pining away in the house of Absalom her brother.
<br>21	And when king David heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved: and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Ammon, for he loved him, because he was his firstborn.
<br>22	But Absalom spoke not to Ammon neither good nor evil: for Absalom hated Ammon be- cause he had ravished his sister Thamar.
<br>23	And it came to pass after two years, that the sheep of Absalom were shorn in Baalhasor, which is near Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	And he came to the king, and said to him: Behold thy servant’s sheep are shorn. Let the king, I pray, with his servants come to his ser- vant.
<br>25	And the king said to Absalom: Nay, my son, do not ask that we should all come, and be chargeable to thee. And when he pressed him, and he would not go, he blessed him.
<br>26	And Absalom said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother Ammon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.
<br>27	But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Ammon and all the king’s sons go with him. And Absalom made a feast as it were the feast of a king.
<br>28	And Absalom had commanded his ser- vants, saying: Take notice when Ammon shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to you: Strike him, and kill him, fear not: for it is I that command you: take courage, and be valiant men.
<br>29	And the servants of Absalom did to Am- mon as Absalom had commanded them. And all the king’s sons arose and got up every man upon his mule, and fled.
<br>30	And while they were yet in the way, a ru- mour came to David, saying: Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one them left. 31 Then the king rose up, and rent his gar- ments: and fell upon the ground, and all his ser- vants, that stood about him, rent their garments. 32 But Jonadab the son of Semmaa David’s brother answering, said: Let not my lord the king think that all the king’s sons are slain: Am- mon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of Absalom from the day that he ravished
<br>his sister Thamar.
<br>33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take this thing into his heart, saying: All the king’s
<br> 
<br>sons are slain: for Ammon only is dead.
<br>34	But Absalom fled away: and the young man that kept the watch, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there came much people by a by-way on the side of the mountain.
<br>35	And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.
<br>36	And when he made an end of speaking, the king’s sons also appeared: and coming in they lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very much.
<br>37	But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai the son of Ammiud the king of Gessur. And David mourned for his son every day.
<br>38	And Absalom after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was there three years. And king David ceased to pursue after Absalom, because he was comforted concerning the death of Am- mon.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And Joab the son of Sarvia, understanding that the king’s heart was turned to Absalom,
<br>2	Sent to Thecua, and fetched from thence a wise woman: and said to her: Feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, and be not anointed with oil, that thou mayest be as a woman that had a long time been mourning for one dead.
<br>3	And thou shalt go in to the king, and shalt speak to him in this manner. And Joab put the words in her mouth.
<br>4	And when the woman of Thecua was come in to the king, she fell before him upon the ground, and worshipped, and said: Save me, O king.
<br>5	And the king said to her: What is the matter with thee? She answered: Alas, I am a widow
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>woman: for my husband is dead.
<br>6	And thy handmaid had two sons: and they quarrelled with each other in the field, and there was none to part them: and the one struck the other, and slew him.
<br>7	And behold the whole kindred rising against thy handmaid, saith: Deliver him that hath slain his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and that we may destroy the heir: and they seek to quench my spark which is left, and will leave my husband no name, nor remainder upon the earth.
<br>8	And the king said to the woman: Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
<br>9	And the woman of Thecua said to the king: Upon me, my lord be the iniquity, and upon the house of my father: but may the king and his throne be guiltless.
<br>10	And the king said: If any one shall say ought against thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
<br>11	And she said: Let the king remember the Lord his God, that the next of kin be not multi- plied to take revenge, and that they may not kill my son. And he said: As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
<br>12	The woman said: Let thy hand maid speak one word to my lord the king. And he said: Speak.
<br>13	And the woman said: Why hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God, and why hath the king spoken this word, to sin, and not bring home again his own exile?
<br>14	We all die, and like waters that return no more, we fall down into the earth: neither will God have a soul to perish, but recalleth, mean- ing that he that is cast off should not altogether perish.
<br>15	Now therefore I am come, to speak this word to my lord the king before the people. And
<br> 
<br>thy handmaid said: I will speak to the king, it maybe the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
<br>16	And the king hath hearkened to me to de- liver his handmaid out of the hand of all that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
<br>17	Then let thy handmaid say, that the word of the Lord the king be made as a sacrifice. For even as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, that he is neither moved with blessing nor curs- ing: wherefore the Lord thy God is also with thee.
<br>18	And the king answering, said to the woman: Hide not from me the thing that I ask thee. And the woman said to him: Speak, my lord the king.
<br>19	And the king said: Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? The woman answered, and said: By the health of thy soul, my lord, O king, it is neither on the left hand, nor on the right, in all these things which my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words into the mouth of thy handmaid.
<br>20	That I should come about with this form of speech, thy servant Joab commanded this: but thou, my lord, O king, art wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to understand all things upon earth.
<br>21	And the king said to Joab: Behold I am ap- peased and have granted thy request: Go there- fore and fetch back the boy Absalom.
<br>22	And Joab falling down to the ground upon his face, adored, and blessed the king: and Joab said: This day thy servant hath understood, that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king: for thou hast fulfilled the request of thy servant. 23 Then Joab arose and went to Gessur, and
<br>brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	But the king said: Let him return into his house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned into his house, and saw not the king’s face.
<br>25	But in all Israel there was not a man so comely, and so exceedingly beautiful as Absalom: from the sole of the foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
<br>26	And when he polled his hair (now he was polled once a year, because his hair was burden- some to him) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred sicles, according to the common weight.
<br>27	And there were born to Absalom three sons: and one daughter, whose name was Thamar, and she was very beautiful.
<br>28	And Absalom dwelt two years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.
<br>29	He sent therefore to Joab, to send him to the king: but he would not come to him. And when he had sent the second time, and he would not come to him,
<br>30	He said to his servants: You know the field of Joab near my field, that hath a crop of barley: go now and set it on fire. So the servants of Ab- salom set the corn on fire. And Joab’s servants coming with their garments rent, said: The ser- vants of Absalom have set part of the field on fire.
<br>31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said: Why have thy servants set my corn on fire?
<br>32	And Absalom answered Joab: I sent to thee beseeching thee to come to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him: Wherefore am I come from Gessur? it had been better for me to be there: I beseech thee therefore that I may see the face of the king: and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill me.
<br>33	So Joab going in to the king, told him all:
<br> 
<br>and Absalom was called for, and, he went in to the king: and prostrated himself on the ground before him: and the king kissed Absalom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>Now after these things Absalom made himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run be- fore him.
<br>2	And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any man had business to come to the king’s judgment, Absa- lom called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou?   He answered, and said: Thy servant is of such tribe of Israel.
<br>3	And Absalom answered him: Thy words seem to me good and just. But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee. And Absa- lom said:
<br>4	O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business might come to me, that I might do them justice.
<br>5	Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
<br>6	And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to be heard by the king, and he en- ticed the hearts of the men of Israel.
<br>7	And after forty years, Absalom said to king David: Let me go, and pay my vows which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.
<br>8	For thy servant made a vow, when he was in Gessur of Syria, saying: If the Lord shall bring me again into Jerusalem, I will offer sacrifice to the Lord.
<br>9	And king David said to him: Go in peace.
<br>And he arose, and went to Hebron.
<br>10	And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel, saying: As soon as you shall hear the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sound of the trumpet, say ye: Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
<br>11	Now there went with Absalom two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and knowing nothing of the design.
<br>12	Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city Gilo. And while he was offering sacrifices, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running to- gether increased with Absalom.
<br>13	And there came a messenger to David, say- ing: All Israel with their whole heart followeth Absalom.
<br>14	And David said to his servants, that were with him in Jerusalem: Arise and let us flee: for we shall not escape else from the face of Absa- lom: make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
<br>15	And the king’s servants said to him: What- soever our lord the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.
<br>16	And the king went forth, and all his house- hold on foot: and the king left ten women his concubines to keep the house:
<br>17	And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood afar off from the house:
<br>18	And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors, six hundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the king.
<br>19	And the king said to Ethai the Gethite: Why comest thou with us: return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come out of thy own place.
<br>20	Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go forth with us? but I shall go whither I am going: return thou, and take
<br> 
<br>back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee mercy, and truth, because thou hast shewn grace and fidelity.
<br>21	And Ethai answered the king, saying: As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth: in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.
<br>22	And David said to Ethai: Come, and pass over. And Ethai the Gethite passed, and all the men that were with him, and the rest of the peo- ple.
<br>23	And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself went over the brook Cedron, and all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the desert.
<br>24	And Sadoc the priest also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God: and Abiathar went up, till all the people that was come out of the city had done passing.
<br>25	And the king said to Sadoc: Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he will bring me again, and he will shew me it, and his tabernacle.
<br>26	But if he shall say to me: Thou pleasest me not: I am ready, let him do that which is good before him.
<br>27	And the king said to Sadoc the priest: O seer, return into the city in peace: and let Achi- maas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, be with you.
<br>28	Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the wilderness, till there come word from you to cer- tify me.
<br>29	So Sadoc and Abiathar carried back the ark of God into Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
<br>30	But David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, going up and weeping, walking barefoot,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and with his head covered, and all the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered weeping.
<br>31	And it was told David that Achitophel also was in the conspiracy with Absalom, and David said: Infatuate, O Lord, I beseech thee, the coun- sel of Achitophel.
<br>32	And when David was come to the top of the mountain, where he was about to adore the Lord, behold Chusai the Arachite, came to meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with earth.
<br>33	And David said to him: If thou come with me, thou wilt be a burden to me:
<br>34	But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to Absalom: I am thy servant, O king: as I have been thy father’s servant, so I will be thy servant: thou shalt defeat the counsel of Achitophel.
<br>35	And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and so- ever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.
<br>36	And there are with them their two sons Achimaas; the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar: and you shall send by them to me every thing that you shall hear.
<br>37	Then Chusai the friend of David went into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.
<br>2	And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king’s household to sit on: and the loaves
<br> 
<br>and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.
<br>3	And the king said: Where is thy master’s son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day, will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
<br>4	And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.
<br>5	And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,
<br>6	And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.
<br>7	And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.
<br>8	The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, be- cause thou art a man of blood.
<br>9	And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.
<br>10	And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?
<br>11	And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>as the Lord hath bidden him.
<br>12	Perhaps the Lord may look upon my afflic- tion, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.
<br>13	And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill’s side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.
<br>14	And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
<br>15	But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.
<br>16	And when Chusai the Arachite, David’s friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.
<br>17	And Absalom said to him, Is this thy kind- ness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?
<br>18	And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.
<br>19	Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king’s son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.
<br>20	And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.
<br>21	And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.
<br>22	So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father’s concubines before all Israel.
<br>23	Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And Achitophel said to Absalom: I will choose me twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.
<br>2	And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak handed) I will defeat him: and when all the people is put to flight that is with him, I will kill the king who will be left alone.
<br>3	And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but one man: for thou seekest but one man: and all the people shall be in peace.
<br>4	And his saying pleased Absalom, and all the ancients of Israel.
<br>5	But Absalom said: Call Chusai the Arachite, and let us hear what he also saith.
<br>6	And when Chusai was come to Absalom, Absalom said to him: Achitophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do it or not? what counsel dost thou give?
<br>7	And Chusai said to Absalom: The counsel that Achitophel hath given this time is not good. 8 And again Chusai said: Thou knowest thy father, and the men that are with him, that they are very valiant, and bitter in their mind, as a bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken away: and thy father is a warrior, and will
<br>not lodge with the people.
<br>9	Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he liest: and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that followed Absalom.
<br>10	And the most valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall melt for fear: for all the people of Israel know thy father to be a valiant man, and that all who are with him are valiant.
<br>11	But this seemeth to me to be good counsel: Let all Israel be gathered to thee, from Dan to
<br> 
<br>

<br>Bersabee, as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered: and thou shalt be in the midst of them.
<br>12	And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be found: and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the ground, and we shall not leave of the men that are with him, not so much as one.
<br>13	And if he shall enter into any city, all Israel shall cast ropes round about that city, and we will draw it into the river, so that there shall not be found so much as one small stone thereof.
<br>14	And Absalom, and all the men of Israel said: The counsel of Chusai the Arachite is bet- ter than the counsel of Achitophel: and by the will of the Lord the profitable counsel of Achi- tophel was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.
<br>15	And Chusai said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests: Thus and thus did Achitophel counsel Absalom, and the ancients of Israel: and thus and thus did I counsel them.
<br>16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Tarry not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but without delay pass over: lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that is with him.
<br>17	And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel: and there went a maid and told them: and they went forward, to carry the mes- sage to king David, for they might not be seen, nor enter into the city.
<br>18	But a certain boy saw them, and told Absa- lom: but they making haste went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.
<br>19	And a woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the well, as it were to dry sodden barley and so the thing was not known. 20 And when Absalom’s servants were come
<br> 
<br>into the house, they said to the woman: Where is Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman an- swered them: They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a little water. But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into Jerusalem.
<br>21	And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you.
<br>22	So David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan, until it grew light, and not one of them was left that was not gone ever the river.
<br>23	But Achitophel seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled his ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his city, and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
<br>24	But David came to the camp, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
<br>25	Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab’s stead over the army: and Amasa was the son of a man who was called Jethra, of Jezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of Sarvia who was the mother of Joab.
<br>26	And Israel camped with Absalom in the land of Galaad.
<br>27	And when David was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammihel of Lodabar and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,
<br>28	Brought him beds, and tapestry, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and fried pulse,
<br>29	And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave to David and the people
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that were with him, to eat: for they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the wilderness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And David, having reviewed his people, ap- pointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,
<br>2	And sent forth a third part of the people un- der the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.
<br>3	And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.
<br>4	And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.
<br>5	And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.
<br>6	So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
<br>7	And the people of Israel were defeated there by David’s army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.
<br>8	And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest consumed, than whom the sword devoured that day.
<br> 
<br>9	And it happened that Absalom met the ser- vants of David, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.
<br>10	And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.
<br>11	And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and a belt?
<br>12	And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of sil- ver, I would not lay my hands upon the king’s son for in our hearing the king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Ab- salom.
<br>13	Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?
<br>14	And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but I will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,
<br>15	Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.
<br>16	And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude. 17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into
<br>a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceed- ing great heap of stones upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.
<br>18	Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king’s valley: for he said: I have no son, and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>by his own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day.
<br>19	And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies. 20 And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear
<br>tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
<br>21	And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.
<br>22	Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chu- sai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.
<br>23	He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.
<br>24	And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.
<br>25	And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,
<br>26	The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see an- other man running alone. And the king said: He also is a good messenger.
<br>27	And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news. 28 And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up
<br> 
<br>the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.
<br>29	And the king said: Is the young man Ab- salom safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.
<br>30	And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.
<br>31	And when he had passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.
<br>32	And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.
<br>33	The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son: would to God that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for his son:
<br>2	And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day: The king grieveth for his son.
<br>3	And the people shunned the going into the city that day as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away from the bat- tle.
<br>4	And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, O Absa-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>lom my son, O my son.
<br>5	Then Joab going into the house to the king, said: Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants,  that have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines. 6 Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee: and thou hast shewn this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, nor for thy servants: and I now plainly perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had been slain,
<br>then it would have pleased thee.
<br>7	Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants: for I swear to thee by the Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the evils that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.
<br>8	Then the king arose and sat in the gate: and it was told to all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the people came before the king, but Israel fled to their own dwellings.
<br>9	And all the people were at strife in all the tribes of Israel, saying: The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines: and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
<br>10	But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the king?
<br>11	And king David sent to Sadoc, and Abi- athar the priests, saying: Speak to the ancients of Juda, saying: Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? (For the talk of all Israel was come to the king in his house.)
<br>12	You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you the last to bring back the king?
<br>13	And say ye to Amasa:  Art not thou my
<br> 
<br>bone, and my flesh? So do God to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of the army before me always in the place of Joab.
<br>14	And he inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying: Return thou, and all thy servants. 15 And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the Jordan. 16 And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jem- ini of Bahurim, made haste and went down with
<br>the men of Juda to meet king David,
