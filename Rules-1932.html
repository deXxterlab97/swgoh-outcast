<br>In subsections (a) and (b), the words "and title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)" are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words "this Act", meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under section 111 of this title. Reference to title V of this Act is omitted as obsolete because of the Act of October 22, 1968 (Public Law 90–620, 82 Stat. 1238), the first section of which enacted Title 44, United States Code. The responsibilities of the Administrator of General Services under title V were given to the Archivist of the United States, National Historical Publications and Records Commission, and Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "subject to chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5" are substituted for "subject to the civil-service and classification laws" because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89–554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.

<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "section 973 of title 10" are substituted for "section 1222 of the Revised Statutes (10 U. S. C. 576)" in section 208(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 49(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640), the first section of which enacted Title 10, United States Code, and section 4(a)(5) and (6) of the Act of January 2, 1968 (Public Law 90–235, 81 Stat. 759). The words "personnel (including armed services personnel) from an executive agency other than the General Services Administration" are substituted for "officials, officers, and other personnel in other executive agencies, including personnel of the armed services" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "On and after June 23, 1913" are omitted as obsolete. The word "Administrator" is substituted for "Secretary of the Treasury" [subsequently changed to "Federal Works Administrator" because of section 301 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426)], and the word "Administration" [meaning the General Services Administration] is substituted for "public-buildings service" and "Office of the Supervising Architect" [subsequently changed to "Public Buildings Administration" because of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1427)], because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words "Department of Defense" are substituted for "National Military Establishment" in section 206(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the Department of Defense is deemed to succeed the National Military Establishment under section 12(a) and (g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (ch. 412, 63 Stat. 591).

<br>In subsection (c), the words "Comptroller General" are substituted for "General Accounting Office" because of 31:702 and for consistency in the revised title.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "Director of the Office of Management and Budget" are substituted for "Director of the Bureau of the Budget" in section 202(a)(1) (last sentence) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the reference to "section 204(b)" in section 202(a)(1) (last sentence) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is translated as a reference to section 204(c) of the Act because subsection (b) was redesignated as (c) by the Act of August 31, 1954 (ch.1178, 68 Stat. 1051).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2)(A), the words "chapter 91 of title 31" are substituted for "the Government Corporation Control Act (59 Stat. 597, 31 U.S.C. 841)" in section 202(a)(1) (last sentence) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1067), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the word "at" is substituted for "as" (in the phrase "as [sic] prices set by the Administrator") to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See Senate Report No. 2075, dated July 2, 1952 (United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, 82nd Congress, 2d Session, 1952, Volume 2, p. 2123).
