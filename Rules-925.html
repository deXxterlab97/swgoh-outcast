<br>
<br>No Federal agency may engage in any standards-related activity that creates unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States, including, but not limited to, standards-related activities that violate any of the following requirements:
<br>(1) Nondiscriminatory treatment
<br>
<br>Each Federal agency shall ensure, in applying standards-related activities with respect to any imported product, that such product is treated no less favorably than are like domestic or imported products, including, but not limited to, when applying tests or test methods, no less favorable treatment with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) the acceptance of the product for testing in comparable situations;
<br>
<br>(B) the administration of the tests in comparable situations;
<br>
<br>(C) the fees charged for tests;
<br>
<br>(D) the release of test results to the exporter, importer, or agents;
<br>
<br>(E) the siting of testing facilities and the selection of samples for testing; and
<br>
<br>(F) the treatment of confidential information pertaining to the product.
<br>(2) Use of international standards
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each Federal agency, in developing standards, shall take into consideration international standards and shall, if appropriate, base the standards on international standards.
<br>(B) Application of requirement
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the following apply:
<br>(i) International standards not appropriate
<br>
<br>The reasons for which the basing of a standard on an international standard may not be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:
<br>
<br>(I) National security requirements.
<br>
<br>(II) The prevention of deceptive practices.
<br>

<br>(3) Performance criteria
<br>
<br>Each Federal agency shall, if appropriate, develop standards based on performance criteria, such as those relating to the intended use of a product and the level of performance that the product must achieve under defined conditions, rather than on design criteria, such as those relating to the physical form of the product or the types of material of which the product is made.
<br>(4) Access for foreign suppliers
<br>
<br>Each Federal agency shall, with respect to any conformity assessment procedure used by it, permit access for obtaining an assessment of conformity and the mark of the system, if any, to foreign suppliers of a product on the same basis as access is permitted to suppliers of like products, whether of domestic or other foreign origin.

<br>(a) Oversight and consultation

<br>(1) inform, and consult and coordinate with, the Trade Representative with respect to international standards-related activities identified under paragraph (2);
<br>
<br>(2) keep adequately informed regarding international standards-related activities and identify those that may substantially affect the commerce of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(3) carry out such functions as are required under subsections (b) and (c).
<br>(b) Representation of United States interests by private persons
<br>(1) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—

<br>
<br>The term "organization member" means the private person who holds membership in a private international standards organization.
<br>(B) Private international standards organization
<br>
<br>The term "private international standards organization" means any international standards organization before which the interests of the United States are represented by a private person who is officially recognized by that organization for such purpose.
<br>(2) In general
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, the representation of United States interests before any private international standards organization shall be carried out by the organization member.
<br>(3) Inadequate representation
<br>
<br>If the Secretary concerned, after inquiry instituted on his own motion or at the request of any private person, Federal agency, or State agency having an interest therein, has reason to believe that the participation by the organization member in the proceedings of a private international standards organization will not result in the adequate representation of United States interests that are, or may be, affected by the activities of such organization (particularly with regard to the potential impact of any such activity on the international trade of the United States), the Secretary concerned shall immediately notify the organization member concerned. During any such inquiry, the Secretary concerned may solicit and consider the advice of the appropriate representatives referred to in section 2547 of this title.
<br>(4) Action by organization member
<br>
<br>If within the 90-day period after the date on which notification is received under paragraph (3) (or such shorter period as the Secretary concerned determines to be necessary in extraordinary circumstances), the organization member demonstrates to the Secretary concerned its willingness and ability to represent adequately United States interests before the private international standards organization, the Secretary concerned shall take no further action under this subsection.
<br>(5) Action by Secretary concerned
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) within the appropriate period referred to in paragraph (4), the organization member does not respond to the Secretary concerned with respect to the notification, or does respond but does not demonstrate to the Secretary concerned the requisite willingness and ability to represent adequately United States interests; or

<br>(B) there is no organization member of the private international standards organization;
<br>
<br>the Secretary concerned shall make appropriate arrangements to provide for the adequate representation of United States interests. In cases where subparagraph (A) applies, such provision shall be made by the Secretary concerned through the appropriate organization member if the private international standards organization involved requires representation by that member.

<br>
<br>(1) encourage cooperation among interested Federal agencies with a view toward facilitating the development of a uniform position with respect to the technical activities with which the organization is concerned;
<br>
<br>(2) encourage such Federal agencies to seek information from, and to cooperate with, the affected domestic interests when undertaking such representation; and
