<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–260, §2, Aug. 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 711, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the tribal right of self-government flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;
<br>
<br>"(2) the United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes, including the right of the Indian tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(3) although progress has been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;
<br>
<br>"(4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project, established under title III of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ([Pub. L. 93–638, former] 25 U.S.C. 450f note) was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program management;
<br>
<br>"(5) although the Federal Government has made considerable strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other laws; and
<br>
<br>"(6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring full control and funding to tribal governments, upon tribal request, over decision making for Federal programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof)—
<br>
<br>"(A) is an appropriate and effective means of implementing the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian tribes; and
<br>
<br>"(B) strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination."
<br>Declaration of Policy
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–260, §3, Aug. 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 712, provided that: "It is the policy of Congress—
<br>
<br>"(1) to permanently establish and implement tribal self-governance within the Department of Health and Human Services;
<br>
<br>"(2) to call for full cooperation from the Department of Health and Human Services and its constituent agencies in the implementation of tribal self-governance—
<br>
<br>"(A) to enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(B) to permit each Indian tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] relating to the provision of Federal services to Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(C) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;
<br>
<br>"(D) to affirm and enable the United States to fulfill its obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other laws;
<br>
<br>"(E) to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes through direct and meaningful consultation with all tribes;
<br>
<br>"(F) to permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian tribes with meaningful authority, control, funding, and discretion to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) that meet the needs of the individual tribal communities;
<br>
<br>"(G) to provide for a measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy as programs, services, functions, and activities (or portion thereof) are assumed by Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(H) to encourage the Secretary to identify all programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) of the Department of Health and Human Services that may be managed by an Indian tribe under this Act [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 5301 of this title] and to assist Indian tribes in assuming responsibility for such programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof); and
<br>
<br>"(I) to provide Indian tribes with the earliest opportunity to administer programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) from throughout the Department of Health and Human Services."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be followed by "or".
<br>§5382. Establishment
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish and carry out a program within the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services to be known as the "Tribal Self-Governance Program" in accordance with this subchapter.

<br>(a) Mandatory provisions
<br>(1) Health status reports
<br>
<br>Compacts or funding agreements negotiated between the Secretary and an Indian tribe shall include a provision that requires the Indian tribe to report on health status and service delivery—
<br>
<br>(A) to the extent such data is not otherwise available to the Secretary and specific funds for this purpose are provided by the Secretary under the funding agreement; and
<br>
<br>(B) if such reporting shall impose minimal burdens on the participating Indian tribe and such requirements are promulgated under section 5397 of this title.
<br>(2) Reassumption
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Compacts or funding agreements negotiated between the Secretary and an Indian tribe shall include a provision authorizing the Secretary to reassume operation of a program, service, function, or activity (or portions thereof) and associated funding if there is a specific finding relative to that program, service, function, or activity (or portion thereof) of—
<br>
<br>(i) imminent endangerment of the public health caused by an act or omission of the Indian tribe, and the imminent endangerment arises out of a failure to carry out the compact or funding agreement; or
<br>
<br>(ii) gross mismanagement with respect to funds transferred to a tribe by a compact or funding agreement, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Inspector General, as appropriate.
<br>(B) Prohibition
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not reassume operation of a program, service, function, or activity (or portions thereof) unless—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary has first provided written notice and a hearing on the record to the Indian tribe; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Indian tribe has not taken corrective action to remedy the imminent endangerment to public health or gross mismanagement.
<br>(C) Exception
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the Secretary may, upon written notification to the Indian tribe, immediately reassume operation of a program, service, function, or activity (or portion thereof) if—
<br>
<br>(I) the Secretary makes a finding of imminent substantial and irreparable endangerment of the public health caused by an act or omission of the Indian tribe; and
<br>
<br>(II) the endangerment arises out of a failure to carry out the compact or funding agreement.
<br>(ii) Reassumption
<br>
<br>If the Secretary reassumes operation of a program, service, function, or activity (or portion thereof) under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide the Indian tribe with a hearing on the record not later than 10 days after such reassumption.
<br>(D) Hearings
<br>
<br>In any hearing or appeal involving a decision to reassume operation of a program, service, function, or activity (or portion thereof), the Secretary shall have the burden of proof of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence the validity of the grounds for the reassumption.
<br>(b) Final offer
<br>
<br>In the event the Secretary and a participating Indian tribe are unable to agree, in whole or in part, on the terms of a compact or funding agreement (including funding levels), the Indian tribe may submit a final offer to the Secretary. Not more than 45 days after such submission, or within a longer time agreed upon by the Indian tribe, the Secretary shall review and make a determination with respect to such offer. In the absence of a timely rejection of the offer, in whole or in part, made in compliance with subsection (c) of this section, the offer shall be deemed agreed to by the Secretary.
<br>(c) Rejection of final offers
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Secretary rejects an offer made under subsection (b) of this section (or one or more provisions or funding levels in such offer), the Secretary shall provide—
<br>
<br>(A) a timely written notification to the Indian tribe that contains a specific finding that clearly demonstrates, or that is supported by a controlling legal authority, that—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of funds proposed in the final offer exceeds the applicable funding level to which the Indian tribe is entitled under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(ii) the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) that is the subject of the final offer is an inherent Federal function that cannot legally be delegated to an Indian tribe;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Indian tribe cannot carry out the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) in a manner that would not result in significant danger or risk to the public health; or
<br>
<br>(iv) the Indian tribe is not eligible to participate in self-governance under section 5383 of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) technical assistance to overcome the objections stated in the notification required by subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(C) the Indian tribe with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, except that the Indian tribe may, in lieu of filing such appeal, directly proceed to initiate an action in a Federal district court pursuant to section 5331(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(D) the Indian tribe with the option of entering into the severable portions of a final proposed compact or funding agreement, or provision thereof, (including a lesser funding amount, if any), that the Secretary did not reject, subject to any additional alterations necessary to conform the compact or funding agreement to the severed provisions.
<br>(2) Effect of exercising certain option
<br>
<br>If an Indian tribe exercises the option specified in paragraph (1)(D), that Indian tribe shall retain the right to appeal the Secretary's rejection under this section, and subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of that paragraph shall only apply to that portion of the proposed final compact, funding agreement, or provision thereof that was rejected by the Secretary.
<br>(d) Burden of proof
<br>
<br>With respect to any hearing or appeal or civil action conducted pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence the validity of the grounds for rejecting the offer (or a provision thereof) made under subsection (b) of this section.
<br>(e) Good faith
<br>
<br>In the negotiation of compacts and funding agreements the Secretary shall at all times negotiate in good faith to maximize implementation of the self-governance policy. The Secretary shall carry out this subchapter in a manner that maximizes the policy of tribal self-governance, in a manner consistent with the purposes specified in section 3 of the Tribal Self-Governance Amendments of 2000.
<br>(f) Savings
<br>
<br>To the extent that programs, functions, services, or activities (or portions thereof) carried out by Indian tribes under this subchapter reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of tribal shares and other funds determined under section 5388(c) of this title, the Secretary shall make such savings available to the Indian tribes, inter-tribal consortia, or tribal organizations for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries in a manner equitable to directly served, contracted, and compacted programs.
<br>(g) Trust responsibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary is prohibited from waiving, modifying, or diminishing in any way the trust responsibility of the United States with respect to Indian tribes and individual Indians that exists under treaties, Executive orders, other laws, or court decisions.
<br>(h) Decisionmaker
<br>
<br>A decision that constitutes final agency action and relates to an appeal within the Department of Health and Human Services conducted under subsection (c) of this section shall be made either—
<br>
<br>(1) by an official of the Department who holds a position at a higher organizational level within the Department than the level of the departmental agency in which the decision that is the subject of the appeal was made; or
<br>
<br>(2) by an administrative judge.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary is expressly prohibited from—

<br>
<br>(III) a tribal authorization;
<br>

<br>(e) Other resources
<br>
<br>In the event an Indian tribe elects to carry out a compact or funding agreement with the use of Federal personnel, Federal supplies (including supplies available from Federal warehouse facilities), Federal supply sources (including lodging, airline transportation, and other means of transportation including the use of interagency motor pool vehicles) or other Federal resources (including supplies, services, and resources available to the Secretary under any procurement contracts in which the Department is eligible to participate), the Secretary shall acquire and transfer such personnel, supplies, or resources to the Indian tribe.
<br>(f) Reimbursement to Indian Health Service
<br>
<br>With respect to functions transferred by the Indian Health Service to an Indian tribe, the Indian Health Service shall provide goods and services to the Indian tribe, on a reimbursable basis, including payment in advance with subsequent adjustment. The reimbursements received from those goods and services, along with the funds received from the Indian tribe pursuant to this subchapter, may be credited to the same or subsequent appropriation account which provided the funding, such amounts to remain available until expended.
<br>(g) Prompt Payment Act
<br>
<br>Chapter 39 of title 31 shall apply to the transfer of funds due under a compact or funding agreement authorized under this subchapter.

Funds transferred under this subchapter shall be managed using the prudent investment standard.
<br>(i) Carryover of funds
<br>
<br>All funds paid to an Indian tribe in accordance with a compact or funding agreement shall remain available until expended.

<br>(j) Program income
<br>
<br>All Medicare, Medicaid, or other program income earned by an Indian tribe shall be treated as supplemental funding to that negotiated in the funding agreement. The Indian tribe may retain all such income and expend such funds in the current year or in future years except to the extent that the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) provides otherwise for Medicare and Medicaid receipts. Such funds shall not result in any offset or reduction in the amount of funds the Indian tribe is authorized to receive under its funding agreement in the year the program income is received or for any subsequent fiscal year.
<br>(k) Limitation of costs
<br>
<br>An Indian tribe shall not be obligated to continue performance that requires an expenditure of funds in excess of the amount of funds transferred under a compact or funding agreement. If at any time the Indian tribe has reason to believe that the total amount provided for a specific activity in the compact or funding agreement is insufficient the Indian tribe shall provide reasonable notice of such insufficiency to the Secretary. If the Secretary does not increase the amount of funds transferred under the funding agreement, the Indian tribe may suspend performance of the activity until such time as additional funds are transferred.
