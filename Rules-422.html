<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>Section is derived from subsec. (e) of former section 264 of this title. See Codification note set out under section 1811 of this title.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2006—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 109–351, §608(b)(1), inserted "and section 1464(i)(5) of this title" after "section 1815(d) of this title" in introductory provisions.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 109–351, §608(b)(2), which directed insertion of "or Federal" after "insured State,", was executed by making the insertion after "insured State", to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
<br>
<br>1992—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 102–550 amended directory language of Pub. L. 102–242, §115(b). See 1991 Amendment note below.
<br>
<br>1991—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 102–242, §115(b), as amended by Pub. L. 102–550, §1603(b)(6), amended subsec. (b) generally, substituting present provisions for provisions which related to certification by other banking agencies.
<br>
<br>1989—Pub. L. 101–73, §201(a), substituted references to insured depository institutions for references to insured banks wherever appearing.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 101–73, §205(1), inserted heading, designated existing provisions as par. (1), inserted par. (1) heading, and substituted "Each bank" for "Every bank", and added par. (2).
<br>
<br>Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101–73, §205(2)(A), (B), inserted after first sentence "Any application or notice for membership or to commence or resume business shall be promptly provided by the appropriate Federal banking agency to the Corporation and the Corporation shall have a reasonable period of time to provide comments on such application or notice. Any comments submitted by the Corporation to the appropriate Federal banking agency shall be considered by such agency." and struck out at end "A State bank, resulting from the conversion of an insured national bank, shall continue as an insured bank. A State bank, resulting from the merger or consolidation of insured banks, or from the merger or consolidation of a noninsured bank or institution with an insured State bank, shall continue as an insured bank."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–73, §205(2)(C), which directed the amendment of subsec. (b) by substituting "(b) Certification by Other Banking Agencies.—Every national bank" for "(b) Every national bank" could not be executed literally because the original read "(b) Every national member bank", but was executed by inserting the heading without changing the text to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 101–73, §205(3), amended subsec. (c) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (c) read as follows: "Every Federal savings bank which is chartered pursuant to section 1464(o) of this title, and which is engaged in the business of receiving deposits other than trust funds, shall be an insured bank from the time it is authorized to commence business, until such time as its accounts are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation."

<br>§1815. Deposit insurance
<br>(a) Application to Corporation required
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), any depository institution which is engaged in the business of receiving deposits other than trust funds (as defined in section 1813(p) of this title), upon application to and examination by the Corporation and approval by the Board of Directors, may become an insured depository institution.
<br>(2) Interim depository institutions
<br>
<br>In the case of any interim Federal depository institution that is chartered by the appropriate Federal banking agency and will not open for business, the depository institution shall be an insured depository institution upon the issuance of the institution's charter by the agency.
<br>(3) Application and approval not required in cases of continued insurance
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of any depository institution whose insured status is continued pursuant to section 1814 of this title.
<br>(4) Review requirements
<br>
<br>In reviewing any application under this subsection, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors described in section 1816 of this title in determining whether to approve the application for insurance.
<br>(5) Notice of denial of application for insurance
<br>
<br>If the Board of Directors votes to deny any application for insurance by any depository institution, the Board of Directors shall promptly notify the appropriate Federal banking agency and, in the case of any State depository institution, the appropriate State banking supervisor of the denial of such application, giving specific reasons in writing for the Board of Directors' determination with reference to the factors described in section 1816 of this title.
<br>(6) Nondelegation requirement
<br>
<br>The authority of the Board of Directors to make any determination to deny any application under this subsection may not be delegated by the Board of Directors.
<br>(b) Foreign branch nonmember banks; matters considered
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of this chapter and to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may impose, any branch of a foreign bank, upon application by the bank to the Corporation, and examination by the Corporation of the branch, and approval by the Board of Directors, may become an insured branch. Before approving any such application, the Board of Directors shall give consideration to—
<br>
<br>(1) the financial history and condition of the bank,
<br>
<br>(2) the adequacy of its capital structure,
<br>
<br>(3) its future earnings prospects,
<br>
<br>(4) the general character and fitness of its management, including but not limited to the management of the branch proposed to be insured,
<br>
<br>(5) the risk presented to the Deposit Insurance Fund,
<br>
<br>(6) the convenience and needs of the community to be served by the branch,
<br>
<br>(7) whether or not its corporate powers, insofar as they will be exercised through the proposed insured branch, are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and
<br>
<br>(8) the probable adequacy and reliability of information supplied and to be supplied by the bank to the Corporation to enable it to carry out its functions under this chapter.
<br>(c) Protection to Deposit Insurance Fund; surety bond, pledge of assets, etc.; injunction
<br>
<br>(1) Before any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall deliver to the Corporation or as the Corporation may direct a surety bond, a pledge of assets, or both, in such amounts and of such types as the Corporation may require or approve, for the purpose set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) After any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall maintain on deposit with the Corporation, or as the Corporation may direct, surety bonds or assets or both, in such amounts and of such types as shall be determined from time to time in accordance with such regulations as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Such regulations may impose differing requirements on the basis of any factors which in the judgment of the Board of Directors are reasonably related to the purpose set forth in paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(3) The Corporation may require of any given bank larger deposits of bonds and assets than required under paragraph (2) of this subsection if, in the judgment of the Corporation, the situation of that bank or any branch thereof is or becomes such that the deposits of bonds and assets otherwise required under this section would not adequately fulfill the purpose set forth in paragraph (4). The imposition of any such additional requirements may be without notice or opportunity for hearing, but the Corporation shall afford an opportunity to any such bank to apply for a reduction or removal of any such additional requirements so imposed.
<br>
<br>(4) The purpose of the surety bonds and pledges of assets required under this subsection is to provide protection to the Deposit Insurance Fund against the risks entailed in insuring the domestic deposits of a foreign bank whose activities, assets, and personnel are in large part outside the jurisdiction of the United States. In the implementation of its authority under this subsection, however, the Corporation shall endeavor to avoid imposing requirements on such banks which would unnecessarily place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestically incorporated banks.
<br>
<br>(5) In the case of any failure or threatened failure of a foreign bank to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection (c), the Corporation, in addition to all other administrative and judicial remedies, may apply to any United States district court, or United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which any branch of the bank is located, for an injunction to compel such bank and any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or any other person having custody or control of any of its assets, to deliver to the Corporation such assets as may be necessary to meet such requirement, and to take any other action necessary to vest the Corporation with control of assets so delivered. If the court shall determine that there has been any such failure or threatened failure to comply with any such requirement, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction. The propriety of the requirement may be litigated only as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, and may not be made an issue in an action for an injunction under this paragraph.
<br>(d) Insurance fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any institution that becomes insured by the Corporation, and any noninsured branch that becomes insured by the Corporation, shall pay the Corporation any fee which the Corporation may by regulation prescribe, after giving due consideration to the need to establish and maintain the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>(2) Fee credited to the Deposit Insurance Fund
<br>
<br>The fee paid by the depository institution under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>(3) Exception for certain depository institutions
<br>
<br>Any depository institution that becomes an insured depository institution by operation of section 1814(a) of this title shall not pay any fee.

<br>
<br>(ii) any assistance provided by the Corporation to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default.

<br>No insured depository institution shall be liable to the Corporation under subparagraph (A) if written notice with respect to such liability is not received by such institution before the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date the Corporation incurred the loss.
<br>(2) Amount of compensation; procedures
<br>(A) Use of estimates
<br>
<br>When an insured depository institution is in default or requires assistance to prevent default, the Corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(i) in good faith, estimate the amount of the loss the Corporation will incur from such default or assistance;
<br>
<br>(ii) if, with respect to such insured depository institution, there is more than 1 commonly controlled insured depository institution, estimate the amount of each such commonly controlled depository institution's share of such liability; and
<br>
<br>(iii) advise each commonly controlled depository institution of the Corporation's estimate of the amount of such institution's liability for such losses.
<br>(B) Procedures; immediate payment
<br>
<br>The Corporation, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency and the appropriate State chartering agency, shall—

<br>
<br>(ii) require any insured depository institution to make immediate payment of the amount of such institution's liability under paragraph (1) in connection with any commonly controlled insured depository institution.
<br>(C) Priority
<br>

<br>The liability shall be subordinate in right and payment to the following obligations and liabilities of the depository institution:

<br>
<br>(III) Any other general or senior liability (which is not a liability described in clause (i)).
<br>
<br>(IV) Any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors (which is not an obligation described in clause (i)).
<br>(D) Adjustment of estimated payment
<br>(i) Overpayment
<br>

<br>

<br>(4) Limitation on rights of private parties
<br>
<br>To the extent the exercise of any right or power of any person would impair the ability of any insured depository institution to perform such institution's obligations under this subsection—
<br>

<br>(B) no court may give effect to such right or power with respect to such insured depository institution.
<br>(5) Waiver authority

<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The Corporation may, in its discretion, exempt any limited partnership and any affiliate of any limited partnership (other than any insured depository institution which is a majority owned subsidiary of such partnership) from the provisions of this subsection if such limited partnership or affiliate has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before April 10, 1989, indicating that as of the date of such filing such partnership intended to acquire 1 or more insured depository institutions.

<br>

<br>(7) Exception for certain FSLIC assisted institutions
<br>
<br>No depository institution shall have any liability to the Corporation under this subsection as the result of the default of, or assistance provided with respect to, an insured depository institution which is an affiliate of such depository institution if—

<br>(a) Reports of condition; access to reports
<br>
<br>(1) Each insured State nonmember bank and each foreign bank having an insured branch which is not a Federal branch shall make to the Corporation reports of condition which shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board of Directors may require. Such reports shall be made to the Corporation on the dates selected as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and the deposit liabilities shall be reported therein in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. The Board of Directors may call for additional reports of condition on dates to be fixed by it and may call for such other reports as the Board may from time to time require. Any such bank which (A) maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or (B) inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Such bank shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any such bank which fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any such bank knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Corporation may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such bank, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Corporation in the manner provided in subparagraphs (E), (F), (G), and (I) of section 1818(i)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any such bank against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such bank submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1818(h) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Corporation and, with respect to any State depository institution, any appropriate State bank supervisor for such institution, shall have access to reports of examination made by, and reports of condition made to, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, any Federal home loan bank, or any Federal Reserve bank and to all revisions of reports of condition made to any of them, and they shall promptly advise the Corporation of any revisions or changes in respect to deposit liabilities made or required to be made in any report of condition. The Corporation may accept any report made by or to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a depository institution, and may furnish to the Comptroller of the Currency, to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to any Federal home loan bank, to any Federal Reserve bank, and to any such commission, board, or authority, reports of examinations made on behalf of, and reports of condition made to, the Corporation.
<br>
<br>(B) Additional reports.—The Board of Directors may from time to time require any insured depository institution to file such additional reports as the Corporation, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as appropriate, may deem advisable for insurance purposes.
<br>
<br>(C) Data sharing with other agencies and persons.—In addition to reports of examination, reports of condition, and other reports required to be regularly provided to the Corporation (with respect to all insured depository institutions, including a depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed conservator or receiver) or an appropriate State bank supervisor (with respect to a State depository institution) under subparagraph (A) or (B), a Federal banking agency may, in the discretion of the agency, furnish any report of examination or other confidential supervisory information concerning any depository institution or other entity examined by such agency under authority of any Federal law, to—
<br>
<br>(i) any other Federal or State agency or authority with supervisory or regulatory authority over the depository institution or other entity;
<br>
<br>(ii) any officer, director, or receiver of such depository institution or entity; and
<br>
<br>(iii) any other person that the Federal banking agency determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(3) Each insured depository institution shall make to the appropriate Federal banking agency 4 reports of condition annually upon dates which shall be selected by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The dates selected shall be the same for all insured depository institutions, except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any depository institution, the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. Such reports of condition shall be the basis for the certified statements to be filed pursuant to subsection (c). The deposit liabilities shall be reported in said reports of conditions in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection, and such other information shall be reported therein as may be required by the respective agencies. Each said report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, a vice president, the cashier or the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. The correctness of said report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of at least two directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution other than the officer making such declaration, with a declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct. At the time of making said reports of condition each insured depository institution shall furnish to the Corporation a copy thereof containing such signed declaration and attestations. Nothing herein shall preclude any of the foregoing agencies from requiring the banks or savings associations under its jurisdiction to make additional reports of condition at any time.
<br>
<br>(4) In the reports of condition required to be made by paragraph (3) of this subsection, each insured depository institution shall report the total amount of the liability of the depository institution for deposits in the main office and in any branch located in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any Territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, according to the definition of the term "deposit" in and pursuant to subsection (l) of section 1813 of this title without any deduction for indebtedness of depositors or creditors or any deduction for cash items in the process of collection drawn on others than the reporting depository institution: Provided, That the depository institution in reporting such deposits may (i) subtract from the deposit balance due to any depository institution the deposit balance due from the same depository institution (other than trust funds deposited by either depository institution) and any cash items in the process of collection due from or due to such depository institutions shall be included in determining such net balance, except that balances of time deposits of any depository institution and any balances standing to the credit of private depository institutions, of depository institutions in foreign countries, of foreign branches of other American depository institutions, and of American branches of foreign banks shall be reported gross without any such subtraction, and (ii) exclude any deposits received in any office of the depository institution for deposit in any other office of the depository institution: And provided further, That outstanding drafts (including advices and authorizations to charge depository institution's balance in another depository institution) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting depository institution on depository institutions need not be reported as deposit liabilities. The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution's own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.
<br>
<br>(5) The deposits to be reported on such reports of condition shall be segregated between (i) time and savings deposits and (ii) demand deposits. For this purpose, the time and savings deposits shall consist of time certificates of deposit, time deposits-open account, and savings deposits; and demand deposits shall consist of all deposits other than time and savings deposits.
<br>
<br>(6) Lifeline account deposits.—In the reports of condition required to be reported under this subsection, the deposits in lifeline accounts (as defined in section 1834(a)(3)(D) of this title) shall be reported separately.
<br>
<br>(7) The Board of Directors, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may by regulation define the terms "cash items" and "process of collection", and shall classify deposits as "time", "savings", and "demand" deposits, for the purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>(8) In respect of any report required or authorized to be supplied or published pursuant to this subsection or any other provision of law, the Board of Directors or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may differentiate between domestic banks and foreign banks to such extent as, in their judgment, may be reasonably required to avoid hardship and can be done without substantial compromise of insurance risk or supervisory and regulatory effectiveness.
<br>
<br>(9) Data collections.—In addition to or in connection with any other report required under this subsection, the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) each insured depository institution maintains; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Corporation receives on a regular basis from such institution,
<br>
<br>information on the total amount of all insured deposits, preferred deposits, and uninsured deposits at the institution. In prescribing reporting and other requirements for the collection of actual and accurate information pursuant to this paragraph, the Corporation shall minimize the regulatory burden imposed upon insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in section 1831o of this title) while taking into account the benefit of the information to the Corporation, including the use of the information to enable the Corporation to more accurately determine the total amount of insured deposits in each insured depository institution for purposes of compliance with this chapter.
<br>
<br>(10) A Federal banking agency may not, by regulation or otherwise, designate, or require an insured institution or an affiliate to designate, a corporation as highly leveraged or a transaction with a corporation as a highly leveraged transaction solely because such corporation is or has been a debtor or bankrupt under title 11, if, after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, such corporation would not otherwise be highly leveraged.
<br>
<br>(11) Streamlining reports of condition.—
<br>
<br>(A) Review of information and schedules.—Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on October 13, 2006, and before the end of each 5-year period thereafter, each Federal banking agency shall, in conjunction with the other relevant Federal banking agencies, review the information and schedules that are required to be filed by an insured depository institution in a report of condition required under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(B) Reduction or elimination of information found to be unnecessary.—After completing the review required by subparagraph (A), a Federal banking agency, in conjunction with the other relevant Federal banking agencies, shall reduce or eliminate any requirement to file information or schedules under paragraph (3) (other than information or schedules that are otherwise required by law) if the agency determines that the continued collection of such information or schedules is no longer necessary or appropriate.
<br>
<br>(12) Short form reporting.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall issue regulations that allow for a reduced reporting requirement for a covered depository institution when the institution makes the first and third report of condition for a year, as required under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(B) Definition.—In this paragraph, the term "covered depository institution" means an insured depository institution that—
<br>
<br>(i) has less than $5,000,000,000 in total consolidated assets; and
<br>
<br>(ii) satisfies such other criteria as the appropriate Federal banking agencies determine appropriate.
<br>(b) Assessments
<br>(1) Risk-based assessment system
<br>(A) Risk-based assessment system required
<br>
<br>The Board of Directors shall, by regulation, establish a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions.
<br>(B) Private reinsurance authorized
<br>
<br>In carrying out this paragraph, the Corporation may—
<br>
<br>(i) obtain private reinsurance covering not more than 10 percent of any loss the Corporation incurs with respect to an insured depository institution; and
<br>
<br>(ii) base that institution's assessment (in whole or in part) on the cost of the reinsurance.
<br>(C) "Risk-based assessment system" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "risk-based assessment system" means a system for calculating a depository institution's assessment based on—
<br>
<br>(i) the probability that the Deposit Insurance Fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution, taking into consideration the risks attributable to—
<br>
<br>(I) different categories and concentrations of assets;
<br>
<br>(II) different categories and concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured, contingent and noncontingent; and
<br>
<br>(III) any other factors the Corporation determines are relevant to assessing such probability;
<br>
<br>(ii) the likely amount of any such loss; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the revenue needs of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>(D) Separate assessment systems
<br>
<br>The Board of Directors may establish separate risk-based assessment systems for large and small members of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>(E) Information concerning risk of loss and economic conditions
<br>(i) Sources of information
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining risk of losses at insured depository institutions and economic conditions generally affecting depository institutions, the Corporation shall collect information, as appropriate, from all sources the Board of Directors considers appropriate, including reports of condition, inspection reports, and other information from all Federal banking agencies, any information available from State bank supervisors, State insurance and securities regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (including information described in section 1831l of this title), the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, any Federal reserve bank or Federal home loan bank, and other regulators of financial institutions, and any information available from private economic, credit, or business analysts.
<br>(ii) Consultation with Federal banking agencies
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subclause (II), in assessing the risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund with respect to any insured depository institution, the Corporation shall consult with the appropriate Federal banking agency of such institution.
<br>(II) Treatment on aggregate basis
<br>
<br>In the case of insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in section 1831o of this title) and, in the most recent examination, were found to be well managed, the consultation under subclause (I) concerning the assessment of the risk of loss posed by such institutions may be made on an aggregate basis.
<br>(iii) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as providing any new authority for the Corporation to require submission of information by insured depository institutions to the Corporation, except as provided in subsection (a)(2)(B).
<br>(F) Modifications to the risk-based assessment system allowed only after notice and comment
<br>
<br>In revising or modifying the risk-based assessment system at any time after February 8, 2006, the Board of Directors may implement such revisions or modification in final form only after notice and opportunity for comment.
<br>(2) Setting assessments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board of Directors shall set assessments for insured depository institutions in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine to be necessary or appropriate, subject to subparagraph (D).1
<br>(B) Factors to be considered
<br>
<br>In setting assessments under subparagraph (A), the Board of Directors shall consider the following factors:
<br>
<br>(i) The estimated operating expenses of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>
<br>(ii) The estimated case resolution expenses and income of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>
<br>(iii) The projected effects of the payment of assessments on the capital and earnings of insured depository institutions.
<br>
<br>(iv) The risk factors and other factors taken into account pursuant to paragraph (1) under the risk-based assessment system, including the requirement under such paragraph to maintain a risk-based system.
<br>
<br>(v) Any other factors the Board of Directors may determine to be appropriate.
<br>(D) 2 Notice of assessments
<br>
<br>The Corporation shall notify each insured depository institution of that institution's assessment.
<br>(E) Bank Enterprise Act requirement
<br>
<br>The Corporation shall design the risk-based assessment system so that, insofar as the system bases assessments, directly or indirectly, on deposits, the portion of the deposits of any insured depository institution which are attributable to lifeline accounts established in accordance with the Bank Enterprise Act of 1991 shall be subject to assessment at a rate determined in accordance with such Act.
<br>(3) Designated reserve ratio
<br>(A) Establishment
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Before the beginning of each calendar year, the Board of Directors shall designate the reserve ratio applicable with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund and publish the reserve ratio so designated.
<br>(ii) Rulemaking requirement
<br>
<br>Any change to the designated reserve ratio shall be made by the Board of Directors by regulation after notice and opportunity for comment.
<br>(B) Minimum reserve ratio
<br>
<br>The reserve ratio designated by the Board of Directors for any year may not be less than 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits, or the comparable percentage of the assessment base set forth in paragraph (2)(C).2
<br>(C) Factors
<br>
<br>In designating a reserve ratio for any year, the Board of Directors shall—
<br>
<br>(i) take into account the risk of losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund in such year and future years, including historic experience and potential and estimated losses from insured depository institutions;
<br>
<br>(ii) take into account economic conditions generally affecting insured depository institutions so as to allow the designated reserve ratio to increase during more favorable economic conditions and to decrease during less favorable economic conditions, notwithstanding the increased risks of loss that may exist during such less favorable conditions, as determined to be appropriate by the Board of Directors;
<br>
<br>(iii) seek to prevent sharp swings in the assessment rates for insured depository institutions; and
<br>
<br>(iv) take into account such other factors as the Board of Directors may determine to be appropriate, consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph.
<br>(D) Publication of proposed change in ratio
<br>
<br>In soliciting comment on any proposed change in the designated reserve ratio in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Board of Directors shall include in the published proposal a thorough analysis of the data and projections on which the proposal is based.
<br>(E) DIF restoration plans
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever—
<br>
<br>(I) the Corporation projects that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund will, within 6 months of such determination, fall below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio; or
<br>
<br>(II) the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund actually falls below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio without any determination under subclause (I) having been made,
<br>
<br> the Corporation shall establish and implement a Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan within 90 days that meets the requirements of clause (ii) and such other conditions as the Corporation determines to be appropriate.
<br>(ii) Requirements of restoration plan
<br>
<br>A Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan meets the requirements of this clause if the plan provides that the reserve ratio of the Fund will meet or exceed the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio before the end of the 8-year period beginning upon the implementation of the plan (or such longer period as the Corporation may determine to be necessary due to extraordinary circumstances).
<br>(iii) Restriction on assessment credits
<br>
<br>As part of any restoration plan under this subparagraph, the Corporation may elect to restrict the application of assessment credits provided under subsection (e)(3) for any period that the plan is in effect.
<br>(iv) Limitation on restriction
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (iii), while any restoration plan under this subparagraph is in effect, the Corporation shall apply credits provided to an insured depository institution under subsection (e)(3) against any assessment imposed on the institution for any assessment period in an amount equal to the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount of the assessment; or
<br>
<br>(II) the amount equal to 3 basis points of the institution's assessment base.
<br>(v) Transparency
<br>
<br>Not more than 30 days after the Corporation establishes and implements a restoration plan under clause (i), the Corporation shall publish in the Federal Register a detailed analysis of the factors considered and the basis for the actions taken with regard to the plan.
<br>(4) Depository institution required to maintain assessment-related records
<br>
<br>Each insured depository institution shall maintain all records that the Corporation may require for verifying the correctness of any assessment on the insured depository institution under this subsection until the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the end of the 3-year period beginning on the due date of the assessment; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a dispute between the insured depository institution and the Corporation with respect to such assessment, the date of a final determination of any such dispute.
<br>(5) Emergency special assessments
<br>
<br>In addition to the other assessments imposed on insured depository institutions under this subsection, the Corporation may impose 1 or more special assessments on insured depository institutions in an amount determined by the Corporation if the amount of any such assessment is necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide sufficient assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the Secretary of the Treasury under section 1824(a) of this title in accordance with the repayment schedule in effect under section 1824(c) of this title during the period with respect to which such assessment is imposed;
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) for any other purpose that the Corporation may deem necessary.
<br>(6) Community enterprise credits
