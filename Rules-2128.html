<br>§340. Significantly viewed signals permitted to be carried
<br>(a) Significantly viewed stations
<br>
<br>In addition to the broadcast signals that subscribers may receive under section 1 338 and 339 of this title, a satellite carrier is also authorized to retransmit to a subscriber located in a community the signal of any station located outside the local market in which such subscriber is located, to the extent such signal—
<br>
<br>(1) has, before December 8, 2004, been determined by the Federal Communications Commission to be a signal a cable operator may carry as significantly viewed in such community, except to the extent that such signal is prevented from being carried by a cable system in such community under the Commission's network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; or
<br>
<br>(2) is, after December 8, 2004, determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed in such community in accordance with the same standards and procedures concerning shares of viewing hours and audience surveys as are applicable under the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Commission to determining with respect to a cable system whether signals are significantly viewed in a community.
<br>(b) Limitations
<br>(1) Service limited to subscribers taking local-into-local service
<br>
<br>This section shall apply only to retransmissions to subscribers of a satellite carrier who receive retransmissions of a signal from that satellite carrier pursuant to section 338 of this title.
<br>(2) Service limitations
<br>
<br>A satellite carrier may retransmit to a subscriber in high definition format the signal of a station determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed under subsection (a) only if such carrier also retransmits in high definition format the signal of a station located in the local market of such subscriber and affiliated with the same network whenever such format is available from such station.
<br>(3) Limitation not applicable where no network affiliates
<br>
<br>The limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission under this section to a subscriber located in a local market in which there are no network stations affiliated with the same television network as the station whose signal is being retransmitted pursuant to this section.
<br>(4) Authority to grant station-specific waivers
<br>
<br>Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission of a network station to a subscriber if and to the extent that the network station in the local market in which the subscriber is located, and that is affiliated with the same television network, has privately negotiated and affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of paragraph 2 (1) and (2) to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of the significantly viewed station to such subscriber.
<br>(c) Publication and modifications of lists; regulations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) within 60 days after December 8, 2004—
<br>
<br>(i) publish a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a)(1) and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and
<br>
<br>(ii) commence a rulemaking proceeding to implement this section by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking;
<br>
<br>(B) adopt rules pursuant to such rulemaking within 1 year after December 8, 2004.
<br>(2) Public availability of list
<br>
<br>The Commission shall make readily available to the public in electronic form, on the Internet website of the Commission or other comparable facility, a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a) and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission. The Commission shall update such list within 10 business days after the date on which the Commission issues an order making any modification of such stations and communities.
<br>(3) Modifications
<br>
<br>In addition to cable operators and television broadcast station licensees, the Commission shall permit a satellite carrier to petition for decisions and orders—
<br>
<br>(A) by which stations may be added to those that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a), and by which communities may be added in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and
<br>
<br>(B) by which network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations are applied to the retransmission in accordance with subsection (e).
<br>(d) Effect on other obligations and rights
<br>(1) No effect on carriage obligations
<br>
<br>Carriage of a signal under this section is not mandatory, and any right of a station licensee to have the signal of such station carried under section 338 of this title is not affected by the eligibility of such station to be carried under this section.
<br>(2) Retransmission consent rights not affected
<br>
<br>The eligibility of the signal of a station to be carried under this section does not affect any right of the licensee of such station to grant (or withhold) retransmission consent under section 325(b)(1) of this title.
<br>(e) Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity
<br>(1) Not applicable except as provided by commission regulations
<br>
<br>Signals eligible to be carried under this section are not subject to the Commission's regulations concerning network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity unless, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Commission, the Commission determines to permit network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity to apply within the appropriate zone of protection.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection or Commission regulations shall permit the application of network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations to the retransmission of distant signals of network stations that are carried by a satellite carrier pursuant to a statutory license under section 119(a)(2)(A) or (B) of title 17, with respect to persons who reside in unserved households, under 3 119(a)(4)(A),4 or under section 119(a)(12),4 of such title.
<br>(f) Enforcement
<br>(1) Orders and damages
<br>
<br>Upon complaint, the Commission shall issue a cease and desist order to any satellite carrier found to have violated this section in carrying any television broadcast station. Such order may, if a complaining station requests damages—
<br>
<br>(A) provide for the award of damages to a complaining station that establishes that the violation was committed in bad faith, in an amount up to $50 per subscriber, per station, per day of the violation; and
<br>
<br>(B) provide for the award of damages to a prevailing satellite carrier if the Commission determines that the complaint was frivolous, in an amount up to $50 per subscriber alleged to be in violation, per station alleged, per day of the alleged violation.
<br>(2) Commission decision
<br>
<br>The Commission shall issue a final determination resolving a complaint brought under this subsection not later than 180 days after the submission of a complaint under this subsection. The Commission may hear witnesses if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.
<br>(3) Remedies in addition
<br>
<br>The remedies under this subsection are in addition to any remedies available under title 17.

<br>
<br>(3) Definition of Eligible County.—For purposes of this section, the term "eligible county" means any 1 of 4 counties that—
<br>
<br>(A) are all in a single State;
<br>
<br>(B) on January 1, 2004, were each in designated market areas in which the majority of counties were located in another State or States; and
<br>
<br>(C) as a group had a combined total of 41,340 television households according to the U.S. Television Household Estimates by Nielsen Media Research for 2003–2004.
<br>
<br>(4) Limitation.—Carriage of a station under this section shall be at the option of the cable operator or satellite carrier.
<br>
<br>(b) Certain Markets.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a satellite carrier may not carry the signal of a television station into an adjacent local market that is comprised of only a portion of a county, other than to unserved households located in that county.

<br>(June 19, 1934, ch. 652, title III, §341, as added Pub. L. 108–447, div. J, title IX [title II, §211], Dec. 8, 2004, 118 Stat. 3430.)
<br>§342. Process for issuing qualified carrier certification
<br>(a) Certification
<br>
<br>The Commission shall issue a certification for the purposes of section 119(g)(3)(A)(iii) 1 of title 17 if the Commission determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) a satellite carrier is providing local service pursuant to the statutory license under section 122 of such title in each designated market area; and
<br>
<br>(2) with respect to each designated market area in which such satellite carrier was not providing such local service as of the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010—
<br>
<br>(A) the satellite carrier's satellite beams are designed, and predicted by the satellite manufacturer's pre-launch test data, to provide a good quality satellite signal to at least 90 percent of the households in each such designated market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census Bureau; and
<br>
<br>(B) there is no material evidence that there has been a satellite or sub-system failure subsequent to the satellite's launch that precludes the ability of the satellite carrier to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A).
<br>(b) Information required
<br>
<br>Any entity seeking the certification provided for in subsection (a) shall submit to the Commission the following information:
<br>
<br>(1) An affidavit stating that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge, the satellite carrier provides local service in all designated market areas pursuant to the statutory license provided for in section 122 of title 17 and listing those designated market areas in which local service was provided as of the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010.
<br>
<br>(2) For each designated market area not listed in paragraph (1):
<br>
<br>(A) Identification of each such designated market area and the location of its local receive facility.
<br>
<br>(B) Data showing the number of households, and maps showing the geographic distribution thereof, in each such designated market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census Bureau.
<br>
<br>(C) Maps, with superimposed effective isotropically radiated power predictions obtained in the satellite manufacturer's pre-launch tests, showing that the contours of the carrier's satellite beams as designed and the geographic area that the carrier's satellite beams are designed to cover are predicted to provide a good quality satellite signal to at least 90 percent of the households in such designated market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census Bureau.
<br>
<br>(D) For any satellite relied upon for certification under this section, an affidavit stating that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge, there have been no satellite or sub-system failures subsequent to the satellite's launch that would degrade the design performance to such a degree that a satellite transponder used to provide local service to any such designated market area is precluded from delivering a good quality satellite signal to at least 90 percent of the households in such designated market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census Bureau.
<br>
<br>(E) Any additional engineering, designated market area, or other information the Commission considers necessary to determine whether the Commission shall grant a certification under this section.
<br>(c) Certification issuance
<br>(1) Public comment
<br>
<br>The Commission shall provide 30 days for public comment on a request for certification under this section.
<br>(2) Deadline for decision
<br>
<br>The Commission shall grant or deny a request for certification within 90 days after the date on which such request is filed.
<br>(d) Subsequent affirmation
<br>
<br>An entity granted qualified carrier status pursuant to section 119(g) 1 of title 17 shall file an affidavit with the Commission 30 months after such status was granted stating that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge, it is in compliance with the requirements for a qualified carrier.
<br>(e) Definitions
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section:
<br>(1) Designated market area
<br>
<br>The term "designated market area" has the meaning given such term in section 122(j)(2)(C) of title 17.
<br>(2) Good quality satellite signal
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "good quality satellite signal" means—
<br>
<br>(i) a satellite signal whose power level as designed shall achieve reception and demodulation of the signal at an availability level of at least 99.7 percent using—
<br>
<br>(I) models of satellite antennas normally used by the satellite carrier's subscribers; and
<br>
<br>(II) the same calculation methodology used by the satellite carrier to determine predicted signal availability in the top 100 designated market areas; and
<br>
<br>(ii) taking into account whether a signal is in standard definition format or high definition format, compression methodology, modulation, error correction, power level, and utilization of advances in technology that do not circumvent the intent of this section to provide for non-discriminatory treatment with respect to any comparable television broadcast station signal, a video signal transmitted by a satellite carrier such that—
<br>
<br>(I) the satellite carrier treats all television broadcast stations' signals the same with respect to statistical multiplexer prioritization; and
<br>
<br>(II) the number of video signals in the relevant satellite transponder is not more than the then current greatest number of video signals carried on any equivalent transponder serving the top 100 designated market areas.
<br>(B) Determination
<br>
<br>For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the top 100 designated market areas shall be as determined by Nielsen Media Research and published in the Nielsen Station Index Directory and Nielsen Station Index United States Television Household Estimates or any successor publication as of the date of a satellite carrier's application for certification under this section.
