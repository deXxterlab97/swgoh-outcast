<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13888. Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13888, Sept. 26, 2019, 84 F.R. 52355, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Purpose. In resettling refugees into American communities, it is the policy of the United States to cooperate and consult with State and local governments, to take into account the preferences of State governments, and to provide a pathway for refugees to become self-sufficient. These policies support each other. Close cooperation with State and local governments ensures that refugees are resettled in communities that are eager and equipped to support their successful integration into American society and the labor force.
<br>
<br>The Federal Government consults with State and local governments not only to identify the best environments for refugees, but also to be respectful of those communities that may not be able to accommodate refugee resettlement. State and local governments are best positioned to know the resources and capacities they may or may not have available to devote to sustainable resettlement, which maximizes the likelihood refugees placed in the area will become self-sufficient and free from long-term dependence on public assistance. Some States and localities, however, have viewed existing consultation as insufficient, and there is a need for closer coordination and a more clearly defined role for State and local governments in the refugee resettlement process. My Administration seeks to enhance these consultations.
<br>
<br>Section 6(d) of Executive Order 13780 of March 6, 2017 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States) [8 U.S.C. 1182 note], directed the Secretary of State to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions could have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and to devise a proposal to promote such involvement.
<br>
<br>I have consulted with the Secretary of State and determined that, with limited exceptions, the Federal Government, as an exercise of its broad discretion concerning refugee placement accorded to it by the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act, should resettle refugees only in those jurisdictions in which both the State and local governments have consented to receive refugees under the Department of State's Reception and Placement Program (Program).
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Consent of States and Localities to the Placement of Refugees. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order [Sept. 26, 2019], the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall develop and implement a process to determine whether the State and locality both consent, in writing, to the resettlement of refugees within the State and locality, before refugees are resettled within that State and locality under the Program. The Secretary of State shall publicly release any written consents of States and localities to resettlement of refugees.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall develop and implement a process by which, consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2)(D), the State and the locality's consent to the resettlement of refugees under the Program is taken into account to the maximum extent consistent with law. In particular, that process shall provide that, if either a State or locality has not provided consent to receive refugees under the Program, then refugees should not be resettled within that State or locality unless the Secretary of State concludes, following consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security, that failing to resettle refugees within that State or locality would be inconsistent with the policies and strategies established under 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2)(B) and (C) or other applicable law. If the Secretary of State intends to provide for the resettlement of refugees in a State or locality that has not provided consent, then the Secretary shall notify the President of such decision, along with the reasons for the decision, before proceeding.
<br>
<br>(c) Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to the resettlement of a refugee's spouse or child following to join that refugee pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1157(c)(2)(A).
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>§1523. Congressional reports
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall submit a report on activities under this subchapter to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate not later than the January 31 following the end of each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1980.
<br>
<br>(b) Each such report shall contain—
<br>
<br>(1) an updated profile of the employment and labor force statistics for refugees who have entered the United States within the five-fiscal-year period immediately preceding the fiscal year within which the report is to be made and for refugees who entered earlier and who have shown themselves to be significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare, as well as a description of the extent to which refugees received the forms of assistance or services under this subchapter during that period;
<br>
<br>(2) a description of the geographic location of refugees;
<br>
<br>(3) a summary of the results of the monitoring and evaluation conducted under section 1522(a)(7) of this title during the period for which the report is submitted;
<br>
<br>(4) a description of (A) the activities, expenditures, and policies of the Office under this subchapter and of the activities of States, voluntary agencies, and sponsors, and (B) the Director's plans for improvement of refugee resettlement;
<br>
<br>(5) evaluations of the extent to which (A) the services provided under this subchapter are assisting refugees in achieving economic self-sufficiency, achieving ability in English, and achieving employment commensurate with their skills and abilities, and (B) any fraud, abuse, or mismanagement has been reported in the provisions of services or assistance;
<br>
<br>(6) a description of any assistance provided by the Director pursuant to section 1522(e)(5) of this title;
<br>
<br>(7) a summary of the location and status of unaccompanied refugee children admitted to the United States; and
<br>
<br>(8) a summary of the information compiled and evaluation made under section 1522(a)(8) of this title.

<br>§1534. Removal hearing
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Expeditious hearing
<br>
<br>In any case in which an application for an order is approved under section 1533(c)(2) of this title, a removal hearing shall be conducted under this section as expeditiously as practicable for the purpose of determining whether the alien to whom the order pertains should be removed from the United States on the grounds that the alien is an alien terrorist.

<br>(c) Rights in hearing
<br>(1) Right of counsel
<br>
<br>The alien shall have a right to be present at such hearing and to be represented by counsel. Any alien financially unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to have counsel assigned to represent the alien. Such counsel shall be appointed by the judge pursuant to the plan for furnishing representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation for the district in which the hearing is conducted, as provided for in section 3006A of title 18. All provisions of that section shall apply and, for purposes of determining the maximum amount of compensation, the matter shall be treated as if a felony was charged.

Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.
<br>(2) Payment for attendance
<br>
<br>If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for the enforcement of subchapter II.
<br>(3) Nationwide service
<br>
<br>A subpoena under this subsection may be served anywhere in the United States.

<br>Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow an alien to have access to classified information.
<br>(e) Discovery
<br>(1) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) an alien subject to removal under this subchapter shall not be entitled to suppress evidence that the alien alleges was unlawfully obtained; and
<br>
<br>(C) section 3504 of title 18 and section 1806(c) of title 50 shall not apply if the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States because it would disclose classified information or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending investigation.
<br>(2) Protective orders
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and from asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.
<br>(3) Treatment of classified information
<br>(A) Use
<br>
<br>The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States or to the security of any individual because it would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case of classified information, after coordination with the originating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open session.
<br>(B) Submission
<br>
<br>With respect to such information, the Government shall submit to the removal court an unclassified summary of the specific evidence that does not pose that risk.
<br>(C) Approval
<br>
<br>Not later than 15 days after submission, the judge shall approve the summary if the judge finds that it is sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense. The Government shall deliver to the alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under this subparagraph.
<br>(D) Disapproval
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If an unclassified summary is not approved by the removal court under subparagraph (C), the Government shall be afforded 15 days to correct the deficiencies identified by the court and submit a revised unclassified summary.
<br>(ii) Revised summary
<br>
<br>If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated unless the judge makes the findings under clause (iii).
<br>(iii) Findings
<br>
<br>The findings described in this clause are, with respect to an alien, that—
<br>
<br>(I) the continued presence of the alien in the United States would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person, and
<br>
<br>(II) the provision of the summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person.
<br>(E) Continuation of hearing without summary
<br>
<br>If a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph (D)(iii)—
<br>
<br>(i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, the procedures described in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is possible, and the classified information submitted in camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>(F) Special procedures for access and challenges to classified information by special attorneys in case of lawful permanent aliens
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The procedures described in this subparagraph are that the judge (under rules of the removal court) shall designate a special attorney to assist the alien—
<br>
<br>(I) by reviewing in camera the classified information on behalf of the alien, and
<br>
<br>(II) by challenging through an in camera proceeding the veracity of the evidence contained in the classified information.
<br>(ii) Restrictions on disclosure
<br>
<br>A special attorney receiving classified information under clause (i)—
<br>
<br>(I) shall not disclose the information to the alien or to any other attorney representing the alien, and
<br>
<br>(II) who discloses such information in violation of subclause (I) shall be subject to a fine under title 18, imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 25 years, or both.
<br>(f) Arguments
<br>
<br>Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.
<br>(g) Burden of proof
<br>
<br>In the hearing, it is the Government's burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is subject to removal because the alien is an alien terrorist.
<br>(h) Rules of evidence
<br>
<br>The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal hearing.
<br>(i) Determination of deportation
<br>
<br>If the judge, after considering the evidence on the record as a whole, finds that the Government has met its burden, the judge shall order the alien removed and detained pending removal from the United States. If the alien was released pending the removal hearing, the judge shall order the Attorney General to take the alien into custody.
<br>(j) Written order
<br>
<br>At the time of issuing a decision as to whether the alien shall be removed, the judge shall prepare a written order containing a statement of facts found and conclusions of law. Any portion of the order that would reveal the substance or source of information received in camera and ex parte pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be made available to the alien or the public.
<br>(k) No right to ancillary relief
<br>
<br>At no time shall the judge consider or provide for relief from removal based on—
<br>
<br>(1) asylum under section 1158 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) by 2 withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) cancellation of removal under section 1229b of this title;
<br>
<br>(4) voluntary departure under section 1254a(e) 3 of this title;
<br>
<br>(5) adjustment of status under section 1255 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(6) registry under section 1259 of this title.
<br>(l) Report on terrorist removal proceedings
<br>
<br>Not later than 3 months from December 28, 2001, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report concerning the effect and efficacy of alien terrorist removal proceedings, including the reasons why proceedings pursuant to this section have not been used by the Attorney General in the past and the effect on the use of these proceedings after the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Public Law 107–56).

<br>(1) Custody
<br>
<br>If the judge decides that an alien shall be removed, the alien shall be detained pending the outcome of any appeal. After the conclusion of any judicial review thereof which affirms the removal order, the Attorney General shall retain the alien in custody and remove the alien to a country specified under paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Removal
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The removal of an alien shall be to any country which the alien shall designate if such designation does not, in the judgment of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, impair the obligation of the United States under any treaty (including a treaty pertaining to extradition) or otherwise adversely affect the foreign policy of the United States.
<br>(B) Alternate countries
<br>
<br>If the alien refuses to designate a country to which the alien wishes to be removed or if the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that removal of the alien to the country so designated would impair a treaty obligation or adversely affect United States foreign policy, the Attorney General shall cause the alien to be removed to any country willing to receive such alien.
<br>(C) Continued detention
<br>
<br>If no country is willing to receive such an alien, the Attorney General may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, retain the alien in custody. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall make periodic efforts to reach agreement with other countries to accept such an alien and at least every 6 months shall provide to the attorney representing the alien at the removal hearing a written report on the Attorney General's efforts. Any alien in custody pursuant to this subparagraph shall be released from custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General and subject to such conditions as the Attorney General shall deem appropriate.

<br>(2) Maintenance of custody
<br>
<br>Pending the commencement of any service of a sentence of confinement by an alien described in paragraph (1), such an alien shall remain in the custody of the Attorney General, unless the Attorney General determines that temporary release of the alien to the custody of State authorities for confinement in a State facility is appropriate and would not endanger national security or public safety.
<br>(3) Subsequent removal
<br>
<br>Following the completion of a sentence of confinement by an alien described in paragraph (1), or following the completion of State criminal proceedings which do not result in a sentence of confinement of an alien released to the custody of State authorities pursuant to paragraph (2), such an alien shall be returned to the custody of the Attorney General who shall proceed to the removal of the alien under this subchapter.
<br>(d) Application of certain provisions relating to escape of prisoners
<br>
<br>For purposes of sections 751 and 752 of title 18, an alien in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to this subchapter shall be subject to the penalties provided by those sections in relation to a person committed to the custody of the Attorney General by virtue of an arrest on a charge of a felony.
