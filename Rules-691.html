<br>§632. Definitions
<br>(a) Small business concerns
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this chapter, a small-business concern, including but not limited to enterprises that are engaged in the business of production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries, shall be deemed to be one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.
<br>(2) Establishment of size standards
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In addition to the criteria specified in paragraph (1), the Administrator may specify detailed definitions or standards by which a business concern may be determined to be a small business concern for the purposes of this chapter or any other Act.
<br>(B) Additional criteria
<br>
<br>The standards described in paragraph (1) may utilize number of employees, dollar volume of business, net worth, net income, a combination thereof, or other appropriate factors.
<br>(C) Requirements
<br>
<br>Unless specifically authorized by statute, no Federal department or agency may prescribe a size standard for categorizing a business concern as a small business concern, unless such proposed size standard—
<br>
<br>(i) is proposed after an opportunity for public notice and comment;
<br>
<br>(ii) provides for determining—
<br>
<br>(I) the size of a manufacturing concern as measured by the manufacturing concern's average employment based upon employment during each of the manufacturing concern's pay periods for the preceding 12 months;
<br>
<br>(II) the size of a business concern providing services on the basis of the annual average gross receipts of the business concern over a period of not less than 5 years;
<br>
<br>(III) the size of other business concerns on the basis of data over a period of not less than 3 years; or
<br>
<br>(IV) other appropriate factors; and
<br>
<br>(iii) is approved by the Administrator.
<br>(3) Variation by industry and consideration of other factors
<br>
<br>When establishing or approving any size standard pursuant to paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ensure that the size standard varies from industry to industry to the extent necessary to reflect the differing characteristics of the various industries and consider other factors deemed to be relevant by the Administrator.
<br>(4) Exclusion of certain security expenses from consideration for purpose of small business size standards
<br>(A) Determination required
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall review the application of size standards established pursuant to paragraph (2) to small business concerns that are performing contracts in qualified areas and determine whether it would be fair and appropriate to exclude from consideration in the average annual gross receipts of such small business concerns any payments made to such small business concerns by Federal agencies to reimburse such small business concerns for the cost of subcontracts entered for the sole purpose of providing security services in a qualified area.
<br>(B) Action required
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall either—
<br>
<br>(i) initiate an adjustment to the size standards, as described in subparagraph (A), if the Administrator determines that such an adjustment would be fair and appropriate; or
<br>

<br>(B) Interim rule
<br>
<br>Until the date on which the alternative size standard established under subparagraph (A) is in effect, an applicant for a business loan under section 636(a) of this title or an applicant for a development company loan under title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 may be eligible for such a loan if—
<br>
<br>(i) the maximum tangible net worth of the applicant is not more than $15,000,000; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) of the applicant for the 2 full fiscal years before the date of the application is not more than $5,000,000.
<br>(6) Proposed rulemaking

<br>(7) Common size standards
<br>
<br>In carrying out this subsection, the Administrator may establish or approve a single size standard for a grouping of 4-digit North American Industry Classification System codes only if the Administrator makes publicly available, not later than the date on which such size standard is established or approved, a justification demonstrating that such size standard is appropriate for each individual industry classification included in the grouping.
<br>(8) Number of size standards
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall not limit the number of size standards established pursuant to paragraph (2), and shall assign the appropriate size standard to each North American Industry Classification System Code.
<br>(9) Petitions for reconsideration of size standards
<br>(A) In general

<br>The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall begin accepting petitions for reconsideration described in subparagraph (A) after the date on which the Administration issues a rule or other guidance implementing this paragraph.
