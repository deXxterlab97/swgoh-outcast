<br>"SEC. 3001. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This title may be cited as the 'Western Water Policy Review Act of 1992'.
<br>"SEC. 3002. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Nation needs an adequate water supply for all states [States] at a reasonable cost;
<br>
<br>"(2) the demands on the Nation's finite water supply are increasing;
<br>
<br>"(3) coordination on both the Federal level and the local level is needed to achieve water policy objectives;
<br>
<br>"(4) not less than fourteen agencies of the Federal Government are currently charged with functions relating to the oversight of water policy;
<br>
<br>"(5) the diverse authority over Federal water policy has resulted in unclear goals and an inefficient handling of the Nation's water policy;
<br>
<br>"(6) the conflict between competing goals and objectives by Federal, State, and local agencies as well as by private water users is particularly acute in the nineteen Western States which have arid climates which include the seventeen reclamation States, Hawaii, and Alaska;
<br>
<br>"(7) the appropriations doctrine of water allocation which characterizes most western water management regimes varies from State to State, and results in many instances in increased competition for limited resources;
<br>
<br>"(8) the Federal Government has recognized and continues to recognize the primary jurisdiction of the several States over the allocation, priority, and use of water resources of the States, except to the extent such jurisdiction has been preempted in whole or in part by the Federal Government, including, but not limited to, express or implied Federal reserved water rights either for itself or for the benefit of Indian Tribes, and that the Federal Government will, in exercising its authorities, comply with applicable State laws;
<br>
<br>"(9) the Federal Government recognizes its trust responsibilities to protect Indian water rights and assist Tribes in the wise use of those resources;
<br>
<br>"(10) Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, have had, and will continue to have major responsibilities in assisting States in the wise management and allocation of scarce water resources; and
<br>
<br>"(11) the Secretary of the Interior, given his responsibilities for management of public land, trust responsibilities for Indians, administration of the reclamation program, investigations and reviews into ground water resources through the Geologic Survey [now United States Geological Survey], and the Secretary of the Army, given his responsibilities for flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement, have the resources to assist in a comprehensive review, in consultation with appropriate officials from the nineteen Western States, into the problems and potential solutions facing the nineteen Western States and the Federal Government in the increasing competition for the scarce water resources of the Western States.
<br>"SEC. 3003. PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW.
<br>
<br>"(a) The President is directed to undertake a comprehensive review of Federal activities in the nineteen Western States which directly or indirectly affect the allocation and use of water resources, whether surface or subsurface, and to submit a report on the President's findings, together with recommendations, if any, to the Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works and Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on Natural Resources, Public Works and Transportation [now Transportation and Infrastructure], Merchant Marine and Fisheries and Appropriations of the House of Representatives.
<br>
<br>"(b) Such report shall be submitted within three years from the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 30, 1992].
<br>
<br>"(c) In conducting the review and preparing the report, the President is directed to consult with the Advisory Commission established under section 3004 of this title, and may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army or other Federal officials or the Commission to undertake such studies or other analyses as the President determines would assist in the review.
<br>
<br>"(d) The President shall consult periodically with the Commission, and upon the request of the President, the heads of other Federal agencies are directed to cooperate with and assist the Commission in its activities.
<br>"SEC. 3004. THE ADVISORY COMMISSION.
<br>
<br>"(a) The President shall appoint an Advisory Commission (hereafter in this title referred to as the 'Commission') to assist in the preparation and review of the report required under this title.
<br>
<br>"(b) The Commission shall be composed of eighteen members as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) Ten members appointed by the President including:
