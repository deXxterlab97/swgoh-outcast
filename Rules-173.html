<br>Note: As a result of the enactment of sections 602–604 of Public Law 105–85, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 [see Tables for classification], the Secretary of Defense now has the authority to adjust the rates of basic allowances for subsistence and housing. Therefore, these allowances are no longer adjusted by the President in conjunction with the adjustment of basic pay for members of the uniformed services. Accordingly, the tables of allowances included in previous orders are not included here.
