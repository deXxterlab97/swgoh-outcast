<br>In determining the amount of an award pursuant to subparagraph (A) for a State, the Secretary shall first determine an amount the Secretary considers appropriate for the State (referred to in this paragraph as the "base amount"), except that such amount may not be greater than the minimum amount determined under subparagraph (D).
<br>(C) Increase on basis of population
<br>
<br>After determining the base amount for a State under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall increase the base amount by an amount equal to the product of—
<br>

<br>(4) Certain political subdivisions

<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, before making awards pursuant to paragraph (3) for such year, reserve from the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for the year an amount determined necessary by the Secretary to make awards under subsection (a) to political subdivisions that have a substantial number of residents, have a substantial local infrastructure for responding to public health emergencies, and face a high degree of risk from bioterrorist attacks or other public health emergencies. Not more than three political subdivisions may receive awards pursuant to this subparagraph.

<br>
<br>In the case of a State that will receive an award pursuant to paragraph (3), and in which there is located a political subdivision that will receive an award pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, in determining the amount under paragraph (3)(C) for the State, subtract from the population of the State an amount equal to the population of such political subdivision.
<br>(D) Continuity of funding

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, before making awards pursuant to paragraph (3) for such year, reserve from the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for the year an amount determined necessary by the Secretary to make awards under subsection (a) to eligible entities that—
<br>
<br>(i) have a significant need for funds to build capacity to identify, detect, monitor, and respond to a bioterrorist or other threat to the public health, which need will not be met by awards pursuant to paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(ii) face a particularly high degree of risk of such a threat.
<br>(B) Recipients of grants
<br>
<br>Awards pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be supplemental awards to States that receive awards pursuant to paragraph (3), or may be awards to eligible entities described in subsection (b)(1)(B) within such States.
<br>(C) Finding with respect to District of Columbia
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consider the District of Columbia to have a significant unmet need for purposes of subparagraph (A), and to face a particularly high degree of risk for such purposes, on the basis of the concentration of entities of national significance located within the District.
<br>(6) Funding of local entities
<br>

<br>
<br>The Secretary may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, withhold payment of funds to any entity which is not using its allotment under this section or section 247d–3b of this title in accordance with such section. The Secretary may withhold such funds until the Secretary finds that the reason for the withholding has been removed and there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.
<br>(j) Compilation and availability of data
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall compile the data submitted under this section and make such data available in a timely manner on an appropriate Internet website in a format that is useful to the public and to other entities and that provides information on what activities are best contributing to the achievement of the outcome goals described in subsection (g).

<br>
<br>(A) a review of evidence-based benchmarks and objective standards, and associated metrics and targets;
<br>
<br>(B) a discussion of changes to any evidence-based benchmarks and objective standards, and the effect of such changes on the ability to track whether entities are meeting or making progress toward the goals under this section and, to the extent practicable, the applicable goals of the National Health Security Strategy under section 300hh–1 of this title;
