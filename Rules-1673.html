<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>Pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress to enact this part under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, it is the purpose of this part to protect the civil rights of victims of gender motivated violence and to promote public safety, health, and activities affecting interstate commerce by establishing a Federal civil rights cause of action for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.
<br>(b) Right to be free from crimes of violence
<br>
<br>All persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender (as defined in subsection (d)).
<br>(c) Cause of action
<br>
<br>A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.
<br>(d) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "crime of violence motivated by gender" means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender; and
<br>
<br>(2) the term "crime of violence" means— 1
<br>
<br>(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.
<br>(e) Limitation and procedures
<br>(1) Limitation
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender (within the meaning of subsection (d)).
<br>(2) No prior criminal action
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c).
<br>(3) Concurrent jurisdiction
<br>
<br>The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.
<br>(4) Supplemental jurisdiction
<br>
<br>Neither section 1367 of title 28 nor subsection (c) of this section shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.

Any test result of the defendant given to the victim or the defendant must be accompanied by appropriate counseling.
<br>(2) Showing required
<br>
<br>To obtain an order under paragraph (1), the victim must demonstrate that—

<br>(A) the defendant has been charged with the offense in a State or Federal court, and if the defendant has been arrested without a warrant, a probable cause determination has been made;
<br>
<br>(B) the test for the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome is requested by the victim after appropriate counseling; and
<br>

<br>(3) Follow-up testing

<br>An order for follow-up testing under paragraph (3) shall be terminated if the person obtains an acquittal on, or dismissal of, all charges of the type referred to in subsection (a).1
<br>(5) Confidentiality of test
<br>
<br>The results of any test ordered under this subsection shall be disclosed only to the victim or, where the court deems appropriate, to the parent or legal guardian of the victim, and to the person tested. The victim may disclose the test results only to any medical professional, counselor, family member or sexual partner(s) the victim may have had since the attack. Any such individual to whom the test results are disclosed by the victim shall maintain the confidentiality of such information.
<br>(6) Disclosure of test results
<br>
