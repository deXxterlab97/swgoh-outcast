<br>SUBCHAPTER IV—NATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES
<br>§1450. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The Federal Government has an ongoing obligation to support activities that contribute to positive results for children with disabilities, enabling those children to lead productive and independent adult lives.
<br>
<br>(2) Systemic change benefiting all students, including children with disabilities, requires the involvement of States, local educational agencies, parents, individuals with disabilities and their families, teachers and other service providers, and other interested individuals and organizations to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that improve educational results for children with disabilities.
<br>
<br>(3) State educational agencies, in partnership with local educational agencies, parents of children with disabilities, and other individuals and organizations, are in the best position to improve education for children with disabilities and to address their special needs.
<br>
<br>(4) An effective educational system serving students with disabilities should—
<br>
<br>(A) maintain high academic achievement standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities, consistent with the standards and expectations for all students in the educational system, and provide for appropriate and effective strategies and methods to ensure that all children with disabilities have the opportunity to achieve those standards and goals;
<br>
<br>(B) clearly define, in objective, measurable terms, the school and post-school results that children with disabilities are expected to achieve; and
<br>
<br>(C) promote transition services and coordinate State and local education, social, health, mental health, and other services, in addressing the full range of student needs, particularly the needs of children with disabilities who need significant levels of support to participate and learn in school and the community.
<br>
<br>(5) The availability of an adequate number of qualified personnel is critical—
<br>
<br>(A) to serve effectively children with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(B) to assume leadership positions in administration and direct services;
<br>
<br>(C) to provide teacher training; and
<br>
<br>(D) to conduct high quality research to improve special education.
<br>
<br>(6) High quality, comprehensive professional development programs are essential to ensure that the persons responsible for the education or transition of children with disabilities possess the skills and knowledge necessary to address the educational and related needs of those children.
<br>
<br>(7) Models of professional development should be scientifically based and reflect successful practices, including strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining personnel.
<br>
<br>(8) Continued support is essential for the development and maintenance of a coordinated and high quality program of research to inform successful teaching practices and model curricula for educating children with disabilities.
<br>
<br>(9) Training, technical assistance, support, and dissemination activities are necessary to ensure that subchapters II and III are fully implemented and achieve high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities and their families.
<br>
<br>(10) Parents, teachers, administrators, and related services personnel need technical assistance and information in a timely, coordinated, and accessible manner in order to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results at the State and local levels for children with disabilities and their families.
<br>
<br>(11) Parent training and information activities assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of parenting such a child and are of particular importance in—
<br>
<br>(A) playing a vital role in creating and preserving constructive relationships between parents of children with disabilities and schools by facilitating open communication between the parents and schools; encouraging dispute resolution at the earliest possible point in time; and discouraging the escalation of an adversarial process between the parents and schools;
<br>
<br>(B) ensuring the involvement of parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;
<br>
<br>(C) achieving high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(D) providing such parents information on their rights, protections, and responsibilities under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(E) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1473(b)(6) of this title;
<br>
<br>(F) supporting the roles of such parents as participants within partnerships seeking to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families; and
<br>
<br>(G) supporting such parents who may have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers.
<br>
<br>(12) Support is needed to improve technological resources and integrate technology, including universally designed technologies, into the lives of children with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, school personnel, and others through curricula, services, and assistive technologies.
