<br>§2901. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Weather and climate change affect food production, energy use, land use, water resources and other factors vital to national security and human welfare.
<br>
<br>(2) An ability to anticipate natural and man-induced changes in climate would contribute to the soundness of policy decisions in the public and private sectors.
<br>
<br>(3) Significant improvements in the ability to forecast climate on an intermediate and long-term basis are possible.
<br>
<br>(4) Information regarding climate is not being fully disseminated or used, and Federal efforts have given insufficient attention to assessing and applying this information.
<br>
<br>(5) Climate fluctuation and change occur on a global basis, and deficiencies exist in the system for monitoring global climate changes. International cooperation for the purpose of sharing the benefits and costs of a global effort to understand climate is essential.
<br>
<br>(6) The United States lacks a well-defined and coordinated program in climate-related research, monitoring, assessment of effects, and information utilization.

<br>"SEC. 1101. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This title [this note] may be cited as the 'Global Climate Protection Act of 1987'.
<br>"SEC. 1102. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) There exists evidence that manmade pollution—the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere—may be producing a long-term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth, a phenomenon known as global warming through the greenhouse effect.
<br>
<br>"(2) By early in the next century, an increase in Earth temperature could—
<br>
<br>"(A) so alter global weather patterns as to have an effect on existing agricultural production and on the habitability of large portions of the Earth; and
<br>
<br>"(B) cause thermal expansion of the oceans and partial melting of the polar ice caps and glaciers, resulting in rising sea levels.
<br>
<br>"(3) Important research into the problem of climate change is now being conducted by various United States Government and international agencies, and the continuation and intensification of those efforts will be crucial to the development of an effective United States response.
<br>
<br>"(4) While the consequences of the greenhouse effect may not be fully manifest until the next century, ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process. Necessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.
<br>
<br>"(5) The global nature of this problem will require vigorous efforts to achieve international cooperation aimed at minimizing and responding to adverse climate change; such international cooperation will be greatly enhanced by United States leadership. A key step in international cooperation will be the meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program, scheduled for June 1989, which will seek to determine a direction for worldwide efforts to control global climate change.
<br>
<br>"(6) Effective United States leadership in the international arena will depend upon a coordinated national policy.
<br>"SEC. 1103. MANDATE FOR ACTION ON THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.
<br>
<br>"(a) Goals of United States Policy.—United States policy should seek to—
<br>
<br>"(1) increase worldwide understanding of the greenhouse effect and its environmental and health consequences;
<br>
<br>"(2) foster cooperation among nations to develop more extensive and coordinated scientific research efforts with respect to the greenhouse effect;
<br>
<br>"(3) identify technologies and activities to limit mankind's adverse effect on the global climate by—
<br>
<br>"(A) slowing the rate of increase of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the near term; and
<br>
<br>"(B) stabilizing or reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases over the long term; and
<br>
<br>"(4) work toward multilateral agreements.
<br>
<br>"(b) Formulation of United States Policy.—The President, through the Environmental Protection Agency, shall be responsible for developing and proposing to Congress a coordinated national policy on global climate change. Such policy formulation shall consider research findings of the Committee on Earth Sciences of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Engineering Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other organizations engaged in the conduct of scientific research.
<br>
<br>"(c) Coordination of United States Policy in the International Arena.—The Secretary of State shall be responsible to coordinate those aspects of United States policy requiring action through the channels of multilateral diplomacy, including the United Nations Environment Program and other international organizations. In the formulation of these elements of United States policy, the Secretary of State shall, under the direction of the President, work jointly with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and other United States agencies concerned with environmental protection, consistent with applicable Federal law.
<br>"SEC. 1104. REPORT TO CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 1987], the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall jointly submit to all committees of jurisdiction in the Congress a report which shall include—
<br>
<br>"(1) a summary analysis of current international scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect, including its environmental and health consequences;
<br>
<br>"(2) an assessment of United States efforts to gain international cooperation in limiting global climate change; and
<br>
<br>"(3) a description of the strategy by which the United States intends to seek further international cooperation to limit global climate change.
<br>"SEC. 1105. INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF GLOBAL CLIMATE PROTECTION.
<br>
<br>"In order to focus international attention and concern on the problem of global warming, and to foster further work on multilateral treaties aimed at protecting the global climate, the Secretary of State shall undertake all necessary steps to promote, within the United Nations system, the early designation of an International Year of Global Climate Protection.
<br>"SEC. 1106. CLIMATE PROTECTION AND UNITED STATES RELATIONS WITH THE INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.
<br>
<br>"In recognition of the respective leadership roles of the United States and the independent states of the former Soviet Union in the international arena, and of the extent to which they are producers of atmospheric pollutants, the Congress urges that the President accord the problem of climate protection a high priority on the agenda of United States relations with the independent states."

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—UNITED STATES GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM
<br>§2931. Findings and purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Industrial, agricultural, and other human activities, coupled with an expanding world population, are contributing to processes of global change that may significantly alter the Earth habitat within a few human generations.
<br>
<br>(2) Such human-induced changes, in conjunction with natural fluctuations, may lead to significant global warming and thus alter world climate patterns and increase global sea levels. Over the next century, these consequences could adversely affect world agricultural and marine production, coastal habitability, biological diversity, human health, and global economic and social well-being.
<br>
<br>(3) The release of chlorofluorocarbons and other stratospheric ozone-depleting substances is rapidly reducing the ability of the atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which could adversely affect human health and ecological systems.
<br>
<br>(4) Development of effective policies to abate, mitigate, and cope with global change will rely on greatly improved scientific understanding of global environmental processes and on our ability to distinguish human-induced from natural global change.
<br>
<br>(5) New developments in interdisciplinary Earth sciences, global observing systems, and computing technology make possible significant advances in the scientific understanding and prediction of these global changes and their effects.
<br>
<br>(6) Although significant Federal global change research efforts are underway, an effective Federal research program will require efficient interagency coordination, and coordination with the research activities of State, private, and international entities.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for development and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.

<br>(B) if there are no currently operating tracks within 60 miles then the closest currently operating track in an adjoining State.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, any off-track betting office in a State with at least 250 days of on-track parimutuel horseracing a year, may accept interstate off-track wagers for a total of 60 racing days and 25 special events a year without the approval required by paragraph (1), if with respect to such 60 racing days, there is no racing of the same type at the same time of day being conducted within the off-track betting State within 60 miles of the off-track betting office accepting the wager, or such racing program cannot be completed. Excluded from such 60 days and from the consent required by subsection (b)(1) may be dark days which occur during a regularly scheduled race meeting in said off-track betting State. In order to accept any interstate off-track wager under the terms of the preceding sentence the off-track betting office shall make identical offers to any racing association described in subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(1). Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to reduce or eliminate the necessity of obtaining all the approvals required by subsection (a).
<br>(c) Takeout amount
<br>
<br>No parimutuel off-track betting system may employ a takeout for an interstate wager which is greater than the takeout for corresponding wagering pools of off-track wagers on races run within the off-track State except where such greater takeout is authorized by State law in the off-track State.

<br>§3005. Liability and damages
<br>
<br>Any person accepting any interstate off-track wager in violation of this chapter shall be civilly liable for damages to the host State, the host racing association and the horsemen's group. Damages for each violation shall be based on the total of off-track wagers as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) If the interstate off-track wager was of a type accepted at the host racing association, damages shall be in an amount equal to that portion of the takeout which would have been distributed to the host State, host racing association and the horsemen's group, as if each such interstate off-track wager had been placed at the host racing association.
<br>
<br>(2) If such interstate off-track wager was of a type not accepted at the host racing association, the amount of damages shall be determined at the rate of takeout prevailing at the off-track betting system for that type of wager and shall be distributed according to the same formulas as in paragraph (1) above.
