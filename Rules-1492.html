<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "clauses".
<br>
<br>2 So in original. There are two pars. designated (4) and no par. (3).
<br>§1056. Form and payment of benefits
<br>(a) Commencement date for payment of benefits
<br>
<br>Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which—
<br>
<br>(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,
<br>
<br>(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or
<br>
<br>(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or
<br>
<br>(2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,
<br>
<br>a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.
<br>(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions
<br>
<br>No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.
<br>(d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits
<br>
<br>(1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) the term "qualified domestic relations order" means a domestic relations order—
<br>
<br>(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and
<br>
<br>(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the term "domestic relations order" means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which—
<br>
<br>(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and
<br>
<br>(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).
<br>
<br>(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies—
<br>
<br>(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,
<br>
<br>(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and
<br>
<br>(iv) each plan to which such order applies.
<br>
<br>(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order—
<br>
<br>(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,
<br>
<br>(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and
<br>
<br>(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
<br>
<br>(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee—
<br>
<br>(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,
<br>
<br>(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and
<br>
<br>(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).
<br>
<br>For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "earliest retirement age" means the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or
<br>
<br>(II) the later of the date of 1 the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.
<br>
<br>(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order—
<br>
<br>(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and
<br>
<br>(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.
<br>
<br>(G)(i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan—
<br>
<br>(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and
<br>
<br>(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.
<br>
<br>(ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures—
<br>
<br>(I) shall be in writing,
<br>
<br>(II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and
<br>
<br>(III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.
<br>
<br>(H)(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the "segregated amounts") which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
<br>
<br>(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.
<br>
<br>(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)—
<br>
<br>(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or
<br>
<br>(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,
<br>
<br>then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.
<br>
<br>(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.
<br>
<br>(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.
<br>
<br>(I) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in—
<br>
<br>(i) treating a domestic relations order as being (or not being) a qualified domestic relations order, or
<br>
<br>(ii) taking action under subparagraph (H),
<br>
<br>then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.
<br>
<br>(J) A person who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this chapter a beneficiary under the plan. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall permit a requirement under section 1301 of this title of the payment of more than 1 premium with respect to a participant for any period.
<br>
<br>(K) The term "alternate payee" means any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.
<br>
<br>(L) This paragraph shall not apply to any plan to which paragraph (1) does not apply.
<br>
<br>(M) Payment of benefits by a pension plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of a qualified domestic relations order shall not be treated as garnishment for purposes of section 1673(a) of title 15.
<br>
<br>(N) In prescribing regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any offset of a participant's benefits provided under an employee pension benefit plan against an amount that the participant is ordered or required to pay to the plan if—
<br>
<br>(A) the order or requirement to pay arises—
<br>
<br>(i) under a judgment of conviction for a crime involving such plan,
<br>
<br>(ii) under a civil judgment (including a consent order or decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle, or
<br>
<br>(iii) pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary and the participant, or a settlement agreement between the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person,
<br>
<br>(B) the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the plan against the participant's benefits provided under the plan, and
<br>
<br>(C) in a case in which the survivor annuity requirements of section 1055 of this title apply with respect to distributions from the plan to the participant, if the participant has a spouse at the time at which the offset is to be made—
<br>

<br>(4) Limitation on benefit accruals for plans with severe funding shortfalls
<br>(A) In general

<br>(5) Rules relating to contributions required to avoid benefit limitations
<br>(A) Security may be provided
<br>(i) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(I) a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title,
<br>
<br>(II) cash, or United States obligations which mature in 3 years or less, held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution, or
<br>
<br>(III) such other form of security as is satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury and the parties involved.
<br>(iii) Enforcement
<br>
<br>Any security provided under clause (i) may be perfected and enforced at any time after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(I) the date on which the plan terminates,
<br>
<br>(II) if there is a failure to make a payment of the minimum required contribution for any plan year beginning after the security is provided, the due date for the payment under section 1083(j) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(III) if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is less than 60 percent for a consecutive period of 7 years, the valuation date for the last year in the period.
<br>(iv) Release of security
<br>
<br>The security shall be released (and any amounts thereunder shall be refunded together with any interest accrued thereon) at such time as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe in regulations, including regulations for partial releases of the security by reason of increases in the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
<br>(B) Prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance may not be used
<br>
<br>No prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section 1083(f) of this title may be used under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) to satisfy any payment an employer may make under any such paragraph to avoid or terminate the application of any limitation under such paragraph.
<br>(C) Deemed reduction of funding balances
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clause (iii), in any case in which a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) would (but for this subparagraph and determined without regard to paragraph (1)(B), (2)(B), or (4)(B)) apply to such plan for the plan year, the plan sponsor of such plan shall be treated for purposes of this chapter as having made an election under section 1083(f) of this title to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance by such amount as is necessary for such benefit limitation to not apply to the plan for such plan year.
<br>(ii) Exception for insufficient funding balances
<br>
<br>Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to a benefit limitation for any plan year if the application of clause (i) would not result in the benefit limitation not applying for such plan year.
<br>(iii) Restrictions of certain rules to collectively bargained plans
<br>
<br>With respect to any benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), or (4), clause (i) shall only apply in the case of a plan maintained pursuant to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and 1 or more employers.
<br>(6) New plans
<br>
<br>Paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) shall not apply to a plan for the first 5 plan years of the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, the reference in this paragraph to a plan shall include a reference to any predecessor plan.
<br>(7) Presumed underfunding for purposes of benefit limitations
<br>(A) Presumption of continued underfunding
<br>
<br>In any case in which a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) has been applied to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year shall be presumed to be equal to the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the preceding plan year until the enrolled actuary of the plan certifies the actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year.
<br>(B) Presumption of underfunding after 10th month
<br>
<br>In any case in which no certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year is made with respect to the plan before the first day of the 10th month of such year, for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), such first day shall be deemed, for purposes of such paragraph, to be the valuation date of the plan for the current plan year and the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage shall be conclusively presumed to be less than 60 percent as of such first day.
<br>(C) Presumption of underfunding after 4th month for nearly underfunded plans
<br>
<br>In any case in which—
<br>
<br>(i) a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) did not apply to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, but the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for such preceding plan year was not more than 10 percentage points greater than the percentage which would have caused such paragraph to apply to the plan with respect to such preceding plan year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) as of the first day of the 4th month of the current plan year, the enrolled actuary of the plan has not certified the actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year,
<br>
<br>until the enrolled actuary so certifies, such first day shall be deemed, for purposes of such paragraph, to be the valuation date of the plan for the current plan year and the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan as of such first day shall, for purposes of such paragraph, be presumed to be equal to 10 percentage points less than the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for such preceding plan year.
<br>(8) Treatment of plan as of close of prohibited or cessation period
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying this part—
<br>(A) Operation of plan after period
<br>
<br>Unless the plan provides otherwise, payments and accruals will resume effective as of the day following the close of the period for which any limitation of payment or accrual of benefits under paragraph (3) or (4) applies.
<br>(B) Treatment of affected benefits
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the plan's treatment of benefits which would have been paid or accrued but for this subsection.
<br>(9) Terms relating to funding target attainment percentage
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "funding target attainment percentage" has the same meaning given such term by section 1083(d)(2) of this title.
<br>(B) Adjusted funding target attainment percentage
<br>
<br>The term "adjusted funding target attainment percentage" means the funding target attainment percentage which is determined under subparagraph (A) by increasing each of the amounts under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1083(d)(2) of this title by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for employees other than highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q) of title 26) which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years.
<br>(C) Application to plans which are fully funded without regard to reductions for funding balances
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan for any plan year, if the funding target attainment percentage is 100 percent or more (determined without regard to the reduction in the value of assets under section 1083(f)(4) of this title), the funding target attainment percentage for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be determined without regard to such reduction.
<br>(10) Secretarial authority for plans with alternate valuation date
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan which has designated a valuation date other than the first day of the plan year, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules for the application of this subsection which are necessary to reflect the alternate valuation date.

<br>(e) Special rules for eligible combined defined benefit plans and qualified cash or deferred arrangements
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this subsection, this chapter shall be applied to any defined benefit plan or applicable individual account plan which are 1 part of an eligible combined plan in the same manner as if each such plan were not a part of the eligible combined plan. In the case of a termination of the defined benefit plan and the applicable defined contribution plan forming part of an eligible combined plan, the plan administrator shall terminate each such plan separately.
<br>(2) Eligible combined plan
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "eligible combined plan" means a plan—
<br>
<br>(i) which is maintained by an employer which, at the time the plan is established, is a small employer,
<br>
<br>(ii) which consists of a defined benefit plan and an applicable individual account plan each of which qualifies under section 401(a) of title 26,
<br>
<br>(iii) the assets of which are held in a single trust forming part of the plan and are clearly identified and allocated to the defined benefit plan and the applicable individual account plan to the extent necessary for the separate application of this chapter under paragraph (1), and
<br>
<br>(iv) with respect to which the benefit, contribution, vesting, and nondiscrimination requirements of subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) are met.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "small employer" has the meaning given such term by section 4980D(d)(2) of title 26, except that such section shall be applied by substituting "500" for "50" each place it appears.
<br>(B) Benefit requirements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The benefit requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to the defined benefit plan forming part of the eligible combined plan if the accrued benefit of each participant derived from employer contributions, when expressed as an annual retirement benefit, is not less than the applicable percentage of the participant's final average pay. For purposes of this clause, final average pay shall be determined using the period of consecutive years (not exceeding 5) during which the participant had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer.
<br>(ii) Applicable percentage
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage is the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(I) 1 percent multiplied by the number of years of service with the employer, or
<br>
<br>(II) 20 percent.
<br>(iii) Special rule for applicable defined benefit plans
<br>
<br>If the defined benefit plan under clause (i) is an applicable defined benefit plan as defined in section 1053(f)(3)(B) of this title which meets the interest credit requirements of section 1054(b)(5)(B)(i) of this title, the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) with respect to any plan year if each participant receives pay credit for the year which is not less than the percentage of compensation determined in accordance with the following table:
<br>    If the participant's age as of the
<br>
<br>   beginning of the year is—
<br>	The percentage is—
<br>30 or less 	2  
<br>Over 30 but less than 40 	4  
<br>40 or over but less than 50 	6  
<br>50 or over 	8.
<br>(iv) Years of service
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, years of service shall be determined under the rules of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 1053(b) of this title, except that the plan may not disregard any year of service because of a participant making, or failing to make, any elective deferral with respect to the qualified cash or deferred arrangement to which subparagraph (C) applies.
<br>(C) Contribution requirements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The contribution requirements of this subparagraph with respect to any applicable individual account plan forming part of an eligible combined plan are met if—
<br>
<br>(I) the qualified cash or deferred arrangement included in such plan constitutes an automatic contribution arrangement, and
<br>
<br>(II) the employer is required to make matching contributions on behalf of each employee eligible to participate in the arrangement in an amount equal to 50 percent of the elective contributions of the employee to the extent such elective contributions do not exceed 4 percent of compensation.
<br>
<br> Rules similar to the rules of clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 401(k)(12)(B) of title 26 shall apply for purposes of this clause.
<br>(ii) Nonelective contributions
<br>
<br>An applicable individual account plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) because the employer makes nonelective contributions under the plan but such contributions shall not be taken into account in determining whether the requirements of clause (i)(II) are met.
<br>(D) Vesting requirements
<br>
<br>The vesting requirements of this subparagraph are met if—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a defined benefit plan forming part of an eligible combined plan an employee who has completed at least 3 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued benefit under the plan derived from employer contributions, and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of an applicable individual account plan forming part of eligible combined plan—
<br>
<br>(I) an employee has a nonforfeitable right to any matching contribution made under the qualified cash or deferred arrangement included in such plan by an employer with respect to any elective contribution, including matching contributions in excess of the contributions required under subparagraph (C)(i)(II), and
<br>
<br>(II) an employee who has completed at least 3 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued benefit derived under the arrangement from nonelective contributions of the employer.
<br>
<br> For purposes of this subparagraph, the rules of section 1053 of this title shall apply to the extent not inconsistent with this subparagraph.
<br>(E) Uniform provision of contributions and benefits
<br>
<br>In the case of a defined benefit plan or applicable individual account plan forming part of an eligible combined plan, the requirements of this subparagraph are met if all contributions and benefits under each such plan, and all rights and features under each such plan, must be provided uniformly to all participants.
<br>(F) Requirements must be met without taking into account social security and similar contributions and benefits or other plans
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) are met.
<br>(ii) Social security and similar contributions
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met if—
<br>
<br>(I) the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) are met without regard to section 401(l) of title 26, and
<br>
<br>(II) the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) of title 26 are met with respect to both the applicable defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan forming part of an eligible combined plan without regard to section 401(l) of title 26.
<br>(iii) Other plans and arrangements
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met if the applicable defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan forming part of an eligible combined plan meet the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) of title 26 without being combined with any other plan.
<br>(3) Automatic contribution arrangement
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A qualified cash or deferred arrangement shall be treated as an automatic contribution arrangement if the arrangement—
<br>
<br>(i) provides that each employee eligible to participate in the arrangement is treated as having elected to have the employer make elective contributions in an amount equal to 4 percent of the employee's compensation unless the employee specifically elects not to have such contributions made or to have such contributions made at a different rate, and
<br>
<br>(ii) meets the notice requirements under subparagraph (B).
<br>(B) Notice requirements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) are met.
<br>(ii) Reasonable period to make election
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met if each employee to whom subparagraph (A)(i) applies—
<br>
<br>(I) receives a notice explaining the employee's right under the arrangement to elect not to have elective contributions made on the employee's behalf or to have the contributions made at a different rate, and
<br>
<br>(II) has a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice and before the first elective contribution is made to make such election.
<br>(iii) Annual notice of rights and obligations
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met if each employee eligible to participate in the arrangement is, within a reasonable period before any year, given notice of the employee's rights and obligations under the arrangement.
<br>
<br>The requirements of this subparagraph shall not be treated as met unless the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of section 401(k)(12)(D) of title 26 are met with respect to the notices described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph.
<br>(4) Coordination with other requirements
