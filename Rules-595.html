<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER VI—ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS
<br>§1693. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Rights and liabilities undefined
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that the use of electronic systems to transfer funds provides the potential for substantial benefits to consumers. However, due to the unique characteristics of such systems, the application of existing consumer protection legislation is unclear, leaving the rights and liabilities of consumers, financial institutions, and intermediaries in electronic fund transfers undefined.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund and remittance transfer systems. The primary objective of this subchapter, however, is the provision of individual consumer rights.

<br>
<br>(B) to carry out the purposes of section 1693o–2 of this title.
<br>
<br>In prescribing such regulations, the Board shall:
<br>
<br>(1) 1 consult with the other agencies referred to in section 1693o 2 of this title and take into account, and allow for, the continuing evolution of electronic banking services and the technology utilized in such services,
<br>
<br>(2) 1 prepare an analysis of economic impact which considers the costs and benefits to financial institutions, consumers, and other users of electronic fund transfers, including the extent to which additional documentation, reports, records, or other paper work would be required, and the effects upon competition in the provision of electronic banking services among large and small financial institutions and the availability of such services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers,
<br>
<br>(3) 1 to the extent practicable, the Board shall demonstrate that the consumer protections of the proposed regulations outweigh the compliance costs imposed upon consumers and financial institutions, and
<br>
<br>(4) 1 any proposed regulations and accompanying analyses shall be sent promptly to Congress by the Board.
<br>(b) Issuance of model clauses
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall issue model clauses for optional use by financial institutions to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of section 1693c of this title and to aid consumers in understanding the rights and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfers by utilizing readily understandable language. Such model clauses shall be adopted after notice duly given in the Federal Register and opportunity for public comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5. With respect to the disclosures required by section 1693c(a)(3) and (4) of this title, the Bureau shall take account of variations in the services and charges under different electronic fund transfer systems and, as appropriate, shall issue alternative model clauses for disclosure of these differing account terms.
<br>(c) Criteria; modification of requirements
<br>
<br>Regulations prescribed hereunder may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of electronic fund transfers or remittance transfers, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith. The Bureau shall by regulation modify the requirements imposed by this subchapter on small financial institutions if the Bureau determines that such modifications are necessary to alleviate any undue compliance burden on small financial institutions and such modifications are consistent with the purpose and objective of this subchapter.
<br>(d) Applicability to service providers other than certain financial institutions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If electronic fund transfer services are made available to consumers by a person other than a financial institution holding a consumer's account, the Bureau shall by regulation assure that the disclosures, protections, responsibilities, and remedies created by this subchapter are made applicable to such persons and services.

<br>(C) Exception for direct deposit into recipient's account
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (B) shall not apply with respect to any electronic funds transfer under an electronic benefit transfer system for a deposit directly into a consumer account held by the recipient of the benefit.
<br>(D) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>No provision of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) affects or alters the protections otherwise applicable with respect to benefits established by any other provision 3 Federal, State, or local law; or
<br>
<br>(ii) otherwise supersedes the application of any State or local law.
<br>(3) Fee disclosures at automated teller machines
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall require any automated teller machine operator who imposes a fee on any consumer for providing host transfer services to such consumer to provide notice in accordance with subparagraph (B) to the consumer (at the time the service is provided) of—
<br>
<br>(i) the fact that a fee is imposed by such operator for providing the service; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of any such fee.

<br>(C) Prohibition on fees not properly disclosed and explicitly assumed by consumer
<br>
<br>No fee may be imposed by any automated teller machine operator in connection with any electronic fund transfer initiated by a consumer for which a notice is required under subparagraph (A), unless—

<br>
<br>The term "automated teller machine operator" means any person who—

<br>
<br>(4) any charges for electronic fund transfers or for the right to make such transfers;
<br>
<br>(5) the consumer's right to stop payment of a preauthorized electronic fund transfer and the procedure to initiate such a stop payment order;
<br>
<br>(6) the consumer's right to receive documentation of electronic fund transfers under section 1693d of this title;
<br>

<br>§1693f. Error resolution
<br>(a) Notification to financial institution of error
<br>
<br>If a financial institution, within sixty days after having transmitted to a consumer documentation pursuant to section 1693d(a), (c), or (d) of this title or notification pursuant to section 1693d(b) of this title, receives oral or written notice in which the consumer—
<br>
<br>(1) sets forth or otherwise enables the financial institution to identify the name and account number of the consumer;
<br>
<br>(2) indicates the consumer's belief that the documentation, or, in the case of notification pursuant to section 1693d(b) of this title, the consumer's account, contains an error and the amount of such error; and
<br>
<br>(3) sets forth the reasons for the consumer's belief (where applicable) that an error has occurred,
<br>
<br>the financial institution shall investigate the alleged error, determine whether an error has occurred, and report or mail the results of such investigation and determination to the consumer within ten business days. The financial institution may require written confirmation to be provided to it within ten business days of an oral notification of error if, when the oral notification is made, the consumer is advised of such requirement and the address to which such confirmation should be sent. A financial institution which requires written confirmation in accordance with the previous sentence need not provisionally recredit a consumer's account in accordance with subsection (c), nor shall the financial institution be liable under subsection (e) if the written confirmation is not received within the ten-day period referred to in the previous sentence.
<br>(b) Correction of error; interest
<br>
<br>If the financial institution determines that an error did occur, it shall promptly, but in no event more than one business day after such determination, correct the error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including the crediting of interest where applicable.
<br>(c) Provisional recredit of consumer's account
<br>
<br>If a financial institution receives notice of an error in the manner and within the time period specified in subsection (a), it may, in lieu of the requirements of subsections (a) and (b), within ten business days after receiving such notice provisionally recredit the consumer's account for the amount alleged to be in error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including interest where applicable, pending the conclusion of its investigation and its determination of whether an error has occurred. Such investigation shall be concluded not later than forty-five days after receipt of notice of the error. During the pendency of the investigation, the consumer shall have full use of the funds provisionally recredited.
<br>(d) Absence of error; finding; explanation
<br>
<br>If the financial institution determines after its investigation pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) that an error did not occur, it shall deliver or mail to the consumer an explanation of its findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of its investigation, and upon request of the consumer promptly deliver or mail to the consumer reproductions of all documents which the financial institution relied on to conclude that such error did not occur. The financial institution shall include notice of the right to request reproductions with the explanation of its findings.
<br>(e) Treble damages
<br>
<br>If in any action under section 1693m 1 of this title, the court finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the financial institution did not provisionally recredit a consumer's account within the ten-day period specified in subsection (c), and the financial institution (A) did not make a good faith investigation of the alleged error, or (B) did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the consumer's account was not in error; or
<br>
<br>(2) the financial institution knowingly and willfully concluded that the consumer's account was not in error when such conclusion could not reasonably have been drawn from the evidence available to the financial institution at the time of its investigation,
<br>
<br>then the consumer shall be entitled to treble damages determined under section 1693m(a)(1) 1 of this title.
<br>(f) Acts constituting error
<br>
<br>For the purpose of this section, an error consists of—
<br>
<br>(1) an unauthorized electronic fund transfer;
<br>
<br>(2) an incorrect electronic fund transfer from or to the consumer's account;
<br>
<br>(3) the omission from a periodic statement of an electronic fund transfer affecting the consumer's account which should have been included;
<br>
<br>(4) a computational error by the financial institution;
<br>
<br>(5) the consumer's receipt of an incorrect amount of money from an electronic terminal;
<br>
<br>(6) a consumer's request for additional information or clarification concerning an electronic fund transfer or any documentation required by this subchapter; or
<br>
<br>(7) any other error described in regulations of the Bureau.

<br>§1693g. Consumer liability
<br>(a) Unauthorized electronic fund transfers; limit
<br>
<br>A consumer shall be liable for any unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the account of such consumer only if the card or other means of access utilized for such transfer was an accepted card or other meanas 1 of access and if the issuer of such card, code, or other means of access has provided a means whereby the user of such card, code, or other means of access can be identified as the person authorized to use it, such as by signature, photograph, or fingerprint or by electronic or mechanical confirmation. In no event, however, shall a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer exceed the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(1) $50; or
<br>
<br>(2) the amount of money or value of property or services obtained in such unauthorized electronic fund transfer prior to the time the financial institution is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of, circumstances which lead to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account has been or may be effected. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient when such steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the financial institution with the pertinent information, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the financial institution does in fact receive such information.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report within sixty days of transmittal of the statement (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a reasonable time under the circumstances) any unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error which appears on the periodic statement provided to the consumer under section 1693d of this title. In addition, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses which the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report any loss or theft of a card or other means of access within two business days after the consumer learns of the loss or theft (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a longer period which is reasonable under the circumstances), but the consumer's liability under this subsection in any such case may not exceed a total of $500, or the amount of unauthorized electronic fund transfers which occur following the close of two business days (or such longer period) after the consumer learns of the loss or theft but prior to notice to the financial institution under this subsection, whichever is less.
<br>(b) Burden of proof
<br>
<br>In any action which involves a consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the electronic fund transfer was authorized or, if the electronic fund transfer was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to establish that the conditions of liability set forth in subsection (a) have been met, and, if the transfer was initiated after the effective date of section 1693c of this title, that the disclosures required to be made to the consumer under section 1693c(a)(1) and (2) of this title were in fact made in accordance with such section.
<br>(c) Determination of limitation on liability
<br>
<br>In the event of a transaction which involves both an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and an extension of credit as defined in section 1602(e) 2 of this title pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn, the limitation on the consumer's liability for such transaction shall be determined solely in accordance with this section.
<br>(d) Restriction on liability
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a consumer for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer in excess of his liability for such a transfer under other applicable law or under any agreement with the consumer's financial institution.
<br>(e) Scope of liability
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this section, a consumer incurs no liability from an unauthorized electronic fund transfer.

<br>§1693h. Liability of financial institutions
<br>(a) Action or failure to act proximately causing damages
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (b) and (c), a financial institution shall be liable to a consumer for all damages proximately caused by—
<br>
<br>(1) the financial institution's failure to make an electronic fund transfer, in accordance with the terms and conditions of an account, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed to do so by the consumer, except where—
<br>
<br>(A) the consumer's account has insufficient funds;
<br>
<br>(B) the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer;
<br>
<br>(C) such transfer would exceed an established credit limit;
<br>
<br>(D) an electronic terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction; or
<br>
<br>(E) as otherwise provided in regulations of the Bureau;
<br>
<br>(2) the financial institution's failure to make an electronic fund transfer due to insufficient funds when the financal 1 institution failed to credit, in accordance with the terms and conditions of an account, a deposit of funds to the consumer's account which would have provided sufficient funds to make the transfer, and
<br>
<br>(3) the financial institution's failure to stop payment of a preauthorized transfer from a consumer's account when instructed to do so in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.
<br>(b) Acts of God and technical malfunctions
<br>
<br>A financial institution shall not be liable under subsection (a)(1) or (2) if the financial institution shows by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from—
<br>
<br>(1) an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control, that it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an occurrence, and that it exercised such diligence as the circumstances required; or
<br>
<br>(2) a technical malfunction which was known to the consumer at the time he attempted to initiate an electronic fund transfer or, in the case of a preauthorized transfer, at the time such transfer should have occurred.
<br>(c) Intent
<br>
<br>In the case of a failure described in subsection (a) which was not intentional and which resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error, the financial institution shall be liable for actual damages proved.
<br>(d) Exception for damaged notices
<br>
<br>If the notice required to be posted pursuant to section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title by an automated teller machine operator has been posted by such operator in compliance with such section and the notice is subsequently removed, damaged, or altered by any person other than the operator of the automated teller machine, the operator shall have no liability under this section for failure to comply with section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title.

<br>(4) such card, code, or other means of access is validated only in response to a request or application from the consumer, upon verification of the consumer's identity.

<br>§1693j. Suspension of obligations
<br>
<br>If a system malfunction prevents the effectuation of an electronic fund transfer initiated by a consumer to another person, and such other person has agreed to accept payment by such means, the consumer's obligation to the other person shall be suspended until the malfunction is corrected and the electronic fund transfer may be completed, unless such other person has subsequently, by written request, demanded payment by means other than an electronic fund transfer.
