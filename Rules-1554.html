The Federal Government performance plan shall—

<br>
<br>(b) Agency Performance Plans.—Not later than the first Monday in February of each year, the head of each agency shall make available on a public website of the agency, and notify the President and the Congress of its availability, a performance plan covering each program activity set forth in the budget of such agency. Such plan shall—
<br>
<br>(1) establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be achieved during the year in which the plan is submitted and the next fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(2) express such goals in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form unless authorized to be in an alternative form under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(3) describe how the performance goals contribute to—
<br>
<br>(A) the general goals and objectives established in the agency's strategic plan required by section 306(a)(2) of title 5; and
<br>
<br>(B) any of the Federal Government performance goals established in the Federal Government performance plan required by subsection (a)(1);
<br>
<br>(4) identify among the performance goals those which are designated as agency priority goals as required by section 1120(b) of this title, if applicable;
<br>

<br>
<br>(E) an identification of the agency officials responsible for the achievement of each performance goal, who shall be known as goal leaders;
<br>
<br>(6) establish a balanced set of performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing progress toward each performance goal, including, as appropriate, customer service, efficiency, output, and outcome indicators;
<br>
<br>(7) provide a basis for comparing actual program results with the established performance goals;
<br>
<br>(8) a description of how the agency will ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used to measure progress towards its performance goals, including an identification of—
<br>
<br>(A) the means to be used to verify and validate measured values;
<br>
<br>(B) the sources for the data;
<br>
<br>(C) the level of accuracy required for the intended use of the data;

<br>(c) Alternative Form.—If an agency, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, determines that it is not feasible to express the performance goals for a particular program activity in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may authorize an alternative form. Such alternative form shall—
<br>
<br>(1) include separate descriptive statements of—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) a minimally effective program; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a successful program; or
<br>
<br>(B) such alternative as authorized by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with sufficient precision and in such terms that would allow for an accurate, independent determination of whether the program activity's performance meets the criteria of the description; or
<br>
<br>(2) state why it is infeasible or impractical to express a performance goal in any form for the program activity.
<br>
<br>(d) Treatment of Program Activities.—For the purpose of complying with this section, an agency may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities, except that any aggregation or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity constituting a major function or operation for the agency.
<br>
<br>(e) Appendix.—An agency may submit with an annual performance plan an appendix covering any portion of the plan that—
<br>
<br>(1) is specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and
<br>
<br>(2) is properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.
<br>

<br>
<br>(g) Chief Human Capital Officers.—With respect to each agency with a Chief Human Capital Officer, the Chief Human Capital Officer shall prepare that portion of the annual performance plan described under subsection (b)(5)(A).
