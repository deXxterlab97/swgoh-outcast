<br>(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any term, quarter, or semester for which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled on a less than half-time basis and shall not be construed as restricting the Secretary from requiring that an educational institution, in reporting an enrollment for more than one term, quarter, or semester, specify the dates of any intervals within or between any such terms, quarters, or semesters.
<br>
<br>(4) A course offered by an educational institution that does not begin on the first day of an academic term, but does begin seven or fewer days after such day, shall be treated as beginning on such day for purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term "educational institution" may include a group, district, or consortium of separately accredited educational institutions located in the same State that are organized in a manner that facilitates the centralized reporting of the enrollments in such group, district, or consortium of institutions.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary, prior to making payment of a reporting fee to an educational institution, as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, shall require such institution to certify that it has exercised reasonable diligence in determining whether such institution or any course offered by such institution approved for the enrollment of veterans or eligible persons meets all of the applicable requirements of chapters 31, 34, 35, and 36 of this title and that it will, without delay, report any failure to meet any such requirement to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) The Secretary may pay to any educational institution, or to the sponsor of a program of apprenticeship, furnishing education or training under either this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title, a reporting fee which will be in lieu of any other compensation or reimbursement for reports or certifications which such educational institution or sponsor of a program of apprenticeship is required to submit to the Secretary by law or regulation.
<br>
<br>(2) Such reporting fee shall be computed for each calendar year by multiplying $16 1 by the number of eligible veterans or eligible persons enrolled under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title. The reporting fee shall be paid to such educational institution or sponsor of a program of apprenticeship as soon as feasible after the end of the calendar year for which it is applicable.
<br>
<br>(3) No reporting fee payable to an educational institution under this subsection shall be subject to offset by the Secretary against any liability of such institution for any overpayment for which such institution may be administratively determined to be liable under section 3685 of this title unless such liability is not contested by such institution or has been upheld by a final decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>(4) Any reporting fee paid to an educational institution or sponsor of a program of apprenticeship after the date of the enactment of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2011 (Public Law 111–377)—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be utilized by such institution or sponsor solely for the making of certifications required under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title or for otherwise supporting programs for veterans; and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to an institution that has 100 or more enrollees described in paragraph (2) may not be used for or merged with amounts available for the general fund of the educational institution or sponsor of a program of apprenticeship.
<br>
<br>(5) The reporting fee payable under this subsection shall be paid from amounts appropriated for readjustment benefits.
<br>
<br>(d) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall ensure that the Department provides personnel of educational institutions who are charged with submitting reports or certifications to the Secretary under this section with assistance in preparing and submitting such reports or certifications.

<br>§3686. Correspondence courses
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Each eligible veteran (as defined in section 3452(a)(1) and (2) of this title) and each eligible spouse or surviving spouse (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) who enters into an enrollment agreement to pursue a program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be paid an educational assistance allowance computed at the rate of 55 percent of the established charge which the institution requires nonveterans to pay for the course or courses pursued by the eligible veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. The term "established charge" as used herein means the charge for the course or courses determined on the basis of the lowest extended time payment plan offered by the institution and approved by the appropriate State approving agency or the actual cost to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse, whichever is the lesser. Such allowance shall be paid quarterly on a pro rata basis for the lessons completed by the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and serviced by the institution.
<br>
<br>(2) The period of entitlement of any veteran or spouse or surviving spouse who is pursuing any program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be charged with one month for each $376 which is paid to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse as an educational assistance allowance for such course.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law unless enacted in express limitation of this paragraph, funds in the Department of Veterans Affairs readjustment benefits account shall be available for payments under paragraph (1) of this subsection for pursuit of a program of education exclusively by correspondence in which the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse enrolls after September 30, 1981.
<br>
<br>(b) The enrollment agreement shall fully disclose the obligation of both the institution and the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and shall prominently display the provisions for affirmance, termination, refunds, and the conditions under which payment of the allowance is made by the Secretary to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. A copy of the enrollment agreement shall be furnished to each such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at the time such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse signs such agreement. No such agreement shall be effective unless such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse shall, after the expiration of five days after the enrollment agreement is signed, have signed and submitted to the Secretary a written statement, with a signed copy to the institution, specifically affirming the enrollment agreement. In the event the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at any time notifies the institution of such veteran's or spouse's intention not to affirm the agreement in accordance with the preceding sentence, the institution, without imposing any penalty or charging any fee shall promptly make a full refund of all amounts paid.
<br>
<br>(c) In the event a veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate such veteran's or spouse's enrollment under an affirmed enrollment agreement, the institution may charge the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse a registration or similar fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the course, or $50, whichever is less. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of one or more but less than 25 percent of the total number of lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain such registration or similar fee plus 25 percent of the tuition for the course. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain the full registration or similar fee plus 50 percent of the course tuition. If 50 percent or more of the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.

<br>
<br>" '(2)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), for any month in which an individual fails to complete 120 hours of training, the entitlement otherwise chargeable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced in the same proportion as the monthly training assistance allowance payable is reduced under subsection (b)(3).
<br>
<br>" '(B) In the case of an individual who is unemployed during any month, the 120-hour requirement under subparagraph (A) for that month shall be reduced proportionately to reflect the individual's period of unemployment, except that the amount of monthly training assistance otherwise payable to the individual under subsection (b)(3) shall not be reduced.

Any excess hours applied to a different month under this subparagraph may only be applied to one such month.
