For the purposes of its rules or regulations the Commission may classify persons and matters within its jurisdiction and prescribe different requirements for different classes of persons or matters.
<br>(b) Effective date of regulations

<br>Subject to the provisions of chapter 15 of title 44 and regulations prescribed under the authority thereof, the rules and regulations of the Commission under this subchapter, and amendments thereof, shall be effective upon publication in the manner which the Commission shall prescribe, or upon such later date as may be provided in such rules and regulations.

Notice to interested persons, if any, other than parties may be given in the same manner or by publication in the Federal Register.
<br>(d) Good faith compliance with rules and regulations
<br>
<br>No provision of this subchapter imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, notwithstanding that such rule, regulation, or order may, after such act or omission, be amended or rescinded or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
<br>(e) Disclosure rules on private funds
<br>
<br>The Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall, after consultation with the Council but not later than 12 months after July 21, 2010, jointly promulgate rules to establish the form and content of the reports required to be filed with the Commission under subsection 1 80b–4(b) of this title and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by investment advisers that are registered both under this subchapter and the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
<br>(g) 2 Standard of conduct
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice. In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer. Such rules shall provide that such standard of conduct shall be no less stringent than the standard applicable to investment advisers under section 80b–6(1) and (2) of this title when providing personalized investment advice about securities, except the Commission shall not ascribe a meaning to the term "customer" that would include an investor in a private fund managed by an investment adviser, where such private fund has entered into an advisory contract with such adviser. The receipt of compensation based on commission or fees shall not, in and of itself, be considered a violation of such standard applied to a broker, dealer, or investment adviser.
<br>(2) Retail customer defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "retail customer" means a natural person, or the legal representative of such natural person, who—
<br>
<br>(A) receives personalized investment advice about securities from a broker, dealer, or investment adviser; and
<br>
<br>(B) uses such advice primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.
<br>(h) Other matters
<br>
<br>The Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any material conflicts of interest; and
<br>
<br>(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors.
<br>(i) Harmonization of enforcement
<br>
<br>The enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to such violations provided under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations, and
<br>
<br>the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser under this subchapter to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and sanctions violators of the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.].

<br>
<br>In the first sentence, the words "(except as provided by the Act entitled 'An Act creating a United States Court for China and prescribing the jurisdiction thereof,' approved June 30, 1906, as amended)" have been omitted because that Act (formerly classified to sections 191 to 197, 199, 200, and 202 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse) was repealed by act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, §39, 62 Stat. 992, eff. Sept. 1, 1948.
<br>
<br>The provision in the second sentence that suits against the China Trade Act corporation might also be brought in the United States Court for China was omitted as that court is no longer in operation. By the treaty of Jan. 11, 1943, between the United States and China, the United States relinquished extraterritorial rights in China. See Codification note set out under section 142 of this title.
<br>

<br>
<br>(Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 346, §7, 42 Stat. 851; Feb. 26, 1925, ch. 345, §7, 43 Stat. 996.)
