<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 3, 1995, 60 F.R. 52289, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Section 2451 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103–355 ([amending former] 41 U.S.C. 15 [see 41 U.S.C. 6305]) ("Act"), provides, in part, that "[a]ny contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy or any other department or agency of the United States designated by the President, except [contracts where] . . . full payment has been made, may, upon a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under [the] contract shall not be subject to reduction or set-off."
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby designate all other departments and agencies of the United States as subject to this provision. Furthermore, I hereby delegate to the Secretaries of Defense and Energy, the Administrator of General Services, and the heads of all other departments and agencies, the authority under section 2451 of the Act to make determinations of need for their respective agency's contracts, subject to such further guidance as issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
<br>
<br>The authority delegated by this memorandum may be further delegated within the departments and agencies.
<br>
<br>This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the words "Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933" and "Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation Act" are omitted because all provisions of those Acts have previously been executed or repealed.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2)(B), the words "Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.)" are substituted for "Federal Farm Loan Act" and "Farm Credit Act of 1933" because of section 5.40(a), formerly 5.26(a), of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Pub. L. 92–181, 12 U.S.C. 2001 note).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2)(C), the words "Home Owners' Loan Act" are substituted for "Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933" because of the amendment to 12:1461 made by Public Law 101–73.
<br>§6307. Contracts with Federal Government-owned establishments and availability of appropriations
<br>
<br>An order or contract placed with a Federal Government-owned establishment for work, material, or the manufacture of material pertaining to an approved project is deemed to be an obligation in the same manner that a similar order or contract placed with a commercial manufacturer or private contractor is an obligation. Appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a Federal Government-owned establishment just as appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a commercial manufacturer or private contractor.

<br>The words "bullion, cash, or securities of the Federal Government" are substituted for "moneys, bullion, coin, notes, bonds, and other securities of the United States, and paper" to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "awarded" is substituted for "let" to use more modern terminology.
<br>§6309. Honorable discharge certificate in lieu of birth certificate
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—An employer described in subsection (b) may not deny employment, on account of failure to produce a birth certificate, to an individual who submits, in lieu of the birth certificate, an honorable discharge certificate (or certificate issued in lieu of an honorable discharge certificate) from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Space Force, or Coast Guard of the United States, unless the honorable discharge certificate shows on its face that the individual may have been an alien at the time of its issuance.

<br>
<br>(1) engaged in—

<br>

<br>(2) engaged in the activity described in paragraph (1) under—
<br>
<br>(A) a contract with the Federal Government; or

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "Air Force" are added because of section 207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 502, 503). Section 207(a) and (f) was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, "Armed Forces" and under subtitle D of title 10 the Department of the Air Force remained an independent administrative entity in the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b)(2)(B) is set out as a separate provision to clarify that the certification applies only to contracts other than contracts with the Federal Government. If the certification were to be construed as applying to all contracts, then the words "under a contract with the United States or" in section 2 of the Act of June 22, 1942, would be rendered meaningless.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2)(B), the words "Secretary of the Army" are substituted for "Secretary of War", and the words "Secretary of the Air Force" are added, because of sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501, 502, 503). Sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, "Armed Forces" and under sections 3010 to 3013 and 8010 to 8013 the Departments of the Army and Air Force remained under the administrative supervision of the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force, respectively. The words "Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating" are substituted for "Secretary of Transportation" because of 6:468(b) and (h), 551(d), and 552(d), 14:1 and 3, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002 (H. Doc. No. 108–16, 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (6 U.S.C. 542 note)).

<br>Executive Documents
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13126. Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13126, June 12, 1999, 64 F.R. 32383, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to continue the executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive child labor practices, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section. 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307, the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 et. seq., and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act [Walsh-Healey Act], [former] 41 U.S.C. 35 et seq. [see 41 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.], that executive agencies shall take appropriate actions to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Publication of List. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of products, identified by their country of origin, that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those products.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Procurement Regulations. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed rules to implement the following:
<br>
<br>(a) Required Solicitation Provisions. Each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list published under section 2 of this order shall include the following provisions:
<br>
<br>(1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract and that, on the basis of those efforts, the contractor is unaware of any such use of child labor; and
<br>
<br>(2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of the contracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract.
<br>
<br>(b) Investigations. Whenever a contracting officer of an executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(c) Remedies.
<br>
<br>(1) The head of an executive agency may impose remedies as provided in this subsection in the case of a contractor under a contract of the executive agency if the head of the executive agency finds that the contractor:
<br>
<br>(i) Has furnished under the contract products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in the mining, production, or manufacturing operations of the contractor;
<br>
<br>(ii) Has submitted a false certification under subsection 3(a)(1) of this order; or
<br>
<br>(iii) Has failed to cooperate in accordance with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection 3(a)(2) of this order.
<br>
<br>(2) The head of an executive agency, in his or her sole discretion, may terminate a contract on the basis of any finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order for any contract entered into after the date the regulation called for in section 3 of this order is published in final.
<br>
<br>(3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order. The provision for debarment may not exceed 3 years.
<br>
<br>(4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.
<br>
<br>(5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Report. Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Scope. (a) Any proposed rules issued pursuant to section 3 of this order shall apply only to acquisitions for a total amount in excess of the micro-purchase threshold as defined in section 32(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)).
<br>
<br>(b) This order does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any product, or any article, material, or supply contained in a product that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country if:
<br>
<br>(1) the foreign country is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"); and
<br>
<br>(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Definitions. (a) "Executive agency" and "agency" have the meaning given to "executive agency" in section 4(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).
<br>
<br>(b) "WTO Agreement" means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.
<br>
<br>(c) "Forced or indentured child labor" means all work or service (1) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself voluntarily; or (2) performed by any person under the age of 18 pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by process or penalties.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person.
<br>
<br>William J. Clinton.      
<br>§6502. Required contract terms
<br>
<br>A contract made by an agency of the United States for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment, in an amount exceeding $10,000, shall include the following representations and stipulations:
<br>
<br>(1) Minimum wages to be paid.—All individuals employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, not less than the prevailing minimum wages, as determined by the Secretary, for individuals employed in similar work or in the particular or similar industries or groups of industries currently operating in the locality in which the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment are to be manufactured or furnished under the contract, except that this paragraph applies only to purchases or contracts relating to industries that have been the subject matter of a determination by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Maximum number of hours to be worked in a week.—No individual employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract shall be permitted to work in excess of 40 hours in any one week, except that this paragraph does not apply to an employer who has entered into an agreement with employees pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 7(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(b)(1) or (2)).
<br>
<br>(3) Ineligible employees.—No individual under 16 years of age and no incarcerated individual will be employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract, except that this section, or other law or executive order containing similar prohibitions against the purchase of goods by the Federal Government, does not apply to convict labor that satisfies the conditions of section 1761(c) of title 18.
<br>
<br>(4) Standards of places and working conditions where contract performed.—No part of the contract will be performed, and no materials, supplies, articles, or equipment will be manufactured or fabricated under the contract, in plants, factories, buildings, or surroundings, or under working conditions, that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health and safety of employees engaged in the performance of the contract. Compliance with the safety, sanitary, and factory inspection laws of the State in which the work or part of the work is to be performed is prima facie evidence of compliance with this paragraph.

<br>
<br>In the matter before paragraph (1), the words "and entered into" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (1), the words "under the contract" are substituted for "used in the performance of the contract" in 41:35(a) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter. The words "Sections 35 to 45 of this title shall apply to all contracts entered into pursuant to invitations for bids issued on or after ninety days from June 30, 1936" in 41:45 are omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (2), the words "under the contract" are substituted for "used in the performance of the contract" to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (3), the words "No individual under 16 years of age" are substituted for "no male person under sixteen years of age and no female person under eighteen years of age" to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000e–2), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50–201.104. The words "incarcerated individual" are substituted for "convict labor" the first time the words appear because the term "convict labor" is ambiguous and may be interpreted to include individuals who are not incarcerated. This would be an inappropriate interpretation because 41:35(c) provides an exception for "convict labor" that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c) regarding certain non-Federal prison work projects. The words "or production" are omitted for consistency with the source provisions for paragraphs (1) and (2) and because, in this context, the concept of "production" is included in the words "manufacture or furnishing". The words "under the contract" are substituted for "included in such contract" for consistency in the chapter.
<br>§6503. Breach or violation of required contract terms
<br>
<br>(a) Applicable Breach or Violation.—This section applies in case of breach or violation of a representation or stipulation included in a contract under section 6502 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Liquidated Damages.—In addition to damages for any other breach of the contract, the party responsible for a breach or violation described in subsection (a) is liable to the Federal Government for the following liquidated damages:
<br>
<br>(1) An amount equal to the sum of $10 per day for each individual under 16 years of age and each incarcerated individual knowingly employed in the performance of the contract.
<br>
<br>(2) An amount equal to the sum of each underpayment of wages due an employee engaged in the performance of the contract, including any underpayments arising from deductions, rebates, or refunds.
<br>
<br>(c) Cancellation and Alternative Completion.—In addition to the Federal Government being entitled to damages described in subsection (b), the agency of the United States that made the contract may cancel the contract and make open-market purchases or make other contracts for the completion of the original contract, charging any additional cost to the original contractor.
<br>
<br>(d) Recovery of Amounts Due.—An amount due the Federal Government because of a breach or violation described in subsection (a) may be withheld from any amounts owed the contractor under any contract under section 6502 of this title or may be recovered in a suit brought by the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>(e) Employee Reimbursement for Underpayment of Wages.—An amount withheld or recovered under subsection (d) that is based on an underpayment of wages as described in subsection (b)(2) shall be held in a special deposit account. On order of the Secretary, the amount shall be paid directly to the underpaid employee on whose account the amount was withheld or recovered. However, an employee's claim for payment under this subsection may be entertained only if made within one year from the date of actual notice to the contractor of the withholding or recovery.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "individual under 16 years of age" are substituted for "male person under sixteen years of age or each female person under eighteen years of age" to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000e–2), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50–201.104. The words "incarcerated individual" are substituted for "convict laborer" because of the exception to convict labor that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c). Section 1761 does not apply to non-incarcerated convicts.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for "a sum equal to the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or underpayment of wages due to any employee engaged in the performance of such contract" for consistency in the chapter.

<br>In subsection (c), the words "made the contract" and "make other contracts" are substituted for "entering into such contract" and "enter into other contracts", respectively, for consistency in the revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "suit brought by the Attorney General" are substituted for "suits brought in the name of the United States of America by the Attorney General thereof " to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§6504. Three-year prohibition on new contracts in case of breach or violation
<br>
<br>(a) Distribution of List.—The Comptroller General shall distribute to each agency of the United States a list containing the names of persons found by the Secretary to have breached or violated a representation or stipulation included in a contract under section 6502 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Three-Year Prohibition.—Unless the Secretary recommends otherwise, a contract described in section 6502 of this title may not be awarded to a person named on the list under subsection (a), or to a firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which the person has a controlling interest, until 3 years have elapsed from the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "or violated" are added for consistency in the chapter.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "contract described in section 6502 of this title" are substituted for "contracts" to clarify the scope of the prohibition. The words "the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred" are substituted for "the date the Secretary of Labor determines such breach to have occurred" to clarify that the three-year period begins with the date of the Secretary's determination and not with the date of the breach or violation. The words "or violation" are added for consistency in the chapter.
<br>§6505. Exclusions
<br>
<br>(a) Items Available in the Open Market.—This chapter does not apply to the purchase of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment that may usually be bought in the open market.

<br>
<br>(1) the carriage of freight or personnel by vessel, airplane, bus, truck, express, or railway line where published tariff rates are in effect; or

<br>(a) In General.—The Secretary shall administer this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Regulations.—The Secretary may make, amend, and rescind regulations as necessary to carry out this chapter.

<br>
<br>(d) Appointments.—The Secretary shall appoint an administrative officer and attorneys, experts, and other employees from time to time as the Secretary finds necessary for the administration of this chapter.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the word "rules" is omitted as included in "regulations".
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "and to prescribe rules and regulations with respect thereto" are omitted as unnecessary because of subsection (b).
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "without regard to the provisions of the civil-service laws", which appear in section 4 of the Walsh-Healey Act (June 30, 1936, ch. 881, 49 Stat. 2038), are omitted as obsolete because of Executive Order 8743, April 23, 1941 (5 U.S.C. 3301 note), issued by the President pursuant to the Act of November 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, §1, 54 Stat. 1211. The words "the Classification Act of 1923", which appear in section 4 of the Walsh-Healey Act (June 30, 1936, ch. 881, 49 Stat. 2038), are considered to be a reference to the Classification Act of 1949 because of section 1106(a) of the Classification Act of 1949 (Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, 63 Stat. 972). The words "chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5" are substituted for the reference to the Classification Act of 1949 because of section 7(b) of Public Law 89–554 (5 U.S.C. note prec. 101).
<br>§6507. Hearing authority and procedures
<br>
<br>(a) Record and Hearing Requirements for Wage Determinations.—A wage determination under section 6502(1) of this title shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
<br>
<br>(b) Authority To Hold Hearings.—The Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may hold hearings when there is a complaint of breach or violation of a representation or stipulation included in a contract under section 6502 of this title. The Secretary may initiate hearings on the Secretary's own motion or on the application of a person affected by the ruling of an agency of the United States relating to a proposal or contract under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(c) Orders To Compel Testimony.—The Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may issue orders requiring witnesses to attend hearings held under this section and to produce evidence and testify under oath. Witnesses shall be paid fees and mileage at the same rates as witnesses in courts of the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) Enforcement of Orders.—If a person refuses or fails to obey an order issued under subsection (c), the Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may bring an action to enforce the order in a district court of the United States or in the district court of a territory or possession of the United States. A court has jurisdiction to enforce the order if the inquiry is being carried out within the court's judicial district or if the person is found or resides or transacts business within the court's judicial district. The court may issue an order requiring the person to obey the order issued under subsection (c), and the court may punish any further refusal or failure as contempt of court.
<br>
<br>(e) Findings of Fact.—After notice and a hearing, the Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary shall make findings of fact. The findings are conclusive for agencies of the United States. If supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the findings are conclusive in any court of the United States.
<br>
<br>(f) Decisions.—The Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may make decisions, based on findings of fact, that are considered necessary to enforce this chapter.

<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the word "contumacy" is omitted as included in "refuses or fails". The words "may bring an action to enforce the order" are substituted for "upon the application by" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "the United States District Court for the District of Columbia" in section 5 of the Act of June 30, 1936 (which were substituted for "the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia" by section 32(b) of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 646, 62 Stat. 991), as amended by section 127 of the Act of May 24, 1949 (ch. 139, 63 Stat. 107), and which were editorially omitted from 41:39) are omitted as included in "a district court of the United States" because of sections 88 and 132(a) of title 28, United States Code. The words "within the court's judicial district"' are substituted for "within the jurisdiction of which" for clarity and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "requiring the person to obey the order issued under subsection (c)" are substituted for "requiring such person to appear before him or representative designated by him, to produce evidence if, as, and when so ordered, and to give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the duty to make findings of fact is restated as a duty of the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative). The grammatical structure of the last sentence of 41:39 seems to suggest that the court, rather than the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative), serves as fact finder. However, the provision taken as a whole indicates that it is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) who serves as fact finder. It is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) before whom hearings are held, witnesses testify, and evidence is produced. The court's involvement is limited to compelling recalcitrant witnesses "to appear before him [the Secretary] or representative designated by him". The restatement clarifies the generally accepted understanding that the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) serves as fact finder (see, e.g., United States v. Sweet Briar, 92 F. Supp. 777, 780 (W.D.S.C. 1950) ("the Secretary 'shall make findings of fact' "); Ready-Mix Concrete Company v. United States, 158 F. Supp. 571, 578 (Cl. Ct. 1958) ("the findings of the Department of Labor")).
<br>§6508. Authority to make exceptions
<br>
<br>(a) Duty of the Secretary To Make Exceptions.—When the head of an agency of the United States makes a written finding that the inclusion of representations or stipulations under section 6502 of this title in a proposal or contract will seriously impair the conduct of Federal Government business, the Secretary shall make exceptions, in specific cases or otherwise, when justice or the public interest will be served.
<br>
<br>(b) Authority of the Secretary To Modify Existing Contracts.—When an agency of the United States and a contractor jointly recommend, the Secretary may modify the terms of an existing contract with respect to minimum wages and maximum hours of labor as the Secretary finds necessary and proper in the public interest or to prevent injustice and undue hardship.
<br>
<br>(c) Authority of the Secretary To Allow Limitations, Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions.—The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations to allow reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions in the application of this chapter to contractors, including with respect to minimum wages and maximum hours of labor.
<br>
<br>(d) Rate of Pay for Overtime.—When the Secretary permits an increase in the maximum hours of labor stipulated in a contract, the Secretary shall set a rate of pay for overtime. The overtime rate must be at least one and one-half times the basic hourly rate.
<br>
<br>(e) Authority of the President To Suspend.—The President may suspend any of the representations and stipulations contained in section 6502 of this title whenever, in the President's judgment, suspension is in the public interest.

<br>In subsection (a), the words "an agency of the United States" are substituted for "the contracting agency or department" for consistency in the chapter. Commas are inserted after "exceptions" and "otherwise" to clarify that the words "when justice or the public interest will be served" apply to exceptions in "specific cases" as well as "otherwise". The word "thereby" is omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "an agency of the United States" are substituted for "the contracting agency", and the words "minimum wages" are substituted for "minimum rates of pay", for consistency in the chapter.

<br>(a) Applicability of Certain Administrative Provisions.—Notwithstanding section 553 of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5 are applicable in the administration of sections 6501 to 6507 and 6511 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Judicial Review in General.—Notwithstanding the inclusion of representations and stipulations in a contract under section 6502 of this title, an interested person has the right of judicial review of any legal question which might otherwise be raised, including wage determinations and the interpretation of the terms "locality" and "open market".
<br>
<br>(c) Judicial Review of Wage Determinations.—A person adversely affected or aggrieved by a wage determination under section 6502(1) of this title has the right of judicial review of the determination, or of the applicability of the determination, within 90 days after the determination is made, in the manner provided by chapter 7 of title 5. A person adversely affected or aggrieved by a wage determination is deemed to include a person in an industry to which the determination applies that is a supplier of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment that are purchased or intended to be purchased by the Federal Government from any source.

<br>(a) Prescribing Standards.—The Secretary may prescribe, in regulations, standards for determining whether a contractor is a manufacturer or regular dealer with respect to materials, supplies, articles, or equipment to be manufactured or furnished under, or used in the performance of, a contract entered into by an agency of the United States.
<br>

<br>Paragraph (1) is substituted for "Title III of the act entitled 'An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes', approved May 3, 1933 (commonly known as the Buy American Act)" for consistency in the revised title and to correct an error in the source, which incorrectly gives May 3, 1933, rather than March 3, 1933, as the date of approval.
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2) is substituted for "the Act entitled 'An Act relating to the rate of wages for laborers and mechanics employed on public buildings of the United States and the District of Columbia by contractors and subcontractors, and for other purposes', approved March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the Bacon-Davis Act), as amended from time to time" because of section 5(c) of Public Law 107–217 (40 U.S.C. note prec. 101) and for consistency with title 40.
<br>
<br>The words "the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended" are omitted as obsolete because of section 201 of the Act of June 21, 1938 (ch. 554, 52 Stat. 816), as amended by the Acts of June 27, 1940 (ch. 437, 54 Stat. 633), April 5, 1941 (ch. 40, 55 Stat. 110), and June 27, 1942 (ch. 450, 56 Stat. 410).
<br>
<br>The words "or [the labor provisions] of section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935" are omitted as obsolete. The intended reference was probably to section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 118). Section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 provided that the President shall require certain rates of pay for persons engaged in carrying out projects that were financed by amounts being appropriated in that Act.
<br>
<br>Paragraph (3) is substituted for "the Act entitled 'An Act to provide for the diversification of employment of Federal prisoners, for their training and schooling in trades and occupations, and for other purposes', approved May 27, 1930, as amended and supplemented by the Act approved June 23, 1934" for consistency with title 18. The Act of May 27, 1930 (ch. 340, 46 Stat. 391) and the Act of June 23, 1934 (ch. 736, 48 Stat. 1211), which were classified to sections 744a to 744n of former title 18, were substantially repealed and were replaced by chapter 307 and section 4162 of title 18 in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683). Subsequently, section 4162 of title 18 was repealed by section 218(a)(4) of Public Law 98–473 (98 Stat. 2027).

<br>
<br>In paragraph (3), the word "individual" is substituted for "person" because of the definition of "person" in 1:1. The words "contract made by the Federal Government" are substituted for "contract entered into by the United States" for consistency in the revised title. The words "as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations" are omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (4)(A), the words "the outer Continental Shelf" are substituted for "Outer Continental Shelf lands" for consistency with the definition in 43:1331 and for consistency with the more common usage generally found in subchapter III of chapter 29 of title 43. The words "Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll" are omitted because they are part of the Marshall Islands and therefore no longer part of the United States. The words "Canton Island" are omitted because it is part of Kiribati and therefore no longer part of the United States.

<br>§6705. Violations
<br>
<br>(a) Liability of Responsible Party.—A party responsible for a violation of a contract provision required under section 6703(1) or (2) of this title or a violation of section 6704 of this title is liable for an amount equal to the sum of any deduction, rebate, refund, or underpayment of compensation due any employee engaged in the performance of the contract.
<br>
<br>(b) Recovery of Amounts Underpaid to Employees.—
<br>
<br>(1) Withholding accrued payments due on contracts.—The total amount determined under subsection (a) to be due any employee engaged in the performance of a contract may be withheld from accrued payments due on the contract or on any other contract between the same contractor and the Federal Government. The amount withheld shall be held in a deposit fund. On order of the Secretary, the compensation found by the Secretary or the head of a Federal agency to be due an underpaid employee pursuant to this chapter shall be paid from the deposit fund directly to the underpaid employee.
<br>
<br>(2) Bringing actions against contractors.—If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse a service employee with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation required pursuant to this chapter, the Federal Government may bring action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayment. Any amount recovered shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee. Any amount not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within 3 years shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(c) Cancellation and Alternative Completion.—In addition to other actions in accordance with this section, when a violation of any contract stipulation is found, the Federal agency that made the contract may cancel the contract on written notice to the original contractor.

<br>
<br>(d) Enforcement of Section.—In accordance with regulations prescribed pursuant to section 6707(a)–(d) of this title, the Secretary or the head of a Federal agency may carry out this section.

The words "containing the name of such persons or firms" are omitted as unnecessary. The word "person" is substituted for "individual" for consistency in the subsection.
<br>§6707. Enforcement and administration of chapter
<br>
<br>(a) Enforcement of Chapter.—Sections 6506 and 6507 of this title govern the Secretary's authority to enforce this chapter, including the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, hold hearings, make decisions based on findings of fact, and take other appropriate action under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Limitations and Regulations for Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions.—The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations allowing reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions with respect to this chapter (other than subsection (f)), but only in special circumstances where the Secretary determines that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Federal Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.
<br>
<br>(c) Preservation of Wages and Benefits Due Under Predecessor Contracts.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Under a contract which succeeds a contract subject to this chapter, and under which substantially the same services are furnished, a contractor or subcontractor may not pay a service employee less than the wages and fringe benefits the service employee would have received under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations.
<br>
<br>(2) Exception.—This subsection does not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that wages and fringe benefits under the predecessor contract are substantially at variance with wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the same locality for services of a similar character.
<br>
<br>(d) Duration of Contracts.—Subject to limitations in annual appropriation acts but notwithstanding any other law, a contract to which this chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any term of years not exceeding 5, if the contract provides for periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in section 6703 of this title at least once every 2 years during the term of the contract, covering each class of service employee.
<br>
<br>(e) Exclusion of Fringe Benefit Payments in Determining Overtime Pay.—In determining any overtime pay to which a service employee is entitled under Federal law, the regular or basic hourly rate of pay of the service employee does not include any fringe benefit payments computed under this chapter which are excluded from the definition of "regular rate" under section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(e)).
<br>
<br>(f) Timeliness of Wage and Fringe Benefit Determinations.—It is the intent of Congress that determinations of minimum wages and fringe benefits under section 6703(1) and (2) of this title should be made as soon as administratively feasible for all contracts subject to this chapter. In any event, the Secretary shall at least make the determinations for contracts under which more than 5 service employees are to be employed.

The words "which are entered into during the applicable fiscal year", 41:358(1)–(4), and the words "On and after July 1, 1976" are omitted as obsolete.

<br>§7103. Decision by contracting officer
<br>
<br>(a) Claims Generally.—
<br>
<br>(1) Submission of contractor's claims to contracting officer.—Each claim by a contractor against the Federal Government relating to a contract shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.
<br>
<br>(2) Contractor's claims in writing.—Each claim by a contractor against the Federal Government relating to a contract shall be in writing.
<br>
<br>(3) Contracting officer to decide federal government's claims.—Each claim by the Federal Government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be the subject of a written decision by the contracting officer.
<br>
<br>(4) Time for submitting claims.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Each claim by a contractor against the Federal Government relating to a contract and each claim by the Federal Government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be submitted within 6 years after the accrual of the claim.
<br>
<br>(B) Exception.—Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not apply to a claim by the Federal Government against a contractor that is based on a claim by the contractor involving fraud.
<br>
<br>(5) Applicability.—The authority of this subsection and subsections (c)(1), (d), and (e) does not extend to a claim or dispute for penalties or forfeitures prescribed by statute or regulation that another Federal agency is specifically authorized to administer, settle, or determine.
<br>
<br>(b) Certification of Claims.—
<br>
<br>(1) Requirement generally.—For claims of more than $100,000 made by a contractor, the contractor shall certify that—
<br>
<br>(A) the claim is made in good faith;
<br>
<br>(B) the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief;
<br>
<br>(C) the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the Federal Government is liable; and
<br>
<br>(D) the certifier is authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.
<br>
<br>(2) Who may execute certification.—The certification required by paragraph (1) may be executed by an individual authorized to bind the contractor with respect to the claim.
<br>
<br>(3) Failure to certify or defective certification.—A contracting officer is not obligated to render a final decision on a claim of more than $100,000 that is not certified in accordance with paragraph (1) if, within 60 days after receipt of the claim, the contracting officer notifies the contractor in writing of the reasons why any attempted certification was found to be defective. A defect in the certification of a claim does not deprive a court or an agency board of jurisdiction over the claim. Prior to the entry of a final judgment by a court or a decision by an agency board, the court or agency board shall require a defective certification to be corrected.
<br>
<br>(c) Fraudulent Claims.—
<br>
<br>(1) No authority to settle.—This section does not authorize an agency head to settle, compromise, pay, or otherwise adjust any claim involving fraud.
<br>
<br>(2) Liability of contractor.—If a contractor is unable to support any part of the contractor's claim and it is determined that the inability is attributable to a misrepresentation of fact or fraud by the contractor, then the contractor is liable to the Federal Government for an amount equal to the unsupported part of the claim plus all of the Federal Government's costs attributable to reviewing the unsupported part of the claim. Liability under this paragraph shall be determined within 6 years of the commission of the misrepresentation of fact or fraud.
<br>
<br>(d) Issuance of Decision.—The contracting officer shall issue a decision in writing and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the decision to the contractor.
<br>
<br>(e) Contents of Decision.—The contracting officer's decision shall state the reasons for the decision reached and shall inform the contractor of the contractor's rights as provided in this chapter. Specific findings of fact are not required. If made, specific findings of fact are not binding in any subsequent proceeding.
<br>
<br>(f) Time for Issuance of Decision.—
<br>
<br>(1) Claim of $100,000 or less.—A contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted claim of $100,000 or less within 60 days from the contracting officer's receipt of a written request from the contractor that a decision be rendered within that period.

<br>
<br>(A) issue a decision; or
<br>
<br>(B) notify the contractor of the time within which a decision will be issued.
<br>
<br>(3) General requirement of reasonableness.—The decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims shall be issued within a reasonable time, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the agency, taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of information in support of the claim provided by the contractor.
<br>
<br>(4) Requesting tribunal to direct issuance within specified time period.—A contractor may request the tribunal concerned to direct a contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the tribunal concerned, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.
<br>
<br>(5) Failure to issue decision within required time period.—Failure by a contracting officer to issue a decision on a claim within the required time period is deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and authorizes an appeal or action on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter. However, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings of the appeal or action to obtain a decision by the contracting officer.
<br>
<br>(g) Finality of Decision Unless Appealed.—The contracting officer's decision on a claim is final and conclusive and is not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or Federal Government agency, unless an appeal or action is timely commenced as authorized by this chapter. This chapter does not prohibit an executive agency from including a clause in a Federal Government contract requiring that, pending final decision of an appeal, action, or final settlement, a contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract in accordance with the contracting officer's decision.
<br>
<br>(h) Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a contractor and a contracting officer may use any alternative means of dispute resolution under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, or other mutually agreeable procedures, for resolving claims. All provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5 apply to alternative means of dispute resolution under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Certification of claim.—The contractor shall certify the claim when required to do so under subsection (b)(1) or other law.
<br>
<br>(3) Rejecting request for alternative dispute resolution.—
<br>
<br>(A) Contracting officer.—A contracting officer who rejects a contractor's request for alternative dispute resolution proceedings shall provide the contractor with a written explanation, citing one or more of the conditions in section 572(b) of title 5 or other specific reasons that alternative dispute resolution procedures are inappropriate.
<br>
<br>(B) Contractor.—A contractor that rejects an agency's request for alternative dispute resolution proceedings shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the request.
