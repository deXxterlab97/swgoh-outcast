<br>
<br>"(b) No Substantive Change.—This Act makes no substantive change in existing law and may not be construed as making a substantive change in existing law.
<br>
<br>"(c) Severability.—If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications."
<br>

<br>"(b) No Substantive Change.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—This Act makes no substantive change in existing law and may not be construed as making a substantive change in existing law.
<br>
<br>"(2) Deemed date of enactment for certain purposes.—For purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes another based on enactment later in time, and otherwise to ensure that this Act makes no substantive change in existing law, the date of enactment of a provision restated in section 1 or 2 of this Act is deemed to remain unchanged, continuing to be the date of enactment of the underlying provision of public law that is being restated.
<br>
<br>"(3) Inconsistent laws enacted after March 31, 2002.—This Act restates certain laws enacted before April 1, 2002.

<br>
<br>"(e) Actions and Offenses Under Prior Law.—An action taken or an offense committed under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act is deemed to have been taken or committed under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
<br>
<br>"(f) Inferences.—An inference of a legislative construction is not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a caption or catch line of the provision.
<br>
<br>"(g) Severability.—If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications."

<br>
<br>In this section, the words "and in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)" are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words "this Act", meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under section 111 of this title. The definition of "Administrator" is omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:472(i) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "person" in 1:1.
<br>
<br>In clause (6), the words "the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau" are substituted for "the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands" because of the termination of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. See 48:1681 note prec.
