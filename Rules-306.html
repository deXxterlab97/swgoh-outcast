<br>"(2) Aliens exempt from employment-based numerical limitations.—For purposes of the application of sections 201 through 203 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151–1153) in any fiscal year, aliens eligible to be provided status under this section shall be treated as special immigrants described in section 101(a)(27) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(27)) who are not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (K) of such section and shall not be counted against the numerical limitations under sections 201(d), 202(a), and 203(b)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151(d), 1152(a), and 1153(b)(4)).

<br>Battered Immigrant Women; Findings and Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–386, div. B, title V, §1502, Oct. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 1518, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, title IV, see Tables for classification] was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive relationships;
<br>
<br>"(2) providing battered immigrant women and children who were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against their abusers and the abusers of their children without fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit under the abuser's control; and
<br>
<br>"(3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women and children who do not have access to the immigration protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which means that their abusers are virtually immune from prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result of action by their abusers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter how compelling their case under existing law.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note above] are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against immigrant women and children; and
<br>
<br>"(2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring in family and intimate relationships that are covered in State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and family law statutes."
<br>Protection for Certain Crime Victims Including Victims of Crimes Against Women
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–386, div. B, title V, §1513(a), Oct. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 1533, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings and Purpose.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(A) Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be victims of crimes committed against them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage or being criminally restrained.
<br>
<br>"(B) All women and children who are victims of these crimes committed against them in the United States must be able to report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in the investigation of the crimes committed against them and the prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes.
<br>
<br>"(2) Purpose.—
<br>
<br>"(A) The purpose of this section [amending this section and sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367 of this title] is to create a new nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)] committed against aliens, while offering protection to victims of such offenses in keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will encourage law enforcement officials to better serve immigrant crime victims and to prosecute crimes committed against aliens.
<br>
<br>"(B) Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will facilitate the reporting of crimes to law enforcement officials by trafficked, exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are not in lawful immigration status. It also gives law enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing temporary legal status to aliens who have been severely victimized by criminal activity also comports with the humanitarian interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(C) Finally, this section gives the Attorney General discretion to convert the status of such nonimmigrants to that of permanent residents when doing so is justified on humanitarian grounds, for family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest."

<br>
<br>"(2) amendments to a section or other provision are to such section or other provision before any amendment made to such section or other provision elsewhere in this division."

<br>Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title V, §592, Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–688, provided that: "This title [see Effective Date of 1996 Amendment note above] does not apply to any Federal, State, or local governmental program, assistance, or benefits provided to an alien under any program of foreign assistance as determined by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Attorney General."
