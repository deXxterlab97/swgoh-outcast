<br>§1417. Option to request remote work assignment or paid leave of absence during pendency of procedures
<br>(a) Options for employees

<br>
<br>At the request of a covered employee who files a claim alleging a violation of part A of subchapter II by the covered employee's employing office, during the pendency of any of the procedures available under this subchapter for consideration of the claim, the employing office may permit the covered employee to carry out the employee's responsibilities from a remote location (referred to in this section as "permitting a remote work assignment") where such relocation would have the effect of materially reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation, instead of from a location of the employing office.
<br>(2) Exception for work assignments required to be carried out onsite
<br>
<br>If, in the determination of the covered employee's employing office, a covered employee who makes a request under this subsection cannot carry out the employee's responsibilities from a remote location or such relocation would not have the effect described in paragraph (1), the employing office may during the pendency of the procedures described in paragraph (1)—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) permit a remote work assignment and grant a paid leave of absence to the covered employee; or
<br>
<br>(C) make another workplace adjustment, or permit a remote work assignment, that would have the effect of reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation described in paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Ensuring no retaliation
<br>
<br>An employing office may not grant a covered employee's request under this subsection in a manner which would constitute a violation of section 1317 of this title.
<br>(4) No impact on vacation or personal leave
<br>
<br>In granting leave for a paid leave of absence under this section, an employing office shall not require the covered employee to substitute, for that leave, any of the accrued paid vacation or personal leave of the covered employee.
<br>(b) Exception for arrangements subject to collective bargaining agreements
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) does not apply to the extent that it is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement which is in effect with respect to an employing office.

<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal governments;
<br>
<br>(2) to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate Federal funding, in a manner that may displace other essential State, local, and tribal governmental priorities;
<br>
<br>(3) to assist Congress in its consideration of proposed legislation establishing or revising Federal programs containing Federal mandates affecting State, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector by—
<br>
<br>(A) providing for the development of information about the nature and size of mandates in proposed legislation; and
<br>
<br>(B) establishing a mechanism to bring such information to the attention of the Senate and the House of Representatives before the Senate and the House of Representatives vote on proposed legislation;
<br>
<br>(4) to promote informed and deliberate decisions by Congress on the appropriateness of Federal mandates in any particular instance;
<br>
<br>(5) to require that Congress consider whether to provide funding to assist State, local, and tribal governments in complying with Federal mandates, to require analyses of the impact of private sector mandates, and through the dissemination of that information provide informed and deliberate decisions by Congress and Federal agencies and retain competitive balance between the public and private sectors;
<br>
<br>(6) to establish a point-of-order vote on the consideration in the Senate and House of Representatives of legislation containing significant Federal intergovernmental mandates without providing adequate funding to comply with such mandates;
<br>
<br>(7) to assist Federal agencies in their consideration of proposed regulations affecting State, local, and tribal governments, by—
<br>
<br>(A) requiring that Federal agencies develop a process to enable the elected and other officials of State, local, and tribal governments to provide input when Federal agencies are developing regulations; and
<br>
<br>(B) requiring that Federal agencies prepare and consider estimates of the budgetary impact of regulations containing Federal mandates upon State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector before adopting such regulations, and ensuring that small governments are given special consideration in that process; and
<br>
<br>(8) to begin consideration of the effect of previously imposed Federal mandates, including the impact on State, local, and tribal governments of Federal court interpretations of Federal statutes and regulations that impose Federal intergovernmental mandates.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REFORM
<br>§1511. Cost of regulations
<br>(a) Sense of Congress

<br>§1513. Impact on local governments
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Senate finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs from Federal to State and local authorities and should be equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to shift costs to local governments;
<br>
<br>(2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in many instances, forced local governments to raise property taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and
<br>
<br>(3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, secure community.
<br>(b) Sense of Senate
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Senate that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting costs to local governments, which forces many local governments to increase property taxes;
<br>
<br>(2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, in a manner that may displace other essential government priorities; and
<br>
<br>(3) one primary objective of this chapter and other efforts to change the relationship among Federal, State, and local governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one level of government to another with little or no benefit to taxpayers.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise prohibited by law, before promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking that is likely to result in promulgation of any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any 1 year, and before promulgating any final rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was published, the agency shall prepare a written statement containing—

<br>The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations shall in accordance with this section—
<br>
<br>(1) investigate and review the role of Federal mandates in intergovernmental relations and their impact on State, local, tribal, and Federal government objectives and responsibilities, and their impact on the competitive balance between State, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector and consider views of and the impact on working men and women on those same matters;
<br>
<br>(2) investigate and review the role of unfunded State mandates imposed on local governments;
<br>
<br>(3) make recommendations to the President and the Congress regarding—

<br>(B) reconciling any 2 or more Federal mandates which impose contradictory or inconsistent requirements;
<br>
<br>(C) terminating Federal mandates which are duplicative, obsolete, or lacking in practical utility;

<br>
<br>(E) consolidating or simplifying Federal mandates, or the planning or reporting requirements of such mandates, in order to reduce duplication and facilitate compliance by State, local, and tribal governments with those mandates;
<br>
<br>(F) establishing common Federal definitions or standards to be used by State, local, and tribal governments in complying with Federal mandates that use different definitions or standards for the same terms or principles; and
<br>
<br>(G)(i) the mitigation of negative impacts on the private sector that may result from relieving State, local, and tribal governments from Federal mandates (if and to the extent that such negative impacts exist on the private sector); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the feasibility of applying relief from Federal mandates in the same manner and to the same extent to private sector entities as such relief is applied to State, local, and tribal governments; and
<br>
<br>(4) identify and consider in each recommendation made under paragraph (3), to the extent practicable—
<br>
<br>(A) the specific Federal mandates to which the recommendation applies, including requirements of the departments, agencies, and other entities of the Federal Government that State, local, and tribal governments utilize metric systems of measurement; and
