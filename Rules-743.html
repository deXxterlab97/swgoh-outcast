<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>Whenever any person knowingly and materially violates any of the provisions of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this chapter, the Director may impose a civil money penalty on such person in accordance with the provisions of this section. The penalty shall be in addition to any other available civil remedy or any available criminal penalty, and may be imposed whether or not the Director imposes other administrative sanctions.
<br>(2) Amount of penalty
<br>
<br>The amount of the penalty, as determined by the Director, may not exceed $1,000 for each violation, except that the maximum penalty for all violations by a particular person during any 1-year period shall not exceed $1,000,000. Each violation of this chapter, or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this chapter, shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each sale or lease or offer to sell or lease. In the case of a continuing violation, as determined by the Director, each day shall constitute a separate violation.
<br>(b) Agency procedures
<br>(1) Establishment
<br>
<br>The Director shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (a). The standards and procedures—
<br>
<br>(A) shall provide for the imposition of a penalty only after a person has been given an opportunity for a hearing on the record; and
<br>
<br>(B) may provide for review by the Director of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.
<br>(2) Final orders
<br>
<br>If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Director reviews the determination or order, the Director may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Director does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.
<br>(3) Factors in determining amount of penalty
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (a), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Director may determine in regulations to be appropriate.
<br>(4) Reviewability of imposition of penalty
<br>
<br>The Secretary's 1 determination or order imposing a penalty under subsection (a) shall not be subject to review, except as provided in subsection (c).
<br>(c) Judicial review of agency determination
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After exhausting all administrative remedies established by the Director under subsection (b)(1), a person aggrieved by a final order of the Director assessing a penalty under this section may seek judicial review pursuant to section 1710 of this title.
<br>(2) Order to pay penalty
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any such review, the court shall have the power to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Director.
<br>(d) Action to collect penalty
<br>
<br>If any person fails to comply with the determination or order of the Director imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (a), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (b) and (c), the Director may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in any appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the person and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the discretion of the court, include any attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's 1 determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.
<br>(e) Settlement by Director
<br>
<br>The Director may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.
<br>(f) "Knowingly" defined
<br>
<br>The term "knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibitions under this section.
<br>(g) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Director shall issue such regulations as the Director deems appropriate to implement this section.
<br>(h) Use of penalties for administration
<br>
<br>Civil money penalties collected under this section shall be paid to the Director and, upon approval in an appropriation Act, may be used by the Director to cover all or part of the cost of rendering services under this chapter.

<br>
<br>(2) horses shown or exhibited which are sore, where such soreness improves the performance of such horse, compete unfairly with horses which are not sore;

<br>
<br>(4) all horses which are subject to regulation under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect such commerce; and
<br>
<br>(5) regulation under this chapter by the Secretary is appropriate to prevent and eliminate burdens upon commerce and to effectively regulate commerce.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 91–540, §3, Dec. 9, 1970, 84 Stat. 1405; Pub. L. 94–360, §4, July 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 915.)
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1976—Pub.

<br>§1823. Horse shows and exhibitions
<br>(a) Disqualification of horses
<br>
<br>The management of any horse show or horse exhibition shall disqualify any horse from being shown or exhibited (1) which is sore or (2) if the management has been notified by a person appointed in accordance with regulations under subsection (c) or by the Secretary that the horse is sore.
<br>(b) Prohibited activities

<br>The management of any horse sale or auction shall prohibit the sale or auction or exhibition for the purpose of sale of any horse (1) which is sore or (2) if the management has been notified by a person appointed in accordance with regulations under subsection (c) or by the Secretary that the horse is sore.

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation requirements for the appointment by the management of any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction of persons qualified to detect and diagnose a horse which is sore or to otherwise inspect horses for the purposes of enforcing this chapter. Such requirements shall prohibit the appointment of persons who, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, have been disqualified by the Secretary to make such detection, diagnosis, or inspection. Appointment of a person in accordance with the requirements prescribed under this subsection shall not be construed as authorizing such person to conduct inspections in a manner other than that prescribed for inspections by the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) under subsection (e).
<br>(d) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements; availability of records
<br>
<br>The management of a horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information as the Secretary may by regulation reasonably require for the purposes of implementing this chapter or to determine compliance with this chapter. Upon request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, such management shall permit entry at all reasonable times for the inspection and copying (on or off the premises) of records required to be maintained under this subsection.

<br>
<br>(2) The attendance of witnesses, and the production of books, papers, and documents, may be required at any designated place from any place in the United States.

<br>No provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any State on the same subject matter, unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision and the law of the State so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed to exclude the Federal Government from enforcing the provision of this chapter within any State, whether or not such State has enacted legislation on the same subject, it being the intent of the Congress to establish concurrent jurisdiction with the States over such subject matter. In no case shall any such State take any action pursuant to this section involving a violation of any such law of that State which would preclude the United States from enforcing the provisions of this chapter against any person.

<br>"Sec. 101. Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. (a) Short Title.—This chapter may be cited as the 'Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Congressional Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States steel industry has been severely harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of steel imports into the United States since 1998, caused by the world financial crisis;
<br>
<br>"(2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 steel worker jobs since 1998, and was the imminent cause of three bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;
<br>
<br>"(3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel companies into—
<br>
<br>"(A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and
<br>
<br>"(B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations and reinvestment in facilities;
<br>
<br>"(4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United States steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in facilities;
<br>
<br>"(5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential health, education, and municipal services that these government entities provide to their citizens; and
<br>
<br>"(6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness of the United States in order to have sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, and armaments necessary for the national defense.

<br>
<br>"Sec. 201. Petroleum Development Management. (a) Short Title.—This chapter may be cited as the 'Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program Act'.

<br>"(2) the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this tally began;
<br>
<br>"(3) if prices do not increase soon, the United States could lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi Arabia;
<br>
<br>"(4) oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at least several years;
<br>
<br>"(5) declining production, well abandonment, and greatly reduced exploration and development are shrinking the domestic oil and gas industry;
<br>
<br>"(6) the world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle East are experiencing increasingly greater political instability;
<br>
<br>"(7) United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous power;
<br>
<br>"(8) reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;
<br>
<br>"(9) the level of United States oil security is directly related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; and

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–70, §3, Aug. 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 178.)
<br>§1843. Limitations and conditions of loan guarantees
<br>(a) Necessary findings
<br>
<br>A guarantee of a loan may be made under this chapter only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the Board finds that (A) the loan is needed to enable the borrower to continue to furnish goods or services and failure to meet this need would adversely and seriously affect the economy of or employment in the Nation or any region thereof, (B) credit is not otherwise available to the borrower under reasonable terms or conditions, and (C) the prospective earning power of the borrower, together with the character and value of the security pledged, furnish reasonable assurance that it will be able to repay the loan within the time fixed, and afford reasonable protection to the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) the lender certifies that it would not make the loan without such guarantee.
<br>(b) Term of loans; renewal
<br>
<br>Loans guaranteed under this chapter shall be payable in not more than five years, but may be renewable for not more than an additional three years.
<br>(c) Interest rates, determination; guarantee fee
<br>
<br>(1) Loans guaranteed under this chapter shall bear interest payable to the lending institutions at rates determined by the Board taking into account the reduction in risk afforded by the loan guarantee and rates charged by lending institutions on otherwise comparable loans.
<br>
<br>(2) The Board shall prescribe and collect a guarantee fee in connection with each loan guaranteed under this chapter. Such fee shall reflect the Government's administrative expense in making the guarantee and the risk assumed by the Government and shall not be less than an amount which, when added to the amount of interest payable to the lender of such loan, produces a total charge appropriate for loan agreements of comparable risk and maturity if supplied by the normal capital markets.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–70, §4, Aug. 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 178.)
<br>§1844. Security for loan guarantees
<br>
<br>In negotiating a loan guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall make every effort to arrange that the payment of the principal of and interest on any plan guaranteed shall be secured by sufficient property of the enterprise to collateralize fully the amount of the loan guarantee.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–70, §5, Aug. 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 179.)
<br>§1845. Requirements applicable to loan guarantees
<br>(a) Stock dividends or other payments, prohibition; waiver
<br>
<br>A guarantee agreement made under this chapter with respect to an enterprise shall require that while there is any principal or interest remaining unpaid on a guaranteed loan to that enterprise the enterprise may not—
<br>
<br>(1) declare a dividend on its common stock; or
<br>
<br>(2) make any payment on its other indebtedness to a lender whose loan has been guaranteed under this chapter.
<br>
<br>The Board may waive either or both of the requirements set forth in this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee.
<br>(b) Managerial changes
<br>
<br>If the Board determines that the inability of an enterprise to obtain credit without a guarantee under this chapter is the result of a failure on the part of management to exercise reasonable business prudence in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, the Board shall require before guaranteeing any loan to the enterprise that the enterprise make such management changes as the Board deems necessary to give the enterprise a sound managerial base.
<br>(c) Financial statement; access to documents
<br>
<br>A guarantee of a loan to any enterprise shall not be made under this chapter unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the Board has received an audited financial statement of the enterprise; and
<br>
<br>(2) the enterprise permits the Board to have the same access to its books and other documents as the Board would have under section 1846 of this title in the event the loan is guaranteed.
<br>(d) Exhaustion of remedies
<br>
<br>No payment shall be made or become due under a guarantee entered into under this chapter unless the lender has exhausted any remedies which it may have under the guarantee agreement.
<br>(e) Protective provisions; advances
<br>
<br>(1) Prior to making any guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall satisfy itself that the underlying loan agreement on which the guarantee is sought contains all the affirmative and negative covenants and other protective provisions which are usual and customary in loan agreements of a similar kind, including previous loan agreements between the lender and the borrower, and that it cannot be amended, or any provisions waived, without the Board's prior consent.
<br>
<br>(2) On each occasion when the borrower seeks an advance under the loan agreement, the guarantee authorized by this chapter shall be in force as to the funds advanced only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the lender gives the Board at least ten days' notice in writing of its intent to provide the borrower with funds pursuant to the loan agreement;
<br>
<br>(B) the lender certifies to the Board before an advance is made that, as of the date of the notice provided for in subparagraph (A), the borrower is not in default under the loan agreement: Provided, That if a default has occurred the lender shall report the facts and circumstances relating thereto to the Board and the Board may expressly and in writing waive such default in any case where it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee; and
<br>
<br>(C) the borrower provides the Board with a plan setting forth the expenditures for which the advance will be used and the period during which the expenditures will be made, and, upon the expiration of such periods, reports to the Board any instances in which amounts advanced have not been expended in accordance with the plan.
<br>(f) Loan security, priority; collateral
<br>
<br>(1) A guarantee agreement made under this chapter shall contain a requirement that as between the Board and the lender, the Board shall have a priority with respect to, and to the extent of, the lender's interest in any collateral securing the loan and any earlier outstanding loans.
