<br>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him
<br>That bringeth good tidings, that announceth peace!
<br>Keep thy feasts, O Judah, Perform thy vows;
<br>For the wicked one shall no more pass through thee;
<br>He is utterly cut off.
<br> 
<br>2A maul is come up before thy face; Guard the defences,
<br>Watch the way, make thy loins strong,
<br>Fortify thy power mightily!—
<br>3For the LORD restoreth the pride of Jacob,
<br>As the pride of Israel;
<br>For the emptiers have emptied them out,
<br>And marred their vine-branches.—
<br>4The shield of his mighty men is made red,
<br>The valiant men are in scarlet;
<br>The chariots are fire of steel in the day of his preparation,
<br>And the cypress spears are made to quiver.
<br>5The chariots rush madly in the streets,
<br>They jostle one against another in the broad places;
<br>The appearance of them is like torches,
<br>They run to and fro like the lightnings.
<br>
<br>6He bethinketh himself of his worthies;
<br>They stumble in their march;
<br>They make haste to the wall thereof, And the mantelet is prepared.
<br>7The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved.
<br>8And the queen is uncovered, she is carried away,
<br>And her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves,
<br>Tabering upon their breasts.
<br> 
<br>
<br>9But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water;
<br>Yet they flee away; ‘Stand, stand’;
<br>But none looketh back.
<br>10Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold;
<br>For there is no end of the store, Rich with all precious vessels. 11She is empty, and void, and waste;
<br>And the heart melteth, and the knees smite together,
<br>And convulsion is in all loins,
<br>And the faces of them all have gathered blackness.
<br>
<br>12Where is the den of the lions,
<br>Which was the feeding-place of the young lions,
<br>Where the lion and the lioness walked, and the lion’s whelp,
<br>And none made them afraid?
<br>13The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps,
<br>And strangled for his lionesses, And filled his caves with prey, And his dens with ravin.
<br>14Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>And I will burn her chariots in the smoke,
<br>And the sword shall devour thy young lions;
<br>And I will cut off thy prey from the earth,
<br>And the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
<br> 
<br>Woe to the bloody city!
<br>It is all full of lies and rapine; The prey departeth not.
<br>2Hark! the whip, and hark! the rattling of the wheels;
<br>And prancing horses, and bounding chariots;
<br>3The horseman charging,
<br>And the flashing sword, and the glittering spear;
<br>And a multitude of slain, and a heap of carcases;
<br>And there is no end of the corpses, and they stumble upon their corpses;
<br>4Because of the multitude of the harlotries of the well-favoured harlot,
<br>The mistress of witchcrafts,
<br>That selleth nations through her harlotries,
<br>And families through her witchcrafts.
<br>5Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>And I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face,
<br>And I will shew the nations thy nakedness,
<br>And the kingdoms thy shame.
<br>6And I will cast detestable things upon thee, and make thee vile,
<br>And will make thee as dung.
<br>7And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
<br>Shall flee from thee,
<br>And say: ‘Nineveh is laid waste; Who will bemoan her?
<br> 
<br>Whence shall I seek comforters for thee?’
<br>8Art thou better than No-amon, That was situate among the rivers,
<br>That had the waters round about her;
<br>Whose rampart was the sea, and of the sea her wall?
<br>9Ethiopia and Egypt were thy strength, and it was infinite;
<br>Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
<br>10Yet was she carried away, She went into captivity;
<br>Her young children also were dashed in pieces
<br>At the head of all the streets;
<br>And they cast lots for her honourable men,
<br>And all her great men were bound in chains.
<br>11Thou also shalt be drunken, Thou shalt swoon;
<br>Thou also shalt seek a refuge Because of the enemy.
<br>
<br>12All thy fortresses shall be like fig- trees with the first-ripe figs:
<br>If they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
<br>13Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women;
<br>The gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies;
<br>The fire hath devoured thy bars. 14Draw thee water for the siege, Strengthen thy fortresses;
<br> 
<br>Go into the clay, and tread the mortar,
<br>Lay hold of the brickmould. 15There shall the fire devour thee; The sword shall cut thee off,
<br>It shall devour thee like the canker- worm;
<br>Make thyself many as the canker- worm,
<br>Make thyself many as the locusts.
<br>16Thou hast multiplied thy merchants
<br>Above the stars of heaven;
<br>The canker-worm spreadeth itself, and flieth away.
<br>17Thy crowned are as the locusts,
<br>And thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers,
<br>Which camp in the walls in the cold day,
<br>But when the sun ariseth they flee away,
<br>And their place is not known where they are.
<br>18Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria,
<br>Thy worthies are at rest;
<br>Thy people are scattered upon the mountains,
<br>And there is none to gather them. 19There is no assuaging of thy hurt, Thy wound is grievous;
<br>All that hear the report of thee Clap the hands over thee;
<br>For upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

<br>HABAKKUK
<br> 
<br>THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
<br>
<br>2How long, O LORD, shall I cry, And Thou wilt not hear?
<br>I cry out unto Thee of violence, And Thou wilt not save.
<br>3Why dost Thou show me iniquity, And beholdest mischief?
<br>And why are spoiling and violence before me?
<br>So that there is strife, and contention ariseth.
<br>4Therefore the law is slacked, And right doth never go forth;
<br>For the wicked doth beset the righteous;
<br>Therefore right goeth forth perverted.
<br>
<br>5Look ye among the nations, and behold,
<br>And wonder marvellously; For, behold, a work shall be wrought in your days,
<br>Which ye will not believe though it be told you.
<br>6For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, That bitter and impetuous nation,
<br>That march through the breadth of the earth,
<br>To possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
<br>7They are terrible and dreadful;
<br> 
<br>Their law and their majesty proceed from themselves.
<br>8Their horses also are swifter than leopards,
<br>And are more fierce than the wolves of the desert;
<br>And their horsemen spread themselves;
<br>Yea, their horsemen come from far,
<br>They fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour.
<br>9They come all of them for violence;
<br>Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind;
<br>And they gather captives as the sand.
<br>10And they scoff at kings,
<br>And princes are a derision unto them;
<br>They deride every stronghold,
<br>For they heap up earth, and take it.
<br>11Then their spirit doth pass over and transgress,
<br>And they become guilty:
<br>Even they who impute their might unto their god.
<br>
<br>12Art not Thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die.
<br>O LORD, Thou hast ordained them for judgment,
<br>And Thou, O Rock, hast established them for correction.
<br> 
<br>13Thou that art of eyes too pure to behold evil,
<br>And that canst not look on mischief,
<br>Wherefore lookest Thou, when they deal treacherously,
<br>And holdest Thy peace, when the wicked swalloweth up
<br>The man that is more righteous than he;
<br>14And makest men as the fishes of the sea,
<br>As the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
<br>15They take up all of them with the angle,
<br>They catch them in their net, And gather them in their drag; Therefore they rejoice and exult.
<br>16Therefore they sacrifice unto their net,
<br>And offer unto their drag;
<br>Because by them their portion is fat, And their food plenteous.
<br>17Shall they therefore empty their net,
<br>And not spare to slay the nations continually?
<br>
<br>I will stand upon my watch, And set me upon the tower,
<br>And will look out to see what He will speak by me,
<br>And what I shall answer when I am reproved.
<br>2And the LORD answered me, and said:
<br>‘Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables,
<br>That a man may read it swiftly.
<br> 
<br>3For the vision is yet for the appointed time,
<br>And it declareth of the end, and doth not lie;
<br>Though it tarry, wait for it;
<br>Because it will surely come, it will not delay.’
<br>
<br>4Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him;
<br>But the righteous shall live by his faith.
<br>5Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer;
<br>The haughty man abideth not;
<br>He who enlargeth his desire as the nether-world,
<br>And is as death, and cannot be satisfied,
<br>But gathereth unto him all nations, And heapeth unto him all peoples. 6Shall not all these take up a parable
<br>against him,
<br>And a taunting riddle against him,
<br>And say: ‘Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his!
<br>How long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges! ’
<br>7Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact interest of thee,
<br>And awake that shall violently shake thee,
<br>And thou shalt be for booties unto them?
<br>8Because thou hast spoiled many nations,
<br>All the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee;
<br> 
<br>Because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land,
<br>To the city and to all that dwell therein.
<br>
<br>9Woe to him that gaineth evil gains for his house,
<br>That he may set his nest on high,
<br>That he may be delivered from the power of evil!
<br>10Thou hast devised shame to thy house,
<br>By cutting off many peoples, And hast forfeited thy life.
<br>11For the stone shall cry out of the wall,
<br>And the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
<br>
<br>12Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood,
<br>And establisheth a city by iniquity!
<br>13Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts
<br>That the peoples labour for the fire,
<br>And the nations weary themselves for vanity?
<br>14For the earth shall be filled
<br>With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD,
<br>As the waters cover the sea.
<br>
<br>15Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink,
<br>That puttest thy venom thereto, and makest him drunken also,
<br>That thou mayest look on their nakedness!
<br> 
<br>16Thou art filled with shame instead of glory,
<br>Drink thou also, and be uncovered;
<br>The cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee,
<br>And filthiness shall be upon thy glory.
<br>17For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee,
<br>And the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid;
<br>Because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land,
<br>To the city and to all that dwell therein.
<br>
<br>18What profiteth the graven image,
<br>That the maker thereof hath graven it,
<br>Even the molten image, and the teacher of lies;
<br>That the maker of his work trusteth therein,
<br>To make dumb idols?
<br>19Woe unto him that saith to the wood: ‘Awake’,
<br>To the dumb stone: ‘Arise! ’ Can this teach?
<br>Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,
<br>And there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
<br>20But the LORD is in His holy temple; Let all the earth keep silence before
<br>Him.
<br>
<br>A	prayer	of	Habakkuk	the prophet. Upon Shigionoth.
<br> 
<br>2O LORD, I have heard the report of Thee, and am afraid;
<br>O LORD, revive Thy work in the midst of the years,
<br>In the midst of the years make it known;
<br>In wrath remember compassion.
<br>3God cometh from Teman, And the Holy One from mount
<br>Paran.	Selah
<br>His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise. 4And a brightness appeareth as the
<br>light;
<br>Rays hath He at His side;
<br>And there is the hiding of His power.
<br>5Before him goeth the pestilence, And fiery bolts go forth at His feet. 6He standeth, and shaketh the earth,
<br>He beholdeth, and maketh the nations to tremble;
<br>And the everlasting mountains are dashed in pieces,
<br>The ancient hills do bow; His goings are as of old.
<br>7I see the tents of Cushan in affliction;
<br>The curtains of the land of Midian do tremble.
<br>8Is it, O LORD, that against the rivers,
<br>Is it that Thine anger is kindled against the rivers,
<br>Or Thy wrath against the sea?
<br>That Thou dost ride upon Thy horses,
<br>Upon Thy chariots of victory? 9Thy bow is made quite bare; Sworn are the rods of the word.
<br> 
<br>Selah.
<br>Thou dost cleave the earth with rivers.
<br>10The mountains have seen Thee, and they tremble;
<br>The tempest of waters floweth over; the deep uttereth its voice,
<br>And lifteth up its hands on high.
<br>11The sun and moon stand still in their habitation;
<br>At the light of Thine arrows as they go,
<br>At the shining of Thy glittering spear.
<br>12Thou marchest through the earth in indignation,
<br>Thou threshest the nations in anger.
<br>13Thou art come forth for the deliverance of Thy people,
<br>For the deliverance of Thine anointed;
<br>Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked,
<br>Uncovering the foundation even unto the neck.	Selah 14Thou hast stricken through with
<br>his own rods the head of his rulers,
<br>That come as a whirlwind to scatter me;
<br>Whose rejoicing is as to devour the poor secretly.
<br>15Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses,
<br>The foaming of mighty waters.
<br>16When I heard, mine inward parts trembled,
<br>My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones,
<br> 
<br>And I tremble where I stand;
<br>That I should wait for the day of trouble,
<br>When he cometh up against the people that he invadeth.
<br>17For though the fig-tree shall not blossom,
<br>Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food;
<br>The flock shall be cut off from the fold,
<br> 
<br>And there shall be no herd in the stalls;
<br>18Yet I will rejoice in the LORD,
<br>I will exult in the God of my salvation.
<br>19God, the Lord, is my strength,
<br>And He maketh my feet like hinds’feet,
<br>And He maketh me to walk upon my high places.

<br>ZEPHANIAH
<br> 
<br>The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi,
<br>the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
<br>
<br>2I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the earth,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>3I will consume man and beast,
<br>I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea,
<br>And the stumblingblocks with the wicked;
<br>And I will cut off man from off the face of the earth,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>4And I will stretch out My hand upon Judah,
<br>And upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
<br>And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place,
<br>And the name of the idolatrous priests with the priests;
<br>5And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
<br>And them that worship, that swear to the LORD
<br>And swear by Malcam;
<br>6Them also that are turned back from following the LORD;
<br>And those that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired after Him.
<br> 
<br>7Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD;
<br>For the day of the LORD is at hand,
<br>For the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
<br>He hath consecrated His guests.
<br>8And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD’S sacrifice,
<br>That I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons,
<br>And all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
<br>9In the same day also will I punish all those that leap over the threshold,
<br>That fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.
<br>
<br>10And in that day, saith the LORD, Hark! a cry from the fish gate,
<br>And a wailing from the second quarter,
<br>And a great crashing from the hills.
<br>11Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh,
<br>For all the merchant people are undone;
<br>All they that were laden with silver are cut off.
<br>12And it shall come to pass at that time,
<br>That I will search Jerusalem with lamps;
<br>And I will punish the men that are settled on their lees,
<br>That say in their heart:
<br>‘The LORD will not do good, neither will He do evil.’
<br>13Therefore their wealth shall become a booty,
<br> 
<br>And their houses a desolation;
<br>Yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them,
<br>And they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof. 14The great day of the LORD is near,
<br>It is near and hasteth greatly, Even the voice of the day of the
<br>LORD,
<br>Wherein the mighty man crieth bitterly.
<br>15That day is a day of wrath, A day of trouble and distress,
<br>A day of wasteness and desolation, A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness, 16A day of the horn and alarm,
<br>Against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.
<br>17And I will bring distress upon men,
<br>That they shall walk like the blind,
<br>Because they have sinned against the LORD;
<br>And their blood shall be poured out as dust,
<br>And their flesh as dung.
<br>18Neither their silver nor their gold Shall be able to deliver them
<br>In the day of the LORD’S wrath;
<br>But the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy;
<br>For He will make and end, yea, a terrible end,
<br>Of all them that dwell in the earth.
<br>
<br>Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together,
<br> 
<br>O shameless nation;
<br>2Before the decree bring forth The day when one passeth as the
<br>chaff,
<br>Before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you,
<br>Before the day of the LORD’S anger come upon you.
<br>3Seek ye the LORD, all ye humble of the earth,
<br>That have executed His ordinance; Seek righteousness, seek humility.
<br>It may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD’S anger.
<br>4For Gaza shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon a desolation;
<br>They shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday,
<br>And Ekron shall be rooted up.
<br>5Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast,
<br>The nation of the Cherethites!
<br>The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, the land of the
<br>Philistines;
<br>I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
<br>6And the sea-coast shall be pastures,
<br>Even meadows for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
<br>7And it shall be a portion for the remnant of the house of Judah,
<br>Whereon they shall feed;
<br>In the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening;
<br>For the LORD their God will remember them,
<br>And turn their captivity.
<br> 
<br>8I have heard the taunt of Moab, And the revilings of the children of
<br>Ammon,
<br>Wherewith they have taunted My people,
<br>And spoken boastfully concerning their border.
<br>9Therefore as I live,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, And the children of Ammon as
<br>Gomorrah,
<br>Even the breeding-place of nettles, and saltpits,
<br>And a desolation, for ever;
<br>The residue of My people shall spoil them,
<br>And the remnant of My nation shall inherit them.
<br>10This shall they have for their pride,
<br>Because they have taunted and spoken boastfully
<br>Against the people of the LORD of hosts.
<br>11The LORD will be terrible unto them;
<br>For He will famish all the gods of the earth;
<br>Then shall all the isles of the nations worship Him,
<br>Every one from its place.
<br>12Ye Ethiopians also,
<br>Ye shall be slain by My sword.
<br>
<br>13And He will stretch out His hand against the north,
<br>And destroy Assyria;
<br> 
<br>And will make Nineveh a desolation,
<br>And dry like the wilderness.
<br>14And all beasts of every kind
<br>Shall lie down in the midst of her in herds;
<br>Both the pelican and the bittern Shall lodge in the capitals thereof; Voices shall sing in the windows; Desolation shall be in the posts;
<br>For the cedar-work thereof shall be uncovered.
<br>15This is the joyous city That dwelt without care, That said in her heart:
<br>‘I am, and there is none else beside me’;
<br>How is she become a desolation, A place for beasts to lie down in! Every one that passeth by her Shall hiss, and wag his hand.
<br>
<br>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted,
<br>To the oppressing city!
<br>2She hearkened not the voice, She received not correction; She trusted not in the LORD, She drew not near to her God.
<br>3Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions;
<br>Her judges are wolves of the desert,
<br>They leave not a bone for the morrow.
<br>4Her prophets are wanton And treacherous persons;
<br>Her priests have profaned that which is holy,
<br>They have done violence to the law.
<br> 
<br>5The LORD who is righteous is in the midst of her,
<br>He will not do unrighteousness;
<br>Every morning doth He bring His right to light,
<br>It faileth not;
<br>But the unrighteous knoweth no shame.
<br>6I have cut off nations, Their corners are desolate;
<br>I have made their streets waste, So that none passeth by;
<br>Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man,
<br>So that there is no inhabitant.
<br>7I said: ‘Surely thou wilt fear Me, Thou wilt receive correction;
<br>So her dwelling shall not be cut off,
<br>Despite all that I have visited upon her’;
<br>But they betimes corrupted all their doings.
<br>
<br>8Therefore wait ye for Me, saith the LORD,
<br>Until the day that I rise up to the prey;
<br>For My determination is to gather the nations,
<br>That I may assemble the kingdoms,
<br>To pour upon them Mine indignation,
<br>Even all My fierce anger;
<br>For all the earth shall be devoured With the fire of My jealousy.
<br>9For then will I turn to the peoples A pure language,
<br>That they may all call upon the name of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>To serve Him with one consent. 10From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia Shall they bring My suppliants, Even the daughter of My dispersed, As Mine offering.
<br>11In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
<br>Wherein thou hast transgressed against Me;
<br>For then I will take away out of the midst of thee
<br>Thy proudly exulting ones,
<br>And thou shalt no more be haughty In My holy mountain.
<br>12And I will leave in the midst of thee
<br>An afflicted and poor people,
<br>And they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD.
<br>13The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity,
<br>Nor speak lies,
<br>Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth;
<br>For they shall feed and lie down, And none shall make them afraid.
<br>
<br>14Sing, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O Israel;
<br>Be glad and rejoice with all the heart,
<br>O daughter of Jerusalem.
<br>15The LORD hath taken away thy judgments,
<br>He hath cast out thine enemy;
<br> 
<br>The King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee;
<br>Thou shalt not fear evil any more.
<br>16In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
<br>‘Fear thou not;
<br>O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
<br>17The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee,
<br>A Mighty One who will save;
<br>He will rejoice over thee with joy, He will be silent in His love,
<br>He will joy over thee with singing.’ 18I will gather them that are far from the appointed season, who are of
<br>thee,
<br>That hast borne the burden of reproach.
<br>19Behold, at that time
<br>I will deal with all them that afflict thee;
<br>And I will save her that is lame,
<br>And gather her that was driven away;
<br>And I will make them to be a praise and a name,
<br>Whose shame hath been in all the earth.
<br>20At that time will I bring you in, And at that time will I gather you;
<br>For I will make you to be a name and a praise
<br>Among all the peoples of the earth,
<br>When I turn your captivity before your eyes,
<br>Saith the LORD.

<br>HAGGAI
<br> 
<br>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
<br>first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying: 2’Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: This people say: The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built.’ 3Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying: 4’Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your cieled houses, while this house lieth waste? 5Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Consider your ways.
<br>6Ye have sown much, and brought in little,
<br>Ye eat, but ye have not enough,
<br>Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink,
<br>Ye clothe you, but there is none warm;
<br>And he that earneth wages earneth wages
<br>For a bag with holes.
<br>7Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. 8Go up to the hill- country, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. 9Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came
<br> 
<br>to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house. 10Therefore over you the heaven hath kept back, so that there is no dew, and the earth hath kept back her produce. 11And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.’
<br>12Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of the LORD their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people did fear before the LORD. 13Then spoke Haggai the LORD’S messenger in the LORD’S message unto the people, saying: ‘I am with you, saith the LORD.’ 14And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, 15in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the
<br> 
<br>sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
<br>In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying: 2’Speak now to Zerubbabel	the	son	of	Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying: 3Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is not such a one as nothing in your eyes? 4Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work; for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts. 5The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt have I established, and My spirit abideth among you; fear ye not. 6For thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; 7and I will shake all nations, and the choicest things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. 8Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the LORD of hosts. 9The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, saith the LORD of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of
<br>hosts.’
<br>10In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of
<br> 
<br>Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying: 11’Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Ask now the priests for instruction, saying: 12If one bear hallowed flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy?’ And the priests answered and said: ‘No.’ 13Then said Haggai: ‘If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?’ And the priests answered and said: ‘It shall be unclean.’ 14Then answered Haggai, and said: ‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. 15And now, I pray you, consider from this day and forward— before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD, 16through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty; 17I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye turned not to Me, saith the LORD—18consider, I pray you, from this day and forward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD’S temple was laid, consider it; 19is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig- tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree hath not brought forth— from this day will I bless you.’
<br> 
<br>20And the word of the LORD   came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying: 21’Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying: I will shake the heavens and the earth; 22and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will
<br> 
<br>overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 23In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.’

<br>זכריה
<br>ZECHARIAH
<br> 
<br>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of
<br>the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: 2’The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers. 3Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Return unto Me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. 4Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor attend unto Me, saith the LORD. 5Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 6But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? so that they turned and said: Like as the LORD of hosts purposed to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath He dealt with us.’
<br>7Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying— 8I saw in the night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood
<br> 
<br>among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. 9Then said I: ‘O my lord, what are these?’ And the angel that spoke with me said unto me: ‘I will show thee what these are.’ 10And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said: ‘These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.’ 11And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said: ‘We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.’ 12Then the angel of the LORD spoke and said: ‘O LORD of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which Thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 13And the LORD answered the angel that spoke with me with good words, even comforting words—14so the angel that spoke with me said unto me: ‘Proclaim thou, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy; 15and I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped for evil. 16Therefore thus saith the LORD: I return to Jerusalem with compassions:
<br> 
<br>My house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem. 17Again, proclaim, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.’
<br>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 2And
<br>I said unto the angel that spoke with me: ‘What are these?’ And he said unto me: ‘These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.’
<br>3And the LORD showed me four craftsmen. 4Then said I: ‘What come these to do?’ And he spoke, saying: ‘These—the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head—these then are come to frighten them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.’
<br>5And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 6Then said I: ‘Whither goest thou?’ And he said unto me: ‘To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.’ 7And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 8and said unto him: ‘Run, speak to this young man, saying: ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein. 9For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her
<br> 
<br>a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
<br>10Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 11Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.’
<br>12For thus saith the LORD of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: ‘Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 13For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them’; and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
<br>14’Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 15And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee’; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 16 And the LORD shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 17Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused out of His holy habitation.
<br>And he showed me Joshua the high priest   standing before   the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. 2And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan, yea, the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; is not this man a brand plucked
<br> 
<br>out of the fire?’ 3Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 4And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying: ‘Take the filthy garments from off him.’ And unto him he said: ‘Behold, I cause thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with robes.’ 5And I said: ‘Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.’ So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD stood by. 6And the angel of the LORD forewarned Joshua, saying: 7’Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If thou wilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, and wilt also judge My house, and wilt also keep My courts, then I will give thee free access among these that stand by. 8Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign; for, behold, I will bring forth My servant the Shoot. 9For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone are seven facets; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts: And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 10In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.
<br>And the angel that spoke with me returned, and waked me, as a man
<br>that is wakened out of his sleep. 2And he said unto me: ‘What seest thou?’ And I said: ‘I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl
<br> 
<br>upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes, yea, seven, to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof; 3and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.’ 4And I answered and spoke to the angel that spoke with me, saying: ‘What are these, my lord?’ 5Then the angel that spoke with me answered and said unto me: ‘Knowest thou not what these are?’ And I said: ‘No, my lord.’ 6Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying: ‘This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 7Who art thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel? thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.’
<br>8Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying: 9’The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. 10For who hath despised the day of small things? even they shall see with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, even these seven, which are the eyes of the LORD, that run to and fro through the whole earth.’
<br>11Then answered I, and said unto him: ‘What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?’ 12And I answered the second time, and said
<br> 
<br>unto him: ‘What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?’ 13And he answered me and said: ‘Knowest thou not what these are?’ And I said: ‘No, my lord.’ 14Then said he: ‘These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.’
<br>Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a flying roll. 2And he said unto me: ‘What seest thou?’ And I answered: ‘I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.’ 3Then said he unto me: ‘This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land; for every one that stealeth shall be swept away on the one side like it; and every one that sweareth shall be swept away on the other side like it. 4I cause it to go forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his  house, and  shall consume it with the timber thereof and
<br>the stones thereof.’
<br>5Then the angel that spoke with me went forth, and said unto me: ‘Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.’ 6And I said: ‘What is it?’ And he said: ‘This is the measure that goeth forth.’ He said moreover: ‘This is their eye in all the land— 7and, behold, there was lifted up a round piece of lead—and this is a woman sitting in the  midst of the measure.’
<br> 
<br>8And he said: ‘This is Wickedness.’ And he cast her down into the midst of the measure, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
<br>9Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven. 10Then said I to the angel that spoke with me: ‘Whither do these bear the measure?’ 11And he said unto me: ‘To build her a house in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.
<br>And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came
<br>four chariots out from between the two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled bay horses. 4Then I answered and said unto the angel that spoke with me: ‘What are these, my lord?’ 5And the angel answered and said unto me: ‘These chariots go forth to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. 6That wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country; 7and the bay went forth’. And they sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the  earth; and  he  said: ‘Get
<br> 
<br>you hence, walk to and fro through the earth.’ So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8Then cried he upon me, and spoke unto me, saying: ‘Behold, they that go toward the north country have eased My spirit in the north country.’
<br>9And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying: 10’Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, that are come from Babylon; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 11yea, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set the one upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; 12and speak unto him, saying: Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: Behold, a man whose name is the Shoot, and who shall shoot up out of his place, and build the temple of the LORD; 13even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and there shall be a priest before his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 14And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 15And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And it shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your God—.’
<br> 
<br>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word
<br>of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev; 2When Bethel-sarezer, and Regem-melech and his men, had sent to entreat the favour of the LORD, 3and to speak unto the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying: ‘Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?’ 4Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying: 5’Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto Me, even to Me? 6And when ye eat, and when ye did drink, are ye not they that eat, and they that drink? 7Should ye not hearken to the words which the LORD hath proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the Lowland were inhabited?’
<br>8And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying: 9’Thus hath the LORD of hosts spoken, saying: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother; 10and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart. 11But they refused to attend, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and
<br> 
<br>stopped their ears, that they might not hear. 12Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His spirit by the hand of the former prophets; therefore came there great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 13And it came to pass that, as He called, and they would not hear; so they shall call, and I will not hear, said the LORD of hosts; 14but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the pleasant land desolate.’
<br>And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying:   2’Thus   saith   the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous
<br>for her with great fury.
<br>3Thus saith the LORD: I return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts The holy mountain.
<br>4Thus saith the LORD of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age. 5And the broad places of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the broad places thereof.
<br>6Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days,
<br> 
<br>should it also be marvellous in Mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>7Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the east country, and from the west country; 8And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
<br>9Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built. 10For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the adversary; for I set all men every one against his neighbour. 11But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. 12For as the seed of peace, the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. 13And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing; fear not, but let your hands be strong. 14For thus saith the LORD of host: As I purposed to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked Me, saith the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>and I repented not; 15so again do I purpose in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear ye not. 16These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; 17and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.’
<br>18And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying: 19’Thus saith the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful seasons; therefore love ye truth and peace. 20Thus saith the LORD of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities; 21and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying: Let us go speedily to entreat the favour of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will go also. 22Yea, many peoples and mighty nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favour of the LORD. 23Thus saith the LORD of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’
<br> 
<br>The burden of the word of the LORD.
<br>
<br>In the land of Hadrach,
<br>And in Damascus shall be His resting-place;
<br>For the LORD’S is the eye of man And all the tribes of Israel.
<br>2And Hamath also shall border thereon;
<br>Tyre and Zidon, for she is very wise.
<br>3And Tyre did build herself a stronghold,
<br>And heaped up silver as the dust,
<br>And fine gold as the mire of the streets.
<br>4Behold, the Lord will impoverish her,
<br>And He will smite her power into the sea;
<br>And she shall be devoured with fire. 5Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be sore pained,
<br>And Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed;
<br>And the king shall perish from Gaza,
<br>And Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
<br>6And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod,
<br>And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
<br>7And I will take away his blood out of his mouth,
<br>And his detestable things from between his teeth,
<br> 
<br>And he also shall be a remnant for our God;
<br>And he shall be as a chief in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite.
<br>8And I will encamp about My house against the army,
<br>That none pass through or return;
<br>And no oppressor shall pass through them any more;
<br>For now have I seen with Mine eyes.
<br>
<br>9Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion,
<br>Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; Behold, thy king cometh unto thee, He is triumphant, and victorious, Lowly, and riding upon an ass, Even upon a colt the foal of an ass. 10And I will cut off the chariot from
<br>Ephraim,
<br>And the horse from Jerusalem, And the battle bow shall be cut off,
<br>And he shall speak peace unto the nations;
<br>And his dominion shall be from sea to sea,
<br>And from the River to the ends of the earth.
<br>11As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant
<br>I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit
<br>Wherein is no water. 12Return to the stronghold, Ye prisoners of hope; Even to-day do I declare
<br>That I will render double unto thee.
<br>13For I bend Judah for Me,
<br> 
<br>I fill the bow with Ephraim;
<br>And I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy sons, O Javan,
<br>And will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
<br>14And the LORD shall be seen over them,
<br>And His arrow shall go forth as the lightning;
<br>And the Lord GOD will blow the horn,
<br>And will go with whirlwinds of the south.
<br>15The LORD of hosts will defend them;
<br>And they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones;
<br>And they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine;
<br>And they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar.
<br>16And the LORD their God shall save them in that day
<br>As the flock of His people;
<br>For they shall be as the stones of a crown,
<br>Glittering over His land.
<br>17For how great is their goodness, and how great is their beauty!
<br>Corn shall make the young men flourish,
<br>And new wine the maids.
<br>
<br>Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain,
<br>Even of the LORD that maketh lightnings;
<br> 
<br>And He will give them showers of rain,
<br>To every one grass in the field.
<br>2For the teraphim have spoken vanity,
<br>And the diviners have seen a lie, And the dreams speak falsely, They comfort in vain;
<br>Therefore they go their way like sheep,
<br>They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
<br>
<br>3Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds,
<br>And I will punish the he-goats;
<br>For the LORD of hosts hath remembered His flock the house of Judah,
<br>And maketh them as His majestic horse in the battle.
<br>4Out of them shall come forth the corner-stone,
<br>Out of them the stake,
<br>Out of them the battle bow,
<br>Out of them every master together.
<br>5And they shall be as mighty men,
<br>Treading down in the mire of the streets in the battle,
<br>And they shall fight, because the LORD is with them;
<br>And the riders on horses shall be confounded.
<br>6And I will strengthen the house of Judah,
<br>And I will save the house of Joseph,
<br>And I will bring them back, for I have compassion upon them,
<br> 
<br>And they shall be as though I had not cast them off;
<br>For I am the LORD their God, and I will hear them.
<br>7And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man,
<br>And their heart shall rejoice as through wine;
<br>Yea, their children shall see it,
<br>And rejoice, their heart shall be glad in the LORD.
<br>8I will hiss for them, and gather them,
<br>For I have redeemed them;
<br>And they shall increase as they have increased.
<br>9And I will sow them among the peoples,
<br>And they shall remember Me in far countries;
<br>And they shall live with their children, and shall return.
<br>10I will bring them back also out of the land of Egypt,
<br>And gather them out of Assyria;
<br>And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon;
<br>And place shall not suffice them.
<br>11And over the sea affliction shall pass,
<br>And the waves shall be smitten in the sea,
<br>And all the depths of the Nile shall dry up;
<br>And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
<br>And the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
<br> 
<br>12And I will strengthen them in the LORD;
<br>And they shall walk up and down in His name,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Open thy doors, O Lebanon,
<br>That the fire may devour thy cedars.
<br>2Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen;
<br>Because the glorious ones are spoiled;
<br>Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan,
<br>For the strong forest is come down. 3Hark! the wailing of the shepherds, For their glory is spoiled;
<br>Hark! the roaring of young lions,
<br>For the thickets of the Jordan are spoiled.
<br>4Thus said the LORD my God: ‘Feed the flock of slaughter; 5whose buyers slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say: Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not. 6For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.’ 7So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders; and I fed the flock. 8And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; ‘for My soul became impatient of
<br> 
<br>them, and their soul also loathed Me.’ 9Then said I: ‘I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.’ 10And I took my staff Graciousness, and cut it asunder, ‘that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.’ 11And it was broken in that day; and the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew of a truth that it was the word of the LORD. 12And I said unto them: ‘If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear.’ So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver. 13And the LORD said unto me: ‘Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price that I was prized at of them.’ And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the treasury, in the house of the LORD. 14Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Binders, that the brotherhood between Judah and Israel might be broken.
<br>15And the LORD said unto me: ‘Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 16For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not think of those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are young, nor heal that which is broken; neither will he feed that which standeth still, but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and will break their hoofs in pieces.’
<br>17Woe to the worthless shepherd That leaveth the flock!
<br>The sword shall be upon his arm, And upon his right eye;
<br> 
<br>His arm shall be clean dried up,
<br>And his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
<br>
<br>The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
<br>
<br>The saying of the LORD, who stretched forth the heavens,
<br>And laid the foundation of the earth,
<br>And formed the spirit of man within him:
<br>2Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of staggering
<br>Unto all the peoples round about,
<br>And upon Judah also shall it fall to be in the siege against Jerusalem.
<br>3And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden for all the peoples;
<br>All that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded;
<br>And all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
<br>4In that day, saith the LORD,
<br>I will smite every horse with bewilderment,
<br>And his rider with madness;
<br>And I will open Mine eyes upon the house of Judah,
<br>And will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.
<br>5And the chiefs of Judah shall say in their heart:
<br>‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength
<br>Through the LORD of hosts their God.’
<br> 
<br>6In that day will I make the chiefs of Judah
<br>Like a pan of fire among the wood,
<br>And like a torch of fire among sheaves;
<br>And they shall devour all the peoples round about,
<br>On the right hand and on the left; And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>7The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first,
<br>That the glory of the house of David And the glory of the inhabitants of
<br>Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.
<br>8In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
<br>And he that stumbleth among them at that day shall be as David;
<br>And the house of David shall be as a godlike being,
<br>As the angel of the LORD before them.
<br>9And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That I will seek to destroy all the nations
<br>That come against Jerusalem.
<br>10And I will pour upon the house of David,
<br>And upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br>The spirit of grace and of supplication;
<br> 
<br>And they shall look unto Me because athey have thrust him through;
<br>And they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son,
<br>And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
<br>11In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
<br>As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
<br>12And the land shall mourn, every family apart:
<br>The family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart;
<br>The family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
<br>13The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
<br>The family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;
<br>14All the families that remain,
<br>Every family apart, and their wives apart.
<br>
<br>In that day there shall be a fountain opened
<br>To the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br>For purification and for sprinkling.
<br>2And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>That I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, the nations. See verse 9.
<br> 
<br>And they shall no more be remembered;
<br>And also I will cause the prophets And the unclean spirit to pass out of
<br>the land.
<br>3And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begot him shall say unto him: ‘Thou shalt not live, for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD’; and his father and his mother that begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 4And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be brought to shame every one through his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive; 5but he shall say: ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.’ 6And one shall say unto him: ‘What are these wounds between thy hands?’ Then he shall answer: ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’
<br>
<br>7Awake, O sword, against My shepherd,
<br>And against the man that is near unto Me,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts;
<br>Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered;
<br>And I will turn My hand upon the little ones.
<br>8And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD,
<br>Two parts therein shall be cut off and die;
<br> 
<br>But the third shall be left therein.
<br>9And I will bring the third part through the fire,
<br>And will refine them as silver is refined,
<br>And will try them as gold is tried; They shall call on My name,
<br>And I will answer them;
<br>I will say: ‘It is My people’,
<br>And they shall say: ‘The LORD is my God.’
<br>
<br>Behold, a day of the LORD cometh,
<br>When thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
<br>2For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle;
<br>And the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled,
<br>And the women ravished;
<br>And half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
<br>But the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
<br>3Then shall the LORD go forth, And fight against those nations,
<br>As when He fighteth in the day of battle.
<br>4And His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
<br>Which is before Jerusalem on the east,
<br>And the mount of Olives shall cleft in the midst thereof
<br>Toward the east and toward the west,
<br>So that there shall be a very great valley;
<br> 
<br>And half of the mountain shall remove toward the north,
<br>And half of it toward the south.
<br>5And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains;
<br>For the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel;
<br>Yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake
<br>In the days of Uzziah king of Judah; And the LORD my God shall come, And all the holy ones with Thee.
<br>6And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light,
<br>But heavy clouds and thick; 7And there shall be one day Which shall be known as the
<br>LORD’S,
<br>Not day, and not night;
<br>But it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.
<br>8And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That living waters shall go out from Jerusalem:
<br>Half of them toward the eastern sea,
<br>And half of them toward the western sea;
<br>In summer and in winter shall it be.
<br>9And the LORD shall be King over all the earth;
<br>In that day shall the LORD be One, and His name one.
<br>10All the land shall be turned as the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and
<br> 
<br>from the tower of Hananel unto the king’s winepresses.
<br>11And men shall dwell therein,
<br>And there shall be no more extermination;
<br>But Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
<br>
<br>12And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite
<br>All the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem:
<br>Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet,
<br>And their eyes shall consume away in their sockets,
<br>And their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
<br>13And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them;
<br>And they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour,
<br>And his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.
<br>14And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem;
<br>And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together,
<br>Gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
<br>15And so shall be the plague of the horse,
<br> 
<br>Of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass,
<br>And of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as this plague.
<br>
<br>16And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 17And it shall be, that whoso of the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain. 18And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, they shall have no overflow; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 19This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 20In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses: HOLY UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the basins before the altar. 21Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto the LORD of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein; and in that day there shall be no more a trafficker in the house of the LORD of hosts.
<br> 
<br>
<br>מלאכי
<br>MALACHI
<br> 
<br>The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
<br>
<br>2I have loved you, saith the LORD.
<br>Yet ye say: ‘Wherein hast Thou loved us?’
<br>Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? Saith the LORD;
<br>Yet I loved Jacob;
<br>3But Esau I hated,
<br>And made his mountains a desolation,
<br>And gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
<br>4Whereas Edom saith:
<br>‘We are beaten down,
<br>But we will return and build the waste places’;
<br>Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>They shall build, but I will throw down;
<br>And they shall be called The border of wickedness,
<br>And The people whom the LORD execrateth for ever.
<br>5And your eyes shall see, And ye shall say:
<br>‘The LORD is great beyond the border of Israel.’
<br>
<br>6A son honoureth his father, And a servant his master;
<br> 
<br>If then I be a father, Where is My honour? And if I be a master, Where is My fear?
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts
<br>Unto you, O priests, that despise My name.
<br>And ye say: ‘Wherein have we despised Thy name?’
<br>7Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar.
<br>And ye say: ‘Wherein have we polluted thee?’
<br>In that ye say: ‘The table of the LORD is contemptible.’
<br>8And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it no evil!
<br>And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it no evil!
<br>Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee?
<br>Or will he accept thy person? Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>9And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God
<br>That He may be gracious unto us!— This hath been of your doing.— Will He accept any of your persons? Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>10Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors,
<br> 
<br>That ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain!
<br>I have no pleasure in you, Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>Neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
<br>11For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same
<br>My name is great among the nations;
<br>And in every place offerings are presented unto My name,
<br>Even pure oblations;
<br>For My name is great among the nations,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>12But ye profane it, In that ye say:
<br>‘The table of the LORD is polluted,
<br>And the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.’
<br>13Ye say also:
<br>‘Behold, what a weariness is it!’ And ye have snuffed at it,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts;
<br>And ye have brought that which was taken by violence,
<br>And the lame, and the sick; Thus ye bring the offering;
<br>Should I accept this of your hand? Saith the LORD.
<br>14But cursed be he that dealeth craftily,
<br>Whereas he hath in his flock a male,
<br>And voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing;
<br>For I am a great King, Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>And My name is feared among the nations.
<br>
<br>And now, this commandment Is for you, O ye priests.
<br>2If ye will not hearken, and if ye will not lay it to heart,
<br>To give glory unto My name, Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>Then will I send the curse upon you, And I will curse your blessings; Yea, I curse them,
<br>Because ye do not lay it to heart.
<br>3Behold, I will rebuke the seed for your hurt,
<br>And will spread dung upon your faces,
<br>Even the dung of your sacrifices; And ye shall be taken away unto it. 4Know then that I have sent
<br>This commandment unto you, That My covenant might be with
<br>Levi,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>5My covenant was with him
<br>Of life and peace, and I gave them to him,
<br>And of fear, and he feared Me, And was afraid of My name.
<br>6The law of truth was in his mouth,
<br>And unrighteousness was not found in his lips;
<br>He walked with Me in peace and uprightness,
<br>And did turn many away from iniquity.
<br>7For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge,
<br> 
<br>And they should seek the law at his mouth;
<br>For he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
<br>8But ye are turned aside out of the way;
<br>Ye have caused many to stumble in the law;
<br>Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>9Therefore have I also made you Contemptible and base before all the
<br>people,
<br>According as ye have not kept My ways,
<br>But have had respect of persons in the law.
<br>
<br>10Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us?
<br>Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother,
<br>Profaning the covenant of our fathers?
<br>11Judah hath dealt treacherously, And an abomination is committed in
<br>Israel and in Jerusalem;
<br>For Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which He loveth,
<br>And hath married the daughter of a strange god.
<br>12May the LORD cut off to the man that doeth this,
<br>Him that calleth and him that answereth out of the tents of Jacob,
<br> 
<br>And him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.
<br>13And this further ye do:
<br>Ye cover the altar of the LORD with tears,
<br>With weeping, and with sighing,
<br>Insomuch that He regardeth not the offering any more,
<br>Neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.
<br>14Yet ye say: ‘Wherefore?’
<br>Because the LORD hath been witness Between thee and the wife of thy
<br>youth,
<br>Against whom thou hast dealt treacherously,
<br>Though she is thy companion, And the wife of thy covenant. 15And not one hath done so Who had exuberance of spirit! For what seeketh the one?
<br>A seed given of God.
<br>Therefore take heed to your spirit,
<br>And let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
<br>16For I hate putting away,
<br>Saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
<br>And him that covereth his garment with violence,
