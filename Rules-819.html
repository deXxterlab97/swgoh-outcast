<br>
<br>The punishment prescribed by section 545 of this title was inserted to make this section complete without reference to another section. In doing so it was necessary to rephrase the punishment provision of section 545 of this title, as originally enacted, without change of substance.

<br>
<br>Reference to felony, contained in words "such person shall be guilty of a felony" was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in section 1 of this title. This, too, was the policy adopted by the codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code. (See S. Rept. 10, pt. I, pp. 12, 13, and 14, 60th Cong., 1st sess.)

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–127, §2, June 5, 2012, 126 Stat. 370, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Trafficking and smuggling organizations are intensifying their efforts to enter the United States through tunnels and other subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be used to transport people and other contraband.
<br>
<br>"(3) From Fiscal Year 1990 to Fiscal Year 2011, law enforcement authorities discovered 149 cross-border tunnels along the border between Mexico and the United States, 139 of which have been discovered since Fiscal Year 2001. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of cross-border tunnels discovered in Arizona and California since Fiscal Year 2006, with 40 tunnels discovered in California and 74 tunnels discovered in Arizona.
<br>
<br>"(4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109–295) added a new section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), which—
<br>
<br>"(A) criminalizes the construction or financing of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international border into the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage on the person's land.

<br>"(5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial options."

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§209, 212 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§119, 122, 35 Stat. 1110).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates sections 209 and 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change of substance.
<br>
<br>To eliminate ambiguity resulting from use of identical words in reference "officer or employee of the United States mentioned in section 208 of this title" as those appearing in section 208 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 602 of this title, words "person mentioned in section 602 of this title" were inserted.
<br>
<br>Words "from any such person" were inserted after "purpose", so as to make it clear that the section does not embrace State employees in its provisions. Some Federal agencies are located in State buildings occupied by State employees.
<br>
<br>The punishment provision was derived from section 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (See reviser's note under section 602 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
