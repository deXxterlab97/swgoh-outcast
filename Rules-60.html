<br>4	For with thee there is merciful forgiveness: and by reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord. My soul hath relied on his word:
<br>5	my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
<br>6	From the morning watch even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.
<br>7	Because with the Lord there is mercy: and with him plentiful redemption.
<br>8	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniq- uities.
<br>
<br>Chapter 130
<br>A gradual canticle of David. Lord, my heart is not exalted: nor are my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me.
<br>2	If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: As a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul.
<br>3	Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 131
<br>A gradual canticle. O Lord, remember David, and all his meekness.
<br>2	How he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob:
<br>3	If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go up into the bed wherein I lie:
<br> 
<br>4	If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,
<br>5	Or rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
<br>6	Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the fields of the wood.
<br>7	We will go into his tabernacle: we will adore in the place where his feet stood.
<br>8	Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which thou hast sanctified.
<br>9	Let thy priests be clothed with justice: and let thy saints rejoice.
<br>10	For thy servant David’s sake, turn not away the face of thy anointed.
<br>11	The Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not make it void: of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne.
<br>12	If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them: Their children also for evermore shall sit upon thy throne.
<br>13	For the Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for his dwelling.
<br>14	This is my rest for ever and ever: here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.
<br>15	Blessing I will bless her widow: I will sat- isfy her poor with bread.
<br>16	I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with exceeding great joy. 17 There will I bring forth a horn to David: I
<br>have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
<br>18 His enemies I will clothe with confusion: but upon him shall my sanctification flourish.
<br>
<br>Chapter 132
<br>A gradual canticle of David. Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell to-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>gether in unity:
<br>2	Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment:
<br>3	As the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath com- manded blessing, and life for evermore.
<br>
<br>Chapter 133
<br>A gradual canticle. Behold now bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord: Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
<br>2 In the nights lift up your hands to the holy places, and bless ye the Lord.
<br>3 May the Lord out of Sion bless thee, he that made heaven and earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 134
<br>Alleluia. Praise ye the name of the Lord: O you his servants, praise the Lord:
<br>2	You that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
<br>3	Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: sing ye to his name, for it is sweet.
<br>4	For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto him- self: Israel for his own possession.
<br>5	For I have known that the Lord is great, and our God is above all gods.
<br>6	Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done, in heaven, in earth, in the sea, and in all the deeps.
<br>7	He bringeth up clouds from the end of the earth: he hath made lightnings for the rain. He bringeth forth winds out of his stores:
<br>8	He slew the firstborn of Egypt from man even unto beast.
<br> 
<br>9	He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt: upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.
<br>10	He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:
<br>11	Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan.
<br>12	And gave their land for an inheritance, for an inheritance to his people Israel.
<br>13	Thy name, O Lord, is for ever: thy memo- rial, O Lord, unto all generations.
<br>14	For the Lord will judge his people, and will be entreated in favour of his servants.
<br>15	The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of men’s hands.
<br>16	They have a mouth, but they speak not: they have eyes, but they see not.
<br>17	They have ears, but they hear not: neither is there any breath in their mouths.
<br>18	Let them that make them be like to them: and every one that trusteth in them.
<br>19	Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: bless the Lord, O house of Aaron.
<br>20	Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: you that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
<br>21	Blessed be the Lord out of Sion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 135
<br>
<br>Alleluia. Praise the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>2	Praise ye the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<br>4	Who alone doth great wonders:	for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	Who made the heavens in understanding: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>6	Who established the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>7	Who made the great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>8	The sun to rule the day: for his mercy en- dureth for ever.
<br>9	The moon and the stars to rule the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>10	Who smote Egypt with their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>11	Who brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>12	With a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>13	Who divided the Red Sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>14	And brought out Israel through the midst thereof: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>15	And overthrew Pharao and his host in the Red Sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>16	Who led his people through the desert: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>17	Who smote great kings: for his mercy en- dureth for ever.
<br>18	And slew strong kings: for his mercy en- dureth for ever.
<br>19	Sehon king of the Amorrhites:	for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>20	And Og king of Basan: for his mercy en- dureth for ever.
<br>21	And he gave their land for an inheritance: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>22	For an inheritance to his servant Israel: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>23	For he was mindful of us in our affliction: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>24	And he redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>25	Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>26	Give glory to the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>27	Give glory to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 136
<br>Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept: when we remembered Sion:
<br>2	On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments.
<br>3	For there they that led us into captivity re- quired of us the words of songs. And they that carried us away, said: Sing ye to us a hymn of the songs of Sion.
<br>4	How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land?
<br>5	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
<br>6	Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I do not remember thee: If I make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy.
<br>7	Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem: Who say: Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
<br>8	O daughter of Babylon, miserable: blessed shall he be who shall repay thee thy payment which thou hast paid us.
<br>9	Blessed be he that shall take and dash thy little ones against the rock.
<br>
<br>Chapter 137
<br>For David himself. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: for thou hast heard the words of my mouth. I will sing praise to thee in the sight of the angels:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	I will worship towards thy holy temple, and I will give glory to thy name. For thy mercy, and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy holy name above all.
<br>3	In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me: thou shalt multiply strength in my soul.
<br>4 May all the kings of the earth give glory to thee: for they have heard all the words of thy mouth.
<br>5	And let them sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord.
<br>6	For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low: and the high he knoweth afar off.
<br>7	If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken me: and thou hast stretched forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies: and thy right hand hath saved me.
<br>8	The Lord will repay for me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: O despise not the works of thy hands.
<br>
<br>Chapter 138
<br>Unto the end, a psalm of David. Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me:
<br>2	Thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.
<br>3	Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: my path and my line thou hast searched out.
<br>4	And thou hast foreseen all my ways: for there is no speech in my tongue.
<br>5	Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old: thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.
<br>6	Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: it is high, and I cannot reach to it.
<br>7	Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy face?
<br> 
<br>9	If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:
<br>10	Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
<br>11	And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: and night shall be my light in my pleasures. 12 But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light all the day: the darkness
<br>thereof, and the light thereof are alike to thee.
<br>13	For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast protected me from my mother’s womb.
<br>14	I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.
<br>15	My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret: and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.
<br>16	Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written: days shall be formed, and no one in them.
<br>17	But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable: their principality is ex- ceedingly strengthened.
<br>18	I will number them, and they shall be mul- tiplied above the sand, I rose up and am still with thee.
<br>19	If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: ye men of blood, depart from me:
<br>20	Because you say in thought: They shall receive thy cities in vain.
<br>21	Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: and pined away because of thy enemies?
<br>22	I have hated them with a perfect hatred: and they are become enemies to me.
<br>23	Prove me, O God, and know my heart: examine me, and know my paths.
<br>24	And see if there be in me the way of iniq- uity: and lead me in the eternal way.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 139
<br>
<br>Unto the end, a psalm of David.
<br>2	Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: res- cue me from the unjust man.
<br>3	Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: all the day long they designed battles.
<br>4	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the venom of asps is under their lips.
<br>5	Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men deliver me. Who have proposed to supplant my steps:
<br>6	The proud have hidden a net for me. And they have stretched out cords for a snare: they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the way- side.
<br>7	I said to the Lord: Thou art my God: hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication.
<br>8	O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.
<br>9	Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked: they have plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.
<br>10	The head of them compassing me about: the labour of their lips shall overwhelm them.
<br>11	Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down into the fire: in miseries they shall not be able to stand.
<br>12	A man full of tongue shall not be estab- lished in the earth: evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.
<br>13	I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, and will revenge the poor.
<br>14	But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name: and the upright shall dwell with thy countenance.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 140
<br>
<br>I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee.
<br>2	Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sac- rifice.
<br>3	Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my lips.
<br>4	Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of them.
<br>5	The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but let not the oil of the sin- ner fatten my head. For my prayer shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased:
<br>6	Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:
<br>7	As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.
<br>8	But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul. 9 Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of
<br>them that work iniquity.
<br>10 The wicked shall fall in his net: I am alone until I pass.
<br>
<br>Chapter 141
<br>
<br>Of understanding for David, A prayer when he was in the cave. [1 Kings 24.]
<br>2	I cried to the Lord with my voice: with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my trouble:
<br>4	When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths. In this way wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.
<br>5	I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me. Flight hath failed me: and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.
<br>6	I cried to thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
<br>7	Attend to my supplication: for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
<br>8	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the just wait for me, until thou reward me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 142
<br>A psalm of David, when his son Absalom pur- sued him. [2 Kings 17.] Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: hear me in thy justice.
<br>2	And enter not into judgment with thy ser- vant: for in thy sight no man living shall be jus- tified.
<br>3	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath brought down my life to the earth. He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old:
<br>5	I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: I meditated upon the works of thy hands.
<br>6	I stretched forth my hands to thee: my soul is as earth without water unto thee.
<br>7	Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit hath fainted away. Turn not away thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
<br> 
<br>pit.
<br>8	Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee have I hoped. Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: for I have lifted up my soul to thee.
<br>9	Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled:
<br>10	Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good spirit shall lead me into the right land: 11 for thy name’s sake, O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice. Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble:
<br>12 And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies. And thou wilt cut off all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
<br>
<br>Chapter 143
<br>Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war.
<br>2	My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me.
<br>3	Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
<br>4	Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow.
<br>5	Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
<br>6	Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scat- ter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
<br>7	Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children:
<br>8	Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
<br>9	To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
<br>10	Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword:
<br>11	Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:
<br>12	Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:
<br>13	Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep fruitful in young, abound- ing in their goings forth:
<br>14	Their oxen fat. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets.
<br>15	They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 144
<br>Praise, for David himself. I will extol thee, O God my king: and I will bless thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
<br>2	Every day will I bless thee: and I will praise thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
<br>3	Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of his greatness there is no end.
<br>4	Generation and generation shall praise thy works: and they shall declare thy power.
<br>5	They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness: and shall tell thy wondrous works.
<br>6	And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and shall declare thy greatness.
<br>7	They shall publish the memory of the abun- dance of thy sweetness: and shall rejoice in thy
<br> 
<br>justice.

<br>9	The Lord is sweet to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
<br>10	Let all thy works, O lord, praise thee: and let thy saints bless thee.
<br>11	They shall speak of the glory of thy king- dom: and shall tell of thy power:
<br>12	To make thy might known to the sons of men: and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom.
<br>13	Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages: and thy dominion endureth throughout all genera- tions. The Lord is faithful in all his words: and holy in all his works.
<br>14	The Lord lifteth up all that fall: and set- teth up all that are cast down.
<br>15	The eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord: and thou givest them meat in due season.
<br>16	Thou openest thy hand, and fillest with blessing every living creature.
<br>17	The Lord is just in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
<br>18	The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: to all that call upon him in truth.
<br>19	He will do the will of them that fear him: and he will hear their prayer, and save them.
<br>20	The Lord keepeth all them that love him; but all the wicked he will destroy.
<br>21	My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for- ever; yea, for ever and ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 145
<br>2 Praise the Lord, O my soul, in my life I will praise the Lord: I will sing to my God as long as I shall be. Put not your trust in princes:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	In the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.
<br>4	His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth: in that day all their thoughts shall perish.
<br>5	Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
<br>6	Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.
<br>7	Who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong: who giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth them that are fettered:
<br>8	The Lord enlighteneth the blind. The Lord lifteth up them that are cast down: the Lord loveth the just.
<br>9	The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will sup- port the fatherless and the widow: and the ways of sinners he will destroy.
<br>10	The Lord shall reign for ever: thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.

<br>3	Who healeth the broken of heart, and bindeth up their bruises.
<br>4	Who telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
<br>5	Great is our Lord, and great is his power: and of his wisdom there is no number.
<br>6	The Lord lifteth up the meek, and bringeth the wicked down even to the ground.
<br>7	Sing ye to the Lord with praise: sing to our God upon the harp.
<br> 
<br>8	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth. Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains, and herbs for the ser- vice of men.
<br>9	Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young ravens that call upon him.
<br>10	He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.
<br>11	The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him: and in them that hope in his mercy.
<br>
<br>Chapter 147
<br>12	Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
<br>13	Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates, he hath blessed thy children within thee.
<br>14	Who hath placed peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the fat of corn.
<br>15	Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: his word runneth swiftly.
<br>16	Who giveth snow like wool: scattereth mists like ashes.
<br>17	He sendeth his crystal like morsels: who shall stand before the face of his cold?
<br>18	He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.
<br>19	Who declareth his word to Jacob: his jus- tices and his judgments to Israel.
<br>20	He hath not done in like manner to every nation: and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them. Alleluia.

<br>5	Praise the name of the Lord. For he spoke, and they were made: he commanded, and they were created.

<br>7	Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all ye deeps:
<br>8	Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which fulfil his word:
<br>9	Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars:
<br>10	Beasts and all cattle: serpents and feath- ered fowls:
<br>11	Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the earth:
<br>12	Young men and maidens: let the old with the younger, praise the name of the Lord:
<br>13	For his name alone is exalted.
<br>14	The praise of him is above heaven and earth: and he hath exalted the horn of his peo- ple. A hymn to all his saints to the children of Israel, a people approaching to him. Alleluia.

<br>3	Let them praise his name in choir: let them sing to him with the timbrel and the psaltery.
<br> 
<br>4	For the Lord is well pleased with his people: and he will exalt the meek unto salvation.
<br>5	The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds.
<br>6	The high praises of God shall be in their mouth: and two-edged swords in their hands:
<br>7	To execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the people:
<br>8	To bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron.
<br>9	To execute upon them the judgment that is written: this glory is to all his saints. Alleluia.

<br>5	Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: let every spirit praise the Lord. Alleluia.

<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,
<br>2	To know wisdom, and instruction:
<br>3	To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:
<br>4	To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding.
<br>5	A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth shall possess govern- ments.
<br>6	He shall understand a parable and the in- terpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.
<br>7	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wis- dom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
<br>8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
<br>9	That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.
<br>10	My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.
<br>11	If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:
<br>12	Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.
<br>13	We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.
<br> 
<br>
<br>14	Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.
<br>15	My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.
<br>16	For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
<br>17	But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.
<br>18	And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls.
<br>19	So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.
<br>20	Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:
<br>21	At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:
<br>22	O children, how long will you love childish- ness, and fools covet those things which are hurt- ful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowl- edge?
<br>23	Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.
<br>24	Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.
<br>25	You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.
<br>26	I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>27	When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:
<br>28	Then shall they call upon me,  and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning, and shall not find me:
<br>29	Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the Lord,
<br>30	Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.
<br>31	Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own de- vices.
<br>32	The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
<br>33	But he that shall hear me, shall rest with- out terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee,
<br>2	That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: in- cline thy heart to know prudence.
<br>3	For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence:
<br>4	If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure:
<br>5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God:
<br>6	Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge.
<br>7	He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity,
<br>8	Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.
<br> 
<br>9	Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path.
<br>10	If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul:
<br>11	Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,
<br>12	That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things:
<br>13	Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:
<br>14	Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most wicked things:
<br>15	Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.
<br>16	That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the stranger, who soft- eneth her words;
<br>17	And forsaketh the guide of her youth,
<br>18	And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.
<br>19	None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life.
<br>20	That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just.
<br>21	For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the simple shall continue in it.
<br>22	But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do unjustly, shall be taken away from it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.
<br>2	For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life, and peace.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Let not mercy aud truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the ta- bles of thy heart.
<br>4	And thou shalt find grace, and good under- standing before God and men.
<br>5	Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence.
<br>6	In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.
<br>7	Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil:
<br>8	For it shall be health to thy navel, and moist- ening to thy bones.
<br>9	Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits;
<br>10	And thy barns shall be filled with abun- dance, and thy presses shall run over with wine. 11 My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised
<br>by him:
<br>12	For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.
<br>13	Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence:
<br>14	The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chief and purest gold:
<br>15	She is more precious than all riches: and all the things that are desired, are not to be com- pared to her.
<br>16	Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory.
<br>17	Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable.
<br>18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and he that shall retain her is blessed.
<br>19	The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the heavens by prudence. 20 By his wisdom the depths have broken out,
<br>and the clouds grow thick with dew.
<br> 
<br>21	My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes: keep the law and counsel:
<br>22	And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth.
<br>23	Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble:
<br>24	If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<br>25	Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked falling upon thee.
<br>26	For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken.
<br>27	Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able: if thou art able, do good thyself also.
<br>28	Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again: and to morrow I will give to thee: when thou canst give at present.
<br>29	Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in thee.
<br>30	Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no evil.
<br>31	Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways.
<br>32	For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is with the simple. 33 Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked: but the habitations of the just shall be
<br>blessed.
<br>34	He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace.
<br>35	The wise shall possess glory: the promotion of fools is disgrace.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend, that you may know prudence.
<br>2 I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	For I also was my father’s son, tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother:
<br>4	And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live.
<br>5	Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, nei- ther decline from the words of my mouth.
<br>6	Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee.
<br>7	The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence.
<br>8	Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her.
<br>9	She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown.
<br>10	Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee.
<br>11	I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity:
<br>12	Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.
<br>13	Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life.
<br>14	Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee.
<br>15	Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it.
<br>16	For they sleep not, except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall.
<br>17	They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.
<br>18	But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards, and increaseth even to perfect day.
<br>19	The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall.
<br> 
<br>20	My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.
<br>21	Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart:
<br>22	For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh.
<br>23	With all watchfulness keep thy heart, be- cause life issueth out from it.
<br>24	Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee.
<br>25	Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps.
<br>26	Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established.
<br>27	Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence,
<br>2	That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.
<br>3	For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.
<br>4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.
<br>5	Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.
<br>6	They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable.
<br>7	Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.
<br>9	Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.
<br>10	Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man’s house,
<br>11	And thou mourn at the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say;
<br>12	Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,
<br>13	And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not inclined my ear to mas- ters?
<br>14	I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.
<br>15	Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:
<br>16	Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters.
<br>17	Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee.
<br>18	Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:
<br>19	Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times: be thou delighted continually with her love.
<br>20	Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another?
<br>21	The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.
<br>22	His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.
<br>23	He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger,
<br>2	Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.
<br>3	Do, therefore, my son, what I say, and de- liver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:
<br>4	Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.
<br>5	Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
<br>6	Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:
<br>7	Which, although she hath no guide, nor mas- ter, nor captain,
<br>8	Provideth her meat for herself in the sum- mer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
<br>9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
<br>10	Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep: 11 And want shall come upon thee, as a trav- eller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain,
<br>and want shall flee far from thee.
<br>12	A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,
<br>13	He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.
<br>14	With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.
<br>15	To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be de- stroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.
<br>16	Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
<br>18	A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,
<br>19	A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.
<br>20	My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
<br>21	Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.
<br>22	When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.
<br>23	Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
<br>24	That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.
<br>25	Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:
<br>26	For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.
<br>27	Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?
<br>28	Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?
<br>29	So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.
<br>30	The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:
<br>31	And if he be taken, he shall restore seven- fold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.
<br>32	But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:
<br>33	He gathereth to himself shame and dishon- our, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:
<br> 
<br>34	Because the jealousy and rage of the hus- band will not spare in the day of revenge,
<br>35	Nor will he yield to any man’s prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>
<br>My son, keep my words, and lay up my precepts with thee.  Son,
<br>2	Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thy eye:
<br>3	Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.
<br>4	Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,
<br>5	That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from the stranger who sweeteneth her words.
<br>6	For I looked out of the window of my house through the lattice,
<br>7	And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,
<br>8	Who passeth through the street by the cor- ner, and goeth nigh the way of her house,
<br>9	In the dark when it grows late, in the dark- ness and obscurity of the night.
<br>10	And behold a woman meeteth him in har- lot’s attire, prepared to deceive souls: talkative and wandering,
<br>11	Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,
<br>12	Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners.
<br>13	And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent face, flattereth, say- ing:
<br>14	I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	Therefore I am come out to meet thee, de- sirous to see thee, and I have found thee.
<br>16	I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.
<br>17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
<br>18	Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the desired embraces, till the day appear.
<br>19	For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.
<br>20	He took with him a bag of money: he will return home the day of the full moon.
<br>21	She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the flattery of her lips.
<br>22	Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to bonds,
<br>23	Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.
<br>24	Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and at- tend to the words of my mouth.
<br>25	Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths.
<br>26	For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been slain by her.
<br>27	Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers of death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>
<br>Doth not wisdom cry aloud, and prudence put forth her voice?
<br>2	Standing in the top of the highest places by the way, in the midst of the paths,
<br> 
<br>3	Beside the gates of the city, in the very doors she speaketh, saying:
<br>4	O ye men, to you I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.
<br>5	O little ones understand subtlety, and ye unwise, take notice.
<br>6	Hear, for I will speak of great things: and my lips shall be opened to preach right things.
<br>7	My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness.
<br>8	All my words are just, there is nothing wicked, nor perverse in them.
<br>9	They are right to them that understand, and just to them that find knowledge.
<br>10	Receive my instruction, and not money: choose knowledge rather than gold.
<br>11	For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to it.
<br>12	I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.
<br>13	The fear of the Lord hateth evil; I hate arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.
<br>14	Counsel and equity is mine, prudence is mine, strength is mine.
<br>16	By me princes rule, and the mighty decree justice.
<br>17	I love them that love me: and they that in the morning early watch for me, shall find me.
<br>18	With me are riches and glory, glorious riches and justice.
<br>19	For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my blossoms than choice sil- ver.
<br>20	I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,
<br>21	That I may enrich them that love me, and may fill their treasures.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.
<br>23	I was set up from eternity, and of old, be- fore the earth was made.
<br>24	The depths were not as yet, and I was al- ready conceived, neither had the fountains of wa- ters as yet sprung out.
<br>25	The mountains, with their huge bulk, had not as yet been established: before the hills, I was brought forth:
<br>26	He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.
<br>27	When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law, and compass, he enclosed the depths:
<br>28	When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:
<br>29	When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when he balanced the foundations of the earth;
<br>30	I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;
<br>31	Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.
<br>32	Now, therefore, ye children, hear me: blessed are they that keep my ways.
<br>33	Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
<br>34	Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.
<br>35	He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.
<br>36	But he that shall sin against me shall hurt his own soul. All that hate me love death.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>
<br>Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars.
<br>2	She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table.
<br>3	She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:
<br>4	Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:
<br>5	Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.
<br>6	Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.
<br>7	He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself; and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.
<br>8	Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee. Re- buke a wise man, and he will love thee.
<br>9	Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.
<br>10	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is pru- dence.
<br>11	For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.
<br>12	If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil.
<br>13	A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all,
<br>14	Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the city,
<br>15	To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:
<br>16	He that is a little one, let him turn to me.
<br>And to the fool she said:
<br>17	Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>A wise son maketh the father glad: but a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother.
<br>2	Treasures of wickedness shall profit nothing: but justice shall deliver from death.
<br>3	The Lord will not afflict the soul of the just with famine, and he will disappoint the deceitful practices of the wicked.
<br>4	The slothful hand hath wrought poverty: but the hand of the industrious getteth riches. He that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds: and the same runneth after birds, that fly away.
<br>5	He that gathereth in the harvest, is a wise son: but he that snorteth in the summer, is the son of confusion.
<br>6	The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but iniquity covereth the mouth of the wicked.
<br>7	The memory of the just is with praises: and the name of the wicked shall rot.
<br>8	The wise of heart receiveth precepts: a fool is beaten with lips.
<br>9	He that walketh sincerely, walketh confi- dently: but he that perverteth his ways, shall be manifest.
<br>10	He that winketh with the eye, shall cause sorrow: and the foolish in lips shall be beaten.
<br>11	The mouth of the just is a vein of life: and the mouth of the wicked covereth iniquity.
<br>12	Hatred stirreth up strifes: and charity cov- ereth all sins.
<br>13	In the lips of the wise is wisdom found: and a rod on the back of him that wanteth sense.
<br>14	Wise men lay up knowledge:	but the mouth of the fool is next to confusion.
<br> 
<br>15	The substance of a rich man is the city of his strength: the fear of the poor is their poverty. 16 The work of the just is unto life: but the
<br>fruit of the wicked unto sin.
<br>17	The way of life, to him that observeth cor- rection: but he that forsaketh reproofs, goeth astray.
<br>18	Lying lips hide hatred: he that uttereth reproach, is foolish.
<br>19	In the multitude of words there shall not want sin: but he that refraineth his lips, is most wise.
<br>20	The tongue of the just is as choice silver: but the heart of the wicked is nothing worth.
<br>21	The lips of the just teach many: but they that are ignorant, shall die in the want of under- standing.
<br>22	The blessing of the Lord maketh men rich: neither shall affliction be joined to them.
<br>23	A fool worketh mischief as it were for sport: but wisdom is prudence to a man.
<br>24	That which the wicked feareth, shall come upon him: to the just their desire shall be given. 25 As a tempest that passeth, so the wicked shall be no more: but the just is as an everlasting
<br>foundation.
<br>26	As vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that sent him.
<br>27	The fear of the Lord shall prolong days: and the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
<br>28	The expectation of the just is joy: but the hope of the wicked shall perish.
<br>29	The strength of the upright is the way of the Lord: and fear to them that work evil.
<br>30	The just shall never be moved: but the wicked shall not dwell on the earth.
<br>31	The mouth of the just shall bring forth wisdom: the tongue of the perverse shall perish. 32 The lips of the just consider what is ac- ceptable: and the mouth of the wicked uttereth
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>perverse things.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>A deceitful balance is an abomination before the Lord: and a just weight is his will.
<br>2	Where pride is, there also shall be reproach: but where humility is, there also is wisdom.
<br>3	The simplicity of the just shall guide them: and the deceitfulness of the wicked shall destroy them.
<br>4	Riches shall not profit in the day of revenge: but justice shall deliver from death.
<br>5	The justice of the upright shall make his way prosperous: and the wicked man shall fall by his own wickedness.
<br>6	The justice of the righteous shall deliver them: and the unjust shall be caught in their own snares.
<br>7	When the wicked man is dead, there shall be no hope any more: and the expectation of the solicitous shall perish.
<br>8	The just is delivered out of distress: and the wicked shall be given up for him.
<br>9	The dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend: but the just shall be delivered by knowl- edge.
<br>10	When it goeth well with the just, the city shall rejoice: and when the wicked perish, there shall be praise.
<br>11	By the blessing of the just the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the wicked it shall be overthrown.
<br>12	He that despiseth his friend, is mean of heart: but the wise man will hold his peace.
<br>13	He that walketh deceitfully, revealeth se- crets: but he that is faithful, concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend.
<br> 
<br>14	Where there is no governor, the people shall fall: but there is safety where there is much counsel.
<br>15	He shall be afflicted with evil, that is surety for a stranger: but he that is aware of snares, shall be secure.
<br>16	A gracious woman shall find glory: and the strong shall have riches.
<br>17	A merciful man doth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel casteth off even his own kin- dred.
<br>18	The wicked maketh an unsteady work: but to him that soweth justice, there is a faithful reward.
<br>19	Clemency prepareth life: and the pursuing of evil things, death.
<br>20	A perverse heart is abominable to the Lord: and his will is in them that walk sincerely.
<br>21	Hand in hand the evil man shall not be innocent: but the seed of the just shall be saved. 22 A golden ring in a swine’s snout, a woman
<br>fair and foolish.
<br>23	The desire of the just is all good, the ex- pectation of the wicked is indignation.
<br>24	Some distribute their own goods, and grow richer: others take away what is not their own, and are always in want.
<br>25	The soul that blesseth, shall be made fat: and he that inebriateth, shall be inebriated also himself.
<br>26	He that hideth up corn, shall be cursed among the people: but a blessing upon the head of them that sell.
<br>27	Well doth he rise early who seeketh good things; but he that seeketh after evil things, shall be oppressed by them.
<br>28	He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the just shall spring up as a green leaf.
<br>29	He that troubleth his own house, shall in- herit the winds: and the fool shall serve the wise.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	The fruit of the just man is a tree of life: and he that gaineth souls is wise.
<br>31	If the just man receive in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>
<br>He that loveth correction, loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof, is foolish.
<br>2	He that is good, shall draw grace from the Lord: but he that trusteth in his own devices, doth wickedly.
<br>3	Man shall not be strengthened by wicked- ness: and the root of the just shall not be moved. 4 A diligent woman is a crown to her husband: and she that doth things worthy of confusion, is
<br>as rottenness in his bones.
<br>5	The thoughts of the just are judgments: and the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.
<br>6	The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood: the mouth of the just shall deliver them.
<br>7	Turn the wicked, and they shall not be: but the house of the just shall stand firm.
<br>8	A man shall be known by his learning: but he that is vain and foolish, shall be exposed to contempt.
<br>9	Better is the poor man that provideth for himself, than he that is glorious and wanteth bread.
<br>10	The just regardeth the lives of his beasts: but the bowels of the wicked are cruel.
<br>11	He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that pursueth idleness is very foolish.
<br>12	He that is delighted in passing his time over wine, leaveth a reproach in his strong holds.
<br>12	The desire of the wicked is the fortification of evil men: but the root of the just shall prosper.
<br> 
<br>13	For the sins of the lips ruin draweth nigh to the evil man: but the just shall escape out of distress.
<br>14	By the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled wlth good things, and according to the works of his hands it shall be repaid him.
<br>15	The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsels.
<br>16	A fool immediately sheweth his anger: but he that dissembleth injuries is wise.
<br>17	He that speaketh that which he knoweth, sheweth forth justice: but he that lieth, is a de- ceitful witness.
<br>18	There is that promiseth, and is pricked as it were with a sword of conscience: but the tongue of the wise is health.
<br>19	The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever: but he that is a hasty witness, frameth a lying tongue.
<br>20	Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil things: but joy followeth them that take counsels of peace.
<br>21	Whatsoever shall befall the just man, shall not make him sad: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.
<br>22	Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: but they that deal faithfully, please him.
<br>23	A cautious man concealeth knowledge: and the heart of fools publisheth folly.
<br>24	The hand of the valiant shall bear rule: but that which is slothful shall be under tribute.
<br>25	Grief in the heart of a man shall bring him low, but with a good word he shall be made glad. 26 He that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend, is just: but the way of the wicked shall
<br>deceive them.
<br>27 The deceitful man shall not find gain: but the substance of a just man shall be precious gold.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>28 In the path of justice is life: but the bye- way leadeth to death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>A wise son heareth the doctrine of his father: but he that is a scorner, heareth not when he is reproved.
<br>2	Of the fruit of his own month shall a man be filled with good things: but the soul of trans- gressors is wicked.
<br>3	He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his soul: but he that hath no guard on his speech shall meet with evils.
<br>4	The sluggard willeth, and willeth not: but the soul of them that work, shall be made fat.
<br>5	The just shall hate a lying word: but the wicked confoundeth, and shall be confounded.
<br>6	Justice keepeth the way of the innocent: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
<br>7	One is as it were rich, when he hath nothing and another is as it were poor, when he hath great riches.
<br>8	The ransom of a man’s life are his riches: but he that is poor, beareth not reprehension.
<br>9	The light of the just giveth joy: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
<br>10	Among the proud there are always con- tentions: but they that do all things with coun- sel, are ruled by wisdom.
<br>11	Substance got in haste shall be diminished: but that which by little and little is gathered with the hand, shall increase.
<br>12	Hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul: desire when it cometh, is a tree of life.
<br>13	Whosoever speaketh ill of any thing, bindeth himself for the time to come: but he that feareth the commandment, shall dwell in
<br> 
<br>peace. Deceitful souls go astray in sins: the just are merciful, and shew mercy.
<br>14	The law of the wise is a fountain of life, that he may decline from the ruin of death.
<br>15	Good instruction shall give grace: in the way of scorners is a deep pit.
<br>16	The prudent man doth all things with counsel: but he that is a fool, layeth open his folly.
<br>17	The messenger of the wicked shall fall into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.
<br>18	Poverty and shame to him that refuseth instruction: but he that yieldeth to reproof shall be glorified.
<br>19	The desire that is accomplished, delighteth the soul: fools hate them that flee from evil things.
<br>20	He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise: a friend of fools shall become like to them. 21 Evil pursueth sinners: and to the just good
<br>shall be repaid.
<br>22	The good man leaveth heirs, sons, and grandsons: and the substance of the sinner is kept for the just.
<br>23	Much food is in the tillage of fathers: but for others it is gathered without judgment.
<br>24	He that  spareth the  rod, hateth  his son: but he that loveth him, correcteth him betimes. 25 The just eateth and filleth his soul: but the
<br>belly of the wicked is never to be filled.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>A wise woman buildeth her house: but the fool- ish will pull down with her hands that also which is built.
<br>2	He that walketh in the right way, and feareth God, is despised by him that goeth by an infa- mous way.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	In the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wise preserve them.
<br>4	Where there are no oxen, the crib is empty: but where there is much corn, there the strength of the ox is manifest.
<br>5	A faithful witness will not lie: but a deceitful witness uttereth a lie.
<br>6	A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: the learning of the wise is easy.
<br>7	Go against a foolish man, and he knoweth not the lips of prudence.
<br>8	The wisdom of a discreet man is to under- stand his way: and the imprudence of fools er- reth.
<br>9	A fool will laugh at sin, but among the just grace shall abide.
<br>10	The heart that knoweth the bitterness of his own soul, in his joy the stranger shall not intermeddle.
<br>11	The house of the wicked shall be destroyed: but the tabernacles of the just shall flourish.
<br>12	There is a way which seemeth just to a man: but the ends thereof lead to death.
<br>13	Laughter shall be mingled with sorrow, and mourning taketh hold of the ends of joy.
<br>14	A fool shall be filled with his own ways, and the good man shall be above him.
<br>15	The innocent believeth every word: the dis- creet man considereth his steps. No good shall come to the deceitfnl son: but the wise servant shall prosper in his dealings, and his way shall be made straight.
<br>16	A wise man feareth, and declineth from evil: the fool leapeth over, and is confident.
<br>17	The impatient man shall work folly: and the crafty man is hateful.
<br>18	The childish shall possess folly, and the prudent shall look for knowledge.
<br>19	The evil shall fall down before the good: and the wicked before the gates of the just.
<br> 
<br>20	The poor man shall be hateful even to his own neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.
<br>21	He that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth: but he that sheweth mercy to the poor, shall be blessed. He that believeth in the Lord, loveth mercy.
<br>22	They err that work evil: but mercy and truth prepare good things.
<br>23	In much work there shall be abundance: but where there are many words, there is often- times want.
<br>24	The crown of the wise, is their riches: the folly of fools, imprudence.
<br>25	A faithful witness delivereth souls: and the double dealer uttereth lies.
<br>26	In the fear of the Lord is confidence of strength, and there shall be hope for his chil- dren.
<br>27	The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to decline from the ruin of death.
<br>28	In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king: and in the small number of the people the dishonour of the prince.
<br>29	He that is patient, is governed with much wisdom: but he that is impatient, exalteth his folly.
<br>30	Soundness of heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones.
<br>31	He that oppresseth the poor, upbraideth his maker: but he that hath pity on the poor, honoureth him.
<br>32	The wicked man shall be driven out in his wickedness: but the just hath hope in his death. 33 In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom,
<br>and it shall instruct all the ignorant.
<br>34	Justice exalteth a nation: but sin maketh nations miserable.
<br>35	A wise servant is acceptable to the king: he that is good for nothing shall feel his anger.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 15
<br>
<br>A mild answer breaketh wrath: but a harsh word stirreth up fury.
<br>2	The tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge: but the mouth of fools bubbleth out folly.
<br>3	The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the good and the evil.
<br>4	A peaceable tongue is a tree of life: but that which is immoderate, shall crush the spirit.
<br>5	A fool laugheth at the instruction of his fa- ther: but he that regardeth reproofs shall be- come prudent. In abundant justice there is the greatest strength: but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted out.
<br>6	The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the wicked is trouble.
<br>7	The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike.
<br>8	The victims of the wicked are abominable to the Lord: the vows of the just are acceptable.
<br>9	The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: he that followeth justice is beloved by him.
<br>10	Instruction is grievous to him that for- saketh the way of life: he that hateth reproof shall die.
<br>11	Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?
<br>12	A corrupt man loveth not one that re- proveth him: nor will he go to the wise.
<br>13	A glad heart maketh a cheerful counte- nance: but by grief of mind the spirit is cast down.
<br>14	The heart of the wise seeketh instruction: and the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
<br>15	All the days of the poor are evil: a secure mind is like a continual feast.
<br> 
<br>16	Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasures without content.
<br>17	It is better to be invited to herbs with love, than to a fatted calf with hatred.
<br>18	A passionate man stirreth up strifes: he that is patient appeaseth those that are stirred up.
<br>19	The way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns: the way of the just is without offence.
<br>20	A wise son maketh a father joyful: but the foolish man despiseth his mother.
<br>21	Folly is joy to the fool: and the wise man maketh straight his steps.
<br>22	Designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel: but where there are many coun- sellors, they are established.
<br>23	A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth: and a word in due time is best.
<br>24	The path of life is above for the wise, that he may decline from the lowest hell.
<br>25	The Lord will destroy the house of the proud: and will strengthen the borders of the widow.
<br>26	Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord: and pure words most beautiful shall be confirmed by him.
<br>27	He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house: but he that hateth bribes shall live. By mercy and faith sins are purged away: and by the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil.
<br>28	The mind of the just studieth obedience: the mouth of the wicked overfloweth with evils. 29 The Lord is far from the wicked: and he
<br>will hear the prayers of the just.
<br>30	The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name maketh the bones fat.
<br>31	The ear that heareth the reproofs of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>32	He that rejecteth instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof, pos- sesseth understanding.
<br>33	The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wis- dom: and humility goeth before glory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>
<br>It is the part of man to prepare the soul: and of the Lord to govern the tongue.
<br>2	All the ways of a man are open to his eyes: the Lord is the weigher of spirits.
<br>3	Lay open thy works to the Lord: and thy thoughts shall be directed.
<br>4	The Lord hath made all things for himself: the wicked also for the evil day.
<br>5	Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice: and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.
<br>6	By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed; and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.
<br>7	When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.
<br>8	Better is a little with justice, than great rev- enues with iniquity.
<br>9	The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.
<br>10	Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.
<br>11	Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.
<br>12	They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice. 13 Just lips are the delight of kings: he that
<br>speaketh right things shall be loved.
<br> 
<br>14	The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: and the wise man will pacify it.
<br>15	In the cheerfulness of the king’s counte- nance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.
<br>16	Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.
<br>17	The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.
<br>18	Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.
<br>19	It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.
<br>20	The learned in word shall find good things: and he that trusteth in the Lord is blessed.
<br>21	The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and he that is sweet in words, shall attain to greater things.
<br>22	Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it: the instruction of fools is foolish- ness.
<br>23	The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth: and shall add grace to his lips.
<br>24	Well ordered words are as a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
<br>25	There is a way that seemeth to a man right: and the ends thereof lead to death.
<br>26	The soul of him that laboureth, laboureth for himself, because his mouth hath obliged him to it.
<br>27	The wicked man diggeth evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.
<br>28	A perverse man stirreth up quarrels: and one full of words separateth princes.
<br>29	An unjust man allureth his friend: and leadeth him into a way that is not good.
<br>30	He that with fixed eyes deviseth wicked things, biting his lips, bringeth evil to pass.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>31	Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.
<br>32	The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh cities.
<br>33	Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>
<br>Better is a dry morsel with joy, than a house full of victims with strife.
<br>2	A wise servant shall rule over foolish sons, and shall divide the inheritance among the brethren.
<br>3	As silver is tried by fire, and gold in the furnace: so the Lord trieth the hearts.
<br>4	The evil man obeyeth an unjust tongue: and the deceitful hearkeneth to lying lips.
<br>5	He that despiseth the poor, reproacheth his maker: and he that rejoiceth at another man’s ruin, shall not be unpunished.
<br>6	Children’s children are the crown of old men: and the glory of children are their fathers.
<br>7	Eloquent words do not become a fool, nor lying lips a prince.
<br>8	The expectation of him that expecteth is a most acceptable jewel: whithersoever he turneth himself, he understandeth wisely.
<br>9	He that concealeth a transgression, seeketh friendships: he that repeateth it again, sepa- rateth friends.
<br>10	A reproof availeth more with a wise man, than a hundred stripes with a fool.
<br>11	An evil man always seeketh quarrels: but a cruel angel shall be sent against him.
<br>12	It is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool trusting in his own folly.
<br> 
<br>13	He that rendereth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
<br>14	The beginning of quarrels is as when one letteth out water: and before he suffereth re- proach, he forsaketh judgment.
<br>15	He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, both are abominable be- fore God.
<br>16	What doth it avail a fool to have riches, seeing he cannot buy wisdom? He that maketh his house high, seeketh a downfall: and he that refuseth to learn, shall fall into evils.
<br>17	He that is a friend loveth at all times: and a brother is proved in distress.
<br>18	A foolish man will clap hands, when he is surety for his friend.
<br>19	He that studieth discords, loveth quarrels: and he that exalteth his door, seeketh ruin.
<br>20	He that is of a perverse heart, shall not find good: and he that perverteth his tongue, shall fall into evil.
<br>21	A fool is born to his own disgrace: and even his father shall not rejoice in a fool.
<br>22	A joyful mind maketh age flourishing: a sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones.
<br>23	The wicked man taketh gifts out of the bo- som, that he may pervert the paths of judgment. 24 Wisdom shineth in the face of the wise: the
<br>eyes of fools are in the ends of the earth.
<br>25	A foolish son is the anger of the father: and the sorrow of the mother that bore him.
<br>26	It is no good thing to do hurt to the just: nor to strike the prince, who judgeth right.
<br>27	He that setteth bounds to his words, is knowing and wise: and the man of understand- ing is of a precious spirit.
<br>28	Even a fool, if he will hold his peace, shall be counted wise: and if he close his lips, a man of understanding.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 18
<br>
<br>He that hath a mind to depart from a friend, seeketh occasions: he shall ever be subject to reproach.
<br>2	A fool receiveth not the words of prudence: unless thou say those things which are in his heart.
<br>3	The wicked man, when he is come into the depths of sins, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him.
<br>4	Words from the mouth of a man are as deep water: and the fountain of wisdom is an over- flowing stream.
<br>5	It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to decline from the truth of judgment.
<br>6	The lips of a fool intermeddle with strife: and his mouth provoketh quarrels.
<br>7	The mouth of a fool is his destruction: and his lips are the ruin of his soul.
<br>8	The words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless: and they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels. Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry.
<br>9	He that is loose and slack in his work, is the brother of him that wasteth his own works.
<br>10	The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the just runneth to it, and shall be exalted.
<br>11	The substance of the rich man is the city of his strength, and as a strong wall compassing him about.
<br>12	Before destruction, the heart of a man is exalted: and before he be glorified, it is humbled.
<br>13	He that answereth before he heareth, sheweth himself to be a fool, and worthy of con- fusion.
<br>14	The spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity: but a spirit that is easily angered, who can bear?
<br> 
<br>15	A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction.
<br>16	A man’s gift enlargeth his way, and maketh him room before princes.
<br>17	The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him.
<br>18	The lot suppresseth contentions, and de- termineth even between the mighty.
<br>19	A brother that is helped by his brother, is like a strong city: and judgments are like the bars of cities.
<br>20	Of the fruit of a man’s mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and the offspring of his lips shall fill him.
<br>21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue: they that love it, shall eat the fruits thereof.
<br>22	He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and shall receive a pleasure from the Lord. He that driveth away a good wife, driveth away a good thing: but he that keepeth an adulteress, is foolish and wicked.
<br>23	The poor will speak with supplications, and the rich will speak roughly.
<br>24	A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Better is the poor man, that walketh in his sim- plicity, than a rich man that is perverse in his lips and unwise.
<br>2	Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble.
<br>3	The folly of a man supplanteth his steps: and he fretteth in his mind against God.
<br>4	Riches make many friends: but from the poor man, even they whom he had, depart.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall not escape.
<br>6	Many honour the person of him that is mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts.
<br>7	The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him. He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing.
