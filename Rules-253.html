<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>The Secretary may establish and operate a permanent Joint Interagency Homeland Security Task Force composed of representatives from military and civilian agencies of the United States Government for the purposes of anticipating terrorist threats against the United States and taking appropriate actions to prevent harm to the United States.
<br>(b) Structure
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary should model the Joint Interagency Homeland Security Task Force on the approach taken by the Joint Interagency Task Forces for drug interdiction at Key West, Florida and Alameda, California, to the maximum extent feasible and appropriate.

<br>§466. Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the "Posse Comitatus Act") prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.
<br>
<br>(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal law.
<br>
<br>(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.
<br>
<br>(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.
<br>
<br>(5) Existing laws, including chapter 13 of title 10 (commonly known as the "Insurrection Act"), and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 114–22, title III, §302(a), May 29, 2015, 129 Stat. 251, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The illegal market for the production and distribution of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the United States. International demand for this material creates a powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children within the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) The targeting of United States children by international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland security of the United States. This threat must be fought with trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-exploitation strategies and technologies.
<br>
<br>"(3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical national security role in protecting the United States from the growing international threat of child exploitation and human trafficking.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national resource in the effort to combat international child exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.
<br>
<br>"(5) The returning military heroes of the United States possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, and the Department of Homeland Security should use this national resource to the maximum extent possible.
<br>
<br>"(6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue children from sexual abuse and slavery."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "Program".
<br>
<br>2 So in original. "Program" probably should be inserted at end of heading.
<br>
<br>3 So in original. Probably should be "Operative".
<br>Part I—Information Sharing
<br>§481. Short title; findings; and sense of Congress
<br>(a) Short title
<br>
<br>This part may be cited as the "Homeland Security Information Sharing Act".
<br>(b) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.
<br>
<br>(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.
<br>
<br>(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security.
<br>
<br>(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.
<br>
<br>(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.
<br>
<br>(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of government.
<br>
<br>(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.
<br>
<br>(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.
<br>
<br>(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such information.
<br>
<br>(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.
<br>
<br>(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.
<br>
<br>(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing information systems.
<br>(c) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.

<br>
<br>(A) share relevant and appropriate homeland security information with other Federal agencies, including the Department, and appropriate State and local personnel;
<br>
<br>(B) identify and safeguard homeland security information that is sensitive but unclassified; and

<br>(C) to the extent such information is in classified form, determine whether, how, and to what extent to remove classified information, as appropriate, and with which such personnel it may be shared after such information is removed.
<br>
<br>(2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply to all agencies of the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive requirements for the classification and safeguarding of classified information.

<br>(1) Under procedures prescribed by the President, all appropriate agencies, including the intelligence community, shall, through information sharing systems, share homeland security information with Federal agencies and appropriate State and local personnel to the extent such information may be shared, as determined in accordance with subsection (a), together with assessments of the credibility of such information.
<br>
<br>(2) Each information sharing system through which information is shared under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or classified information, though the procedures and recipients for each capability may differ;
<br>
<br>(B) have the capability to restrict delivery of information to specified subgroups by geographic location, type of organization, position of a recipient within an organization, or a recipient's need to know such information;
<br>
<br>(C) be configured to allow the efficient and effective sharing of information; and
<br>
<br>(D) be accessible to appropriate State and local personnel.
<br>
<br>(3) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall establish conditions on the use of information shared under paragraph (1)—

<br>
<br>(5) Each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the President, shall have access to each information sharing system through which information is shared under paragraph (1), and shall therefore have access to all information, as appropriate, shared under such paragraph.
<br>
<br>(6) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure that appropriate State and local personnel are authorized to use such information sharing systems—
<br>
<br>(A) to access information shared with such personnel; and
<br>
<br>(B) to share, with others who have access to such information sharing systems, the homeland security information of their own jurisdictions, which shall be marked appropriately as pertaining to potential terrorist activity.
<br>
<br>(7) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the Attorney General, each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the President, shall review and assess the information shared under paragraph (6) and integrate such information with existing intelligence.
<br>(c) Sharing of classified information and sensitive but unclassified information with State and local personnel
<br>

<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish a program to provide appropriate training to officials described in subparagraph (B) in order to assist such officials in—
<br>
<br>(i) identifying sources of potential terrorist threats through such methods as the Secretary determines appropriate;
<br>
<br>(ii) reporting information relating to such potential terrorist threats to the appropriate Federal agencies in the appropriate form and manner;
<br>
<br>(iii) assuring that all reported information is systematically submitted to and passed on by the Department for use by appropriate Federal agencies; and
<br>
<br>(iv) understanding the mission and roles of the intelligence community to promote more effective information sharing among Federal, State, and local officials and representatives of the private sector to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) The officials referred to in subparagraph (A) are officials of State and local government agencies and representatives of private sector entities with responsibilities relating to the oversight and management of first responders, counterterrorism activities, or critical infrastructure.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall consult with the Attorney General to ensure that the training program established in subparagraph (A) does not duplicate the training program established in section 908 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107–56; 28 U.S.C. 509 note).
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence and the Attorney General.

<br>
<br>For each affected Federal agency, the head of such agency shall designate an official to administer this chapter with respect to such agency.
