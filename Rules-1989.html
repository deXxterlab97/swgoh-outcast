<br>
<br>(aa) analytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
<br>
<br>(bb) animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
<br>
<br>(cc) a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in 1 or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product;
<br>
<br>(II) the biological product and reference product utilize the same mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism or mechanisms of action are known for the reference product;
<br>
<br>(III) the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the biological product have been previously approved for the reference product;
<br>
<br>(IV) the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the biological product are the same as those of the reference product; and

<br>
<br>An application (or a supplement to an application) submitted under this subsection may include information demonstrating that the biological product meets the standards described in paragraph (4).
<br>(3) Evaluation by Secretary
<br>
<br>Upon review of an application (or a supplement to an application) submitted under this subsection, the Secretary shall license the biological product under this subsection if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or the supplement) is sufficient to show that the biological product—
<br>
<br>(i) is biosimilar to the reference product; or
<br>
<br>(ii) meets the standards described in paragraph (4), and therefore is interchangeable with the reference product; and
<br>
<br>(B) the applicant (or other appropriate person) consents to the inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application, in accordance with subsection (c).
<br>(4) Safety standards for determining interchangeability
<br>
<br>Upon review of an application submitted under this subsection or any supplement to such application, the Secretary shall determine the biological product to be interchangeable with the reference product if the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or a supplement to such application) is sufficient to show that—
<br>
<br>(A) the biological product—
<br>
<br>(i) is biosimilar to the reference product; and
<br>
<br>(ii) can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
<br>
<br>(B) for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
<br>(5) General rules
<br>(A) One reference product per application
<br>
<br>A biological product, in an application submitted under this subsection, may not be evaluated against more than 1 reference product.

<br>
<br>(ii) the dismissal with or without prejudice of an action instituted under subsection (l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar biological product; or
<br>
<br>(C)(i) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product if the applicant that submitted such application has been sued under subsection (l)(6) and such litigation is still ongoing within such 42-month period; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product if the applicant that submitted such application has not been sued under subsection (l)(6).
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "final court decision" means a final decision of a court from which no appeal (other than a petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari) has been or can be taken.
<br>(7) Exclusivity for reference product
<br>(A) Effective date of biosimilar application approval
<br>
<br>Approval of an application under this subsection may not be made effective by the Secretary until the date that is 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under subsection (a).

<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed—
<br>
<br>(i) as an admission by the subsection (k) applicant regarding the validity, enforceability, or infringement of any patent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) as an agreement or admission by the subsection (k) applicant with respect to the competency, relevance, or materiality of any confidential information.
<br>(H) Effect of violation
<br>
<br>The disclosure of any confidential information in violation of this paragraph shall be deemed to cause the subsection (k) applicant to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate legal remedy and the court shall consider immediate injunctive relief to be an appropriate and necessary remedy for any violation or threatened violation of this paragraph.
<br>(2) Subsection (k) application information
<br>
