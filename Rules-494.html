<br>
<br>1 So in original. Does not conform to section catchline.
<br>§701. Cooperation with other agencies, States, territories, and political subdivisions
<br>
<br>(a) The Coast Guard may, when so requested by proper authority, utilize its personnel and facilities (including members of the Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 39) to assist any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, to perform any activity for which such personnel and facilities are especially qualified. The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(b) The Coast Guard, with the consent of the head of the agency concerned, may avail itself of such officers and employees, advice, information, and facilities of any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia as may be helpful in the performance of its duties. In connection with the utilization of personal services of employees of state or local governments, the Coast Guard may make payments for necessary traveling and per diem expenses as prescribed for Federal employees by the standardized Government travel regulations.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 505, §141; Pub. L. 104–324, title IV, §405(a), Oct. 19, 1996, 110 Stat. 3924; renumbered §701 and amended Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §§106(b), 123(c)(6), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4203, 4241.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This section is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §756 (Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81, §6, 38 Stat. 928), and authorizes the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other Government agencies when requested and, correlatively, authorizes the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other agencies. It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled out by statute because in times of emergency, for example floods, it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2018—Pub. L. 115–282, §106(b), renumbered section 141 of this title as this section.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 115–282, §123(c)(6), substituted "chapter 39" for "chapter 23".
<br>
<br>1996—Pub. L. 104–324, §405(a)(1), amended section catchline generally, substituting "Cooperation with other agencies, States, territories, and political subdivisions" for "General".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104–324, §405(a)(2), (3), inserted "(including members of the Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 23)" after "personnel and facilities" and "The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided under this subsection." at end.
<br>§702. State Department
<br>
<br>The Coast Guard, through the Secretary, may exchange information, through the Secretary of State, with foreign governments and suggest to the Secretary of State international collaboration and conferences on all matters dealing with the safety of life and property at sea, other than radio communication.
<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 505, §142; renumbered §702, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §106(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4203.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.
<br>
<br>The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.
<br>
<br>Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements. Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>
<br>Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441a (May 19, 1926, ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109, 49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571, 56 Stat. 763; 1946 Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, 60 Stat. 1352).
<br>
<br>Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.
<br>
<br>It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441–a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>§711. Coast Guard officers as attachés to missions
<br>
<br>Commissioned officers may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, be regularly and officially attached to the diplomatic missions of the United States in those nations with which the United States is extensively engaged in maritime commerce.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime commerce with the United States. This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.
<br>
<br>This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad were agricultural attachés. Act of June 5, 1930, 46 Stat. 498 (title 7, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §542(a)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
