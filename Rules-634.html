<br>SUBCHAPTER I—ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES IN COMMERCE
<br>§7001. General rule of validity
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any statute, regulation, or other rule of law (other than this subchapter and subchapter II), with respect to any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce—
<br>
<br>(1) a signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and
<br>
<br>(2) a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation.
<br>(b) Preservation of rights and obligations
<br>
<br>This subchapter does not—
<br>
<br>(1) limit, alter, or otherwise affect any requirement imposed by a statute, regulation, or rule of law relating to the rights and obligations of persons under such statute, regulation, or rule of law other than a requirement that contracts or other records be written, signed, or in nonelectronic form; or
<br>
<br>(2) require any person to agree to use or accept electronic records or electronic signatures, other than a governmental agency with respect to a record other than a contract to which it is a party.
<br>(c) Consumer disclosures
<br>(1) Consent to electronic records
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires that information relating to a transaction or transactions in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce be provided or made available to a consumer in writing, the use of an electronic record to provide or make available (whichever is required) such information satisfies the requirement that such information be in writing if—
<br>
<br>(A) the consumer has affirmatively consented to such use and has not withdrawn such consent;
<br>
<br>(B) the consumer, prior to consenting, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement—
<br>
<br>(i) informing the consumer of (I) any right or option of the consumer to have the record provided or made available on paper or in nonelectronic form, and (II) the right of the consumer to withdraw the consent to have the record provided or made available in an electronic form and of any conditions, consequences (which may include termination of the parties' relationship), or fees in the event of such withdrawal;
<br>
<br>(ii) informing the consumer of whether the consent applies (I) only to the particular transaction which gave rise to the obligation to provide the record, or (II) to identified categories of records that may be provided or made available during the course of the parties' relationship;
<br>
<br>(iii) describing the procedures the consumer must use to withdraw consent as provided in clause (i) and to update information needed to contact the consumer electronically; and
<br>
<br>(iv) informing the consumer (I) how, after the consent, the consumer may, upon request, obtain a paper copy of an electronic record, and (II) whether any fee will be charged for such copy;
<br>
<br>(C) the consumer—
<br>
<br>(i) prior to consenting, is provided with a statement of the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of the electronic records; and
<br>
<br>(ii) consents electronically, or confirms his or her consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can access information in the electronic form that will be used to provide the information that is the subject of the consent; and
<br>
<br>(D) after the consent of a consumer in accordance with subparagraph (A), if a change in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain electronic records creates a material risk that the consumer will not be able to access or retain a subsequent electronic record that was the subject of the consent, the person providing the electronic record—
<br>
<br>(i) provides the consumer with a statement of (I) the revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of the electronic records, and (II) the right to withdraw consent without the imposition of any fees for such withdrawal and without the imposition of any condition or consequence that was not disclosed under subparagraph (B)(i); and
<br>
<br>(ii) again complies with subparagraph (C).
<br>(2) Other rights
<br>(A) Preservation of consumer protections
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subchapter affects the content or timing of any disclosure or other record required to be provided or made available to any consumer under any statute, regulation, or other rule of law.
<br>(B) Verification or acknowledgment
<br>
<br>If a law that was enacted prior to this chapter expressly requires a record to be provided or made available by a specified method that requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt, the record may be provided or made available electronically only if the method used provides verification or acknowledgment of receipt (whichever is required).
<br>(3) Effect of failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent
<br>
<br>The legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).
<br>(4) Prospective effect
<br>
<br>Withdrawal of consent by a consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided or made available to that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's withdrawal of consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent shall be effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the withdrawal by the provider of the record. Failure to comply with paragraph (1)(D) may, at the election of the consumer, be treated as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this paragraph.
<br>(5) Prior consent
<br>
<br>This subsection does not apply to any records that are provided or made available to a consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of this subchapter to receive such records in electronic form as permitted by any statute, regulation, or other rule of law.
<br>(6) Oral communications
<br>
<br>An oral communication or a recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an electronic record for purposes of this subsection except as otherwise provided under applicable law.
<br>(d) Retention of contracts and records
<br>(1) Accuracy and accessibility
<br>
<br>If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires that a contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce be retained, that requirement is met by retaining an electronic record of the information in the contract or other record that—
<br>
<br>(A) accurately reflects the information set forth in the contract or other record; and
<br>
<br>(B) remains accessible to all persons who are entitled to access by statute, regulation, or rule of law, for the period required by such statute, regulation, or rule of law, in a form that is capable of being accurately reproduced for later reference, whether by transmission, printing, or otherwise.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>A requirement to retain a contract or other record in accordance with paragraph (1) does not apply to any information whose sole purpose is to enable the contract or other record to be sent, communicated, or received.
<br>(3) Originals
<br>
<br>If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires a contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce to be provided, available, or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the contract or other record is not provided, available, or retained in its original form, that statute, regulation, or rule of law is satisfied by an electronic record that complies with paragraph (1).
<br>(4) Checks
<br>
<br>If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires the retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with paragraph (1).
<br>(e) Accuracy and ability to retain contracts and other records
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires that a contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce be in writing, the legal effect, validity, or enforceability of an electronic record of such contract or other record may be denied if such electronic record is not in a form that is capable of being retained and accurately reproduced for later reference by all parties or persons who are entitled to retain the contract or other record.
<br>(f) Proximity
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subchapter affects the proximity required by any statute, regulation, or other rule of law with respect to any warning, notice, disclosure, or other record required to be posted, displayed, or publicly affixed.
<br>(g) Notarization and acknowledgment
<br>
<br>If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires a signature or record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, that requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable statute, regulation, or rule of law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.
<br>(h) Electronic agents
<br>
<br>A contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because its formation, creation, or delivery involved the action of one or more electronic agents so long as the action of any such electronic agent is legally attributable to the person to be bound.
<br>(i) Insurance
<br>
<br>It is the specific intent of the Congress that this subchapter and subchapter II apply to the business of insurance.
<br>(j) Insurance agents and brokers
<br>
<br>An insurance agent or broker acting under the direction of a party that enters into a contract by means of an electronic record or electronic signature may not be held liable for any deficiency in the electronic procedures agreed to by the parties under that contract if—
<br>
<br>(1) the agent or broker has not engaged in negligent, reckless, or intentional tortious conduct;
<br>
<br>(2) the agent or broker was not involved in the development or establishment of such electronic procedures; and
<br>
<br>(3) the agent or broker did not deviate from such procedures.

<br>§7004. Applicability to Federal and State governments
<br>(a) Filing and access requirements
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (c)(2), nothing in this subchapter limits or supersedes any requirement by a Federal regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization, or State regulatory agency that records be filed with such agency or organization in accordance with specified standards or formats.
<br>(b) Preservation of existing rulemaking authority
<br>(1) Use of authority to interpret
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (c), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency that is responsible for rulemaking under any other statute may interpret section 7001 of this title with respect to such statute through—
<br>
<br>(A) the issuance of regulations pursuant to a statute; or
<br>
<br>(B) to the extent such agency is authorized by statute to issue orders or guidance, the issuance of orders or guidance of general applicability that are publicly available and published (in the Federal Register in the case of an order or guidance issued by a Federal regulatory agency).
<br>
<br>This paragraph does not grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to issue regulations, orders, or guidance pursuant to any statute that does not authorize such issuance.
<br>(2) Limitations on interpretation authority
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a Federal regulatory agency shall not adopt any regulation, order, or guidance described in paragraph (1), and a State regulatory agency is preempted by section 7001 of this title from adopting any regulation, order, or guidance described in paragraph (1), unless—
<br>
<br>(A) such regulation, order, or guidance is consistent with section 7001 of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) such regulation, order, or guidance does not add to the requirements of such section; and
<br>
<br>(C) such agency finds, in connection with the issuance of such regulation, order, or guidance, that—
<br>
<br>(i) there is a substantial justification for the regulation, order, or guidance;
<br>
<br>(ii) the methods selected to carry out that purpose—
<br>
<br>(I) are substantially equivalent to the requirements imposed on records that are not electronic records; and
<br>
<br>(II) will not impose unreasonable costs on the acceptance and use of electronic records; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the methods selected to carry out that purpose do not require, or accord greater legal status or effect to, the implementation or application of a specific technology or technical specification for performing the functions of creating, storing, generating, receiving, communicating, or authenticating electronic records or electronic signatures.
<br>(3) Performance standards
<br>(A) Accuracy, record integrity, accessibility
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(C)(iii), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency may interpret section 7001(d) of this title to specify performance standards to assure accuracy, record integrity, and accessibility of records that are required to be retained. Such performance standards may be specified in a manner that imposes a requirement in violation of paragraph (2)(C)(iii) if the requirement (i) serves an important governmental objective; and (ii) is substantially related to the achievement of that objective. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to require use of a particular type of software or hardware in order to comply with section 7001(d) of this title.
<br>(B) Paper or printed form
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency may interpret section 7001(d) of this title to require retention of a record in a tangible printed or paper form if—
<br>
<br>(i) there is a compelling governmental interest relating to law enforcement or national security for imposing such requirement; and
<br>
<br>(ii) imposing such requirement is essential to attaining such interest.
<br>(4) Exceptions for actions by government as market participant
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2)(C)(iii) shall not apply to the statutes, regulations, or other rules of law governing procurement by the Federal or any State government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof.
<br>(c) Additional limitations
<br>(1) Reimposing paper prohibited
<br>
<br>Nothing in subsection (b) (other than paragraph (3)(B) thereof) shall be construed to grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to impose or reimpose any requirement that a record be in a tangible printed or paper form.
<br>(2) Continuing obligation under Government Paperwork Elimination Act
<br>
<br>Nothing in subsection (a) or (b) relieves any Federal regulatory agency of its obligations under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (title XVII of Public Law 105–277).
<br>(d) Authority to exempt from consent provision
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A Federal regulatory agency may, with respect to matter within its jurisdiction, by regulation or order issued after notice and an opportunity for public comment, exempt without condition a specified category or type of record from the requirements relating to consent in section 7001(c) of this title if such exemption is necessary to eliminate a substantial burden on electronic commerce and will not increase the material risk of harm to consumers.
<br>(2) Prospectuses
<br>
<br>Within 30 days after June 30, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall issue a regulation or order pursuant to paragraph (1) exempting from section 7001(c) of this title any records that are required to be provided in order to allow advertising, sales literature, or other information concerning a security issued by an investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.], or concerning the issuer thereof, to be excluded from the definition of a prospectus under section 77b(a)(10)(A) of this title.
<br>(e) Electronic letters of agency
<br>
<br>The Federal Communications Commission shall not hold any contract for telecommunications service or letter of agency for a preferred carrier change, that otherwise complies with the Commission's rules, to be legally ineffective, invalid, or unenforceable solely because an electronic record or electronic signature was used in its formation or authorization.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—TRANSFERABLE RECORDS
<br>§7021. Transferable records
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>(1) Transferable record
<br>
<br>The term "transferable record" means an electronic record that—
<br>
<br>(A) would be a note under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code if the electronic record were in writing;
<br>
<br>(B) the issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record; and
<br>
<br>(C) relates to a loan secured by real property.
<br>
<br>A transferable record may be executed using an electronic signature.
<br>(2) Other definitions
<br>
<br>The terms "electronic record", "electronic signature", and "person" have the same meanings provided in section 7006 of this title.
<br>(b) Control
<br>
<br>A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.
<br>(c) Conditions
<br>
<br>A system satisfies subsection (b), and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that—
<br>
<br>(1) a single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;
<br>
<br>(2) the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as—
<br>
<br>(A) the person to which the transferable record was issued; or
<br>
<br>(B) if the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable record was most recently transferred;
<br>
<br>(3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;
<br>
<br>(4) copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;
<br>
<br>(5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and
<br>
<br>(6) any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.
<br>(d) Status as holder
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in section 1–201(20) of the Uniform Commercial Code, of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under the Uniform Commercial Code, including, if the applicable statutory requirements under section 3–302(a), 9–308, or revised section 9–330 of the Uniform Commercial Code are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course or a purchaser, respectively. Delivery, possession, and endorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this subsection.
<br>(e) Obligor rights
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under the Uniform Commercial Code.
<br>(f) Proof of control
<br>
<br>If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control of the transferable record. Proof may include access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records sufficient to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the person having control of the transferable record.
