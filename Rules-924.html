<br>(2) Application of agreement between the United States and other countries
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) has accepted the obligations of the agreement with respect to the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) should not otherwise be denied the benefits of the agreement with respect to the United States because such country has not accorded adequate benefits, including substantially equal competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States to the extent required under section 2136(c) 1 of this title, to the United States.
<br>(3) Limitation on acceptance concerning major industrial countries
<br>

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the President may accept such an agreement, if he determines that only one major industrial country is not accepting that agreement and the acceptance of that agreement by that country is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement, and if—
<br>
<br>(A) that country is not a major factor in trade in the products covered by that agreement,
<br>
<br>(B) the President has authority to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country and has taken steps to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country, or
<br>
<br>(C) a significant portion of United States trade would benefit from the agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and the President determines and reports to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the agreement.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the acceptance of an agreement by the European Communities on behalf of its member countries shall also be treated as acceptance of that agreement by each member country, and acceptance of an agreement by all the member countries of the European Communities shall also be treated as acceptance of that agreement by the European Communities.

<br>
<br>Presidential Determination Regarding the Acceptance and Application of Certain International Trade Agreements
<br>
<br>1. Pursuant to section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112(b)), I, through my duly empowered representative, on April 12, 1979, entered into the international agreements negotiated in the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. These agreements were:
<br>
<br>(i) Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
<br>
<br>(ii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
<br>
<br>(iii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;
<br>
<br>(iv) Agreement on Government Procurement;
<br>
<br>(v) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade;
<br>
<br>(vi) Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures;
<br>
<br>(vii) Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft;
<br>
<br>(viii) International Dairy Arrangement; and
<br>
<br>(ix) Arrangement Regarding Bovine Meat.
<br>
<br>These agreements are collectively referred to herein as the "MTN agreements".
<br>
<br>2. In accordance with sections 102 and 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112 and 2191), the MTN agreements were submitted to Congress for its approval. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) [19 U.S.C. 2503] approves the MTN agreements and authorizes the President to accept each of the MTN agreements provided that the President determines that all, or all but one, of the major industrial countries (as defined in section 126(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(d)) is also accepting the agreement. If the President determines that only one major industrial country is not accepting an agreement, the President may nevertheless accept such an agreement if he determines that the acceptance of that agreement by that country is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement, and if:
<br>
<br>(A) that country is not a major factor in trade in the products covered by that agreement;
<br>
<br>(B) the President has authority to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country and has taken steps to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country; or
<br>
<br>(C) a significant portion of United States trade would benefit from the agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and the President determines and reports to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the agreement.
<br>
<br>3. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 also provides that no agreement accepted by the President shall apply between the United States and any other country unless the President determines that such country:
<br>
<br>(A) has accepted the obligations of the agreement with respect to the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) should not otherwise be denied the benefits of the agreement with respect to the United States because such country has not accorded adequate benefits, including substantially equal competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States to the extent required under section 126(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(c)), to the United States.
<br>
<br>4. Section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 (93 Stat. 151) [19 U.S.C. 1671], provides that the President must determine that certain conditions must be met before a country can be considered a "country under the Agreement" and, therefore, entitled to the injury determination provided for in section 703(a) and 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (93 Stat. 152 and 159) [19 U.S.C. 1671b(a) and 1671d(b)].
<br>
<br>5. Section 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 267) authorizes the President to proclaim certain modifications in the Tariff Schedules of the United States if the President determines that the conditions under section 2(b) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) [19 U.S.C. 2503(b)] on acceptance of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft have been fulfilled.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of sections 2 and 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147 and 267), herein referred to as "the Act", section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 (93 Stat. 151) [19 U.S.C. 1671], and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code do hereby

<br>(iii) in accordance with section 2(b)(3)(C) of the Act (93 Stat. 148), a significant portion of United States trade will benefit from these agreements, notwithstanding the anticipated short delay in acceptance by Japan, and it is in the national interest of the United States to accept these agreements.

<br>
<br>d. With respect to the Arrangement Regarding Bovine Meat, in accordance with section 2(b)(1) and (3) of the Act (93 Stat. 147), each major industrial country (as defined in section 126(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2136(d) is also accepting the agreement.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12849. Implementation of Agreement With European Community on Government Procurement
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12849, May 25, 1993, 58 F.R. 30931, provided:
<br>
<br>WHEREAS, the United States and the European Community (EC) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Government Procurement (Agreement) that provides appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS, the commitments made in the Agreement are intended to become part of an expanded General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Agreement on Government Procurement (GATT Code) and are an important step toward an expanded GATT Code;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS, as a result of these commitments, U.S. businesses will obtain increased access to EC member state procurement for U.S. goods and services;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS, I have determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act, as amended ([former] 41 U.S.C. 10a–10d) [see 41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.], to procurement covered by the Agreement;
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and title III of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2511–2518), and in order to implement the Agreement, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. In applying the provisions of the Buy American Act, the heads of the agencies listed in Annex 1, Parts A and B, of this order are requested, as of the date of this order, to apply no price differential between articles, materials, or supplies of U.S. origin and those originating in the member states of the EC.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. For purposes of this order, the rule of origin specified in section 308 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2518), shall apply in determining whether goods originate in the member states of the EC.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. This order shall apply only to solicitations, issued by agencies listed in Annex 1, Parts A and B, of this order, above the threshold amounts set forth in Annex 2.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. This order shall apply to solicitations outstanding on the date of this order, except for those for which the initial deadline for receipt of bids or proposals has passed, and to all solicitations issued after the date of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Except for procurements by the Department of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) shall be responsible for interpretation of the Agreement. The USTR shall seek the advice of the interagency organization established under section 242(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1872(a)) and consult with affected agencies, including the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. This Executive order is effective immediately. Although regulatory implementation of this order must await revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), it is expected that agencies listed in Annex 1, Parts A and B, of this order will take all appropriate actions in the interim to implement those aspects of the order that are not dependent upon regulatory revision.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Pursuant to section 25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended ([former] 41 U.S.C. 421(a)) [now 41 U.S.C. 1302, 1303], the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated in the FAR within 30 days from the date this order is issued.

<br>§2512. Authority to encourage reciprocal competitive procurement practices
<br>(a) Authority to bar procurement from non-designated countries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), the President, in order to encourage additional countries to become parties to the Agreement and to provide appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to United States products and suppliers of such products—
<br>
<br>(A) shall, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, prohibit the procurement, after the date on which any waiver under section 2511(a) of this title first takes effect, of products—
<br>
<br>(i) which are products of a foreign country or instrumentality which is not designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(ii) which would otherwise be eligible products; and
<br>
<br>(B) may, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, take such other actions within the President's authority as the President deems necessary.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of procurements for which—
<br>
<br>(A) there are no offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products; or
<br>
<br>(B) the offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the United States Government.
<br>(b) Deferrals and waivers
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a), but in furtherance of the objective of encouraging countries to become parties to the Agreement and provide appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to United States products and suppliers of such products, the President may—
<br>
<br>(1) waive the prohibition required by subsection (a)(1) on procurement of products of a foreign country or instrumentality which has not yet become a party to the Agreement but—
<br>
<br>(A) has agreed to apply transparent and competitive procedures to its government procurement equivalent to those in the Agreement, and
<br>
<br>(B) maintains and enforces effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with its government procurement;
<br>
<br>(2) authorize agency heads to waive, subject to interagency review and general policy guidance by the organization established under section 1872(a) of this title, such prohibition on a case-by-case basis when in the national interest; and
<br>
<br>(3) authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive, subject to interagency review and policy guidance by the organization established under section 1872(a) of this title, such prohibition for products of any country or instrumentality which enters into a reciprocal procurement agreement with the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>Before exercising the waiver authority under paragraph (1), the President shall consult with the appropriate private sector advisory committees established under section 2155 of this title and with the appropriate committees of the Congress.
<br>(c) Report on impact of restrictions
<br>(1) Impact on the economy
<br>
<br>On or before July 1, 1981, the President shall report to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate on the effects on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget) of the refusal of developed countries to allow the Agreement to cover the entities of the governments of such countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors.
<br>(2) Recommendations for attaining reciprocity
<br>
<br>The report required by paragraph (1) shall include an evaluation of alternative means to obtain equity and reciprocity in such product sectors, including (A) prohibiting the procurement of products of such countries by United States entities not covered by the Agreement, and (B) modifying the application of chapter 83 of title 41. The report shall include an analysis of the effect of such alternative means on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget), and on successful negotiations on the expansion of the coverage of the Agreement pursuant to section 2514(a) and (b) of this title, other trade negotiating objectives, the relationship of the Federal Government to State and local governments, and such other factors as the President deems appropriate.
<br>(3) Consultation
<br>
<br>In the preparation of the report required by paragraph (1) and the evaluation and analysis required by paragraph (2), the President shall consult with representatives of the public, industry, and labor, and make available pertinent, nonconfidential information obtained in the course of such preparation to the advisory committees established pursuant to section 2155 of this title.
<br>(d) Proposed action
<br>(1) Presidential report
<br>
<br>On or before October 1, 1981, the President shall prepare and transmit to the congressional committees referred to in subsection (c)(1) a report which describes the actions he deems appropriate to establish reciprocity with major industrialized countries in the area of Government procurement.
<br>(2) Procedure
<br>(A) Presidential determination
<br>
<br>If the President determines that any changes in existing law or new statutory authority are required to authorize or to implement any action proposed in the report submitted under paragraph (1), he shall, on or after January 1, 1982, submit to the Congress a bill to accomplish such changes or provide such new statutory authority. Prior to submitting such a bill, the President shall consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress having jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such action, and shall submit to such committees a proposed draft of such bill.
<br>(B) Congressional consideration
<br>
<br>The appropriate committee of each House of the Congress shall give a bill submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) prompt consideration and shall make its best efforts to take final committee action on such bill in an expeditious manner.

<br>§2514. Expansion of the coverage of the Agreement
<br>(a) Overall negotiating objective
<br>
<br>The President shall seek in the renegotiations provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement more open and equitable market access abroad, and the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of devices which distort trade or commerce related to Government procurement, with the overall goal of maximizing the economic benefit to the United States through maintaining and enlarging foreign markets for products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, the development of fair and equitable market opportunities, and open and nondiscriminatory world trade. In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the President shall consider the assessment made in the report required under section 2516(a) 1 of this title.
<br>(b) Sector negotiating objectives
<br>
<br>The President shall seek, consistent with the overall objective set forth in subsection (a) and to the maximum extent feasible, with respect to appropriate product sectors, competitive opportunities for the export of United States products to the developed countries of the world equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded by the United States, taking into account all barriers to, and other distortions of, international trade affecting that sector.
<br>(c) Independent verification objective
<br>
<br>The President shall seek to establish in the renegotiation provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement a system for independent verification of information provided by parties to the Agreement to the Committee on Government Procurement pursuant to article XIX(5) of the Agreement.
<br>(d) Reports on negotiations

<br>
<br>If, during the renegotiations of the Agreement, the President at any time determines that the renegotiations are not progressing satisfactorily and are not likely to result, within twelve months of the commencement thereof, in an expansion of the Agreement to cover purchases by the entities of the governments of developed countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors, he shall so report to the congressional committees referred to in section 2512(c)(1) of this title. Taking into account the objectives set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and the factors required to be analyzed under section 2512(c) of this title, the President shall further report to such committees appropriate actions to seek reciprocity in such product sectors with such countries in the area of government procurement.
<br>(2) Legislative recommendations
<br>
<br>Taking into account the factors required to be analyzed under section 2512(c) of this title, the President may recommend to the Congress legislation (with respect to entities of the Government which are not covered by the Agreement) which may prohibit such entities from purchasing products of such countries.
<br>(3) Annual reports
<br>
<br>Each annual report of the President under section 163(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2213(a)] made after July 26, 1979 shall report the actions, if any, the President deemed appropriate to establish reciprocity in appropriate product sectors with major industrial countries in the area of government procurement.
<br>(e) Extension of nondiscrimination and national treatment
<br>
<br>Before exercising the waiver authority in section 2511 of this title for procurement not covered by the Agreement on the date it enters into force with respect to the United States, the President shall follow the consultation provisions of section 135 [19 U.S.C. 2155] and chapter 6 of title I of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2211 et seq.] for private sector and congressional consultations.

<br>
<br>"(B)(i) are signatories to the Agreement; (ii) are in compliance with the Agreement but, in the government procurement of products or services not covered by the Agreement, maintain a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses; and (iii) whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government; or

<br>
<br>"(i) use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurements that could have been conducted using competitive procedures;

<br>
<br>"(iv) use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of United States suppliers to participate in procurements; and

<br>
<br>"(6) Impact of noncompliance.—The President shall take into account, in identifying countries in the annual report and in any action required by this section, the relative impact of any noncompliance with the Agreement or of other discrimination on United States commerce and the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the ability of United States suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.
<br>
<br>"(7) Impact on procurement costs.—Such report shall also include an analysis of the impact on United States Government procurement costs that may occur as a consequence of any sanctions that may be required by subsection (f) or (g) of this section.

<br>"(1) Initiation of dispute settlement procedures.—If, within 60 days after the annual report is submitted under subsection (d)(1) of this section, a signatory country identified pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section has not complied with the Agreement, then the United States Trade Representative shall promptly request proceedings on the matter under the formal dispute settlement procedures provided under the Agreement unless such proceedings are already underway pursuant to the identification of the signatory country under subsection (d)(1) of this section as not in compliance in a preceding annual report.
<br>
<br>"(2) Settlement of disputes.—If, before the end of a year following the initiation of dispute settlement procedures—
<br>

<br>
<br>"(B) the other participant to the procedures takes the action recommended as a result of the procedures to the satisfaction of the President, or

<br>
<br>the President shall take no action to limit Government procurement from that participant.
<br>
<br>"(3) Sanctions after failure of dispute resolution.—If the dispute settlement procedures initiated pursuant to this subsection with any signatory country to the Agreement are not concluded within one year from their initiation or the country has not met the requirements of paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B), then—

<br>"(B) modify or restrict the application of either or both such sanctions, subject to such terms and conditions as the President considers appropriate; or

<br>"(5) Termination of sanctions and reinstatement of waivers.—The President may terminate the sanctions imposed under paragraph (3) or (4), reinstate the waiver of discriminatory purchasing requirements granted to that signatory country pursuant to section 2511(a) of this title, and remove that country from the report under subsection (d)(1) of this section at such time as the President determines that—
<br>
<br>"(A) the signatory country has complied with the Agreement;
<br>
<br>"(B) the signatory country has taken corrective action as a result of the dispute settlement procedures to the satisfaction of the President; or
<br>

<br>
<br>"(A) the President shall identify such country as a country that maintains, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the prohibition on procurement contained in section 10b–1 of title 41 shall apply to such country.
<br>
<br>"(2) Withholding and modification of sanctions.—If the President determines that imposing or continuing the sanction required by paragraph (1) would harm the public interest of the United States, the President may, to the extent necessary to impose appropriate limitations that are equivalent, in their effect, to the discrimination against United States products or services in government procurement by that country, modify or restrict the application of such sanction, subject to such terms and conditions as the President considers appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(3) Termination of sanctions.—The President may terminate the sanctions imposed under paragraph (1) or (2) and remove a country from the report under subsection (d)(1) of this section at such time as the President determines that the country has eliminated the discrimination identified pursuant to subsection (d)(2)(B) or (C) of this section.
