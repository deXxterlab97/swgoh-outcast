<br>Prophecy of Osee
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The word of the Lord, that came to Osee, the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel.
<br>2	The beginning of the Lord’s speaking by Osee: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord.
<br>3	So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived, and bore him a son.
<br>4	And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezrahel: for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
<br>5	And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.
<br>6	And she conceived again, and bore a daugh- ter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy: for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.
<br>7	And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord, their God: and I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.
<br>8	And she weaned her that was called Without
<br> 
<br>mercy. And she conceived, and bore a son.
<br>9	And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.
<br>10	And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: Ye are the sons of the living God.
<br>11	And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel, shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Say ye to your brethren: You are my people: and to your sister: Thou hast obtained mercy.
<br>2	Judge your mother, judge her: because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts.
<br>3	Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born: and I will make her as a wilderness, and will set her as a land that none can pass through and will kill her with drought. 4 And I will not have mercy on her children.
<br>for they are the children of fornications.
<br>5	For their mother hath committed fornica-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tion, she that conceived them is covered with shame: for she said: I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink.
<br>6	Wherefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths.
<br>7	And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, and shall not find, and she shall say: I will go, and return to my first husband: because it was better with me then than now.
<br>8	And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver, and gold, which they have used in the service of Baal. 9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its season, and I will set at liberty my wool, and my flax, which
<br>covered her disgrace.
<br>10	And now I will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers: and no man shall deliver her out of my hand:
<br>11	And I will cause all her mirth to cease, her solemnities, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festival times.
<br>12	And I will destroy her vines, and her fig trees, of which she said: These are my rewards, which my lovers have given me: and I will make her as a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour her.
<br>13	And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, to whom she burnt incense, and decked herself out with her earrings, and with her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.
<br>14	Therefore, behold I will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness: and I will speak to her heart.
<br>15	And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place, and the valley of Achor for an open-
<br> 
<br>ing of hope: and she shall sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt. 16 And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord:
<br>That she shall call me: My husband, and she shall call me no more Banli.
<br>17	And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and she shall no more remem- ber their name.
<br>18	And in that day I will make a covenant with them, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth: and I will destroy the bow, and the sword, and war out of the land: and I will make them sleep secure.
<br>19	And I will espouse thee to me for ever: and I will espouse thee to me in justice, and judg- ment, and in mercy, and in commiserations.
<br>20	And I will espouse thee to me in faith: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
<br>21	And it shall come to pass in that day: I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth.
<br>22	And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and these shall hear Jezrahel. 23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy on her that was without
<br>mercy.
<br>24 And I will say to that which is not my people: Thou art my people: and they shall say: Thou art my God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And the Lord said to me: Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress: as the Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the grapes.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core of barley.
<br>3	And I said to her: Thou shalt wait for me many days: thou shalt not play tbe harlot, and thou shalt be no man’s, and I also will wait for thee.
<br>4	For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod, and without theraphim.
<br>5	And after this the children of Israel shall return and shall seek the Lord, their God, and David, their king: and they shall fear the Lord, and his goodness, in the last days.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.
<br>2	Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery, have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.
<br>3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the heat of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.
<br>4	But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.
<br>5	And thou shalt fall today, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.
<br>6	My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected
<br> 
<br>knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
<br>7	According to the multitude of them, so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
<br>8	They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity.
<br>9	And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.
<br>10	And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing the law.
<br>11	Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness, take away the understanding.
<br>12	My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them, and they have committed fornication against their God.
<br>13	They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt incense upon the hills: un- der the oak, and the poplar, and the turpen- tine tree, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters commit fornica- tion, aud your spouses shall be adulteresses.
<br>14	I will not visit upon your daughters, when they shall commit fornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: be- cause themselves conversed with harlots, and of- fered sacrifice with the effeminate, and the peo- ple that doth not understand shall be beaten.
<br>15	If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend: and go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not swear: The Lord liveth.
<br>16	For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a spacious place.
<br>17	Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone.
<br>18	Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication: they that should have pro- tected them have loved to bring shame upon them.
<br>19	The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be confounded because of their sacrifices.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over and a net spread upon Thabor. O priests... What is said of priests in this prophecy is chiefly understood of the priests of the king- dom of Israel; who were not true priests of the race of Aaron; but served the calves at Bethel and Dan.
<br>2	And you have turned aside victims into the depth and I am the teacher of them all.
<br>3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me for now Ephraim hath committed fornica- tion, Israel is defiled.
<br>4	They will not set their thoughts to return to their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.
<br>5	And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel, and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Juda also shall fall with them.
<br>6	With their flocks and with their herds, they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find him: he is withdrawn from them.
<br>7	They have transgressed against the Lord: for
<br> 
<br>they have begotten children that are strangers: now shall a month devour them with their por- tions.
<br>8	Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa, the trumpet in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back, O Benjamin.
<br>9	Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be.
<br>10	The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
<br>11	Ephraim is under oppression, and broken in judgment: because he began to go after filth- iness.
<br>12	And I will be like a moth to Ephraim: and like rottenness to the house of Juda.
<br>13	And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda his band: and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to the avenging king: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to take off the band from you.
<br>14	For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion’s whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will catch, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can rescue.
<br>15	I will go and return to my place: until you are consumed, and seek my face.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>In their affliction they will rise early to me: Come, and let us return to the Lord.
<br>2	For he hath taken us, and he will heal us: he will strike, and he will cure us.
<br>3	He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. We shall know, and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His going forth is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>prepared as the morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth. 4 What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, O Juda? your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away
<br>in the morning.
<br>5	For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth as the light.
<br>6	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.
<br>7	But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, there have they dealt treacherously against me.
<br>8	Galaad is a city of workers of idols, sup- planted with blood.
<br>9	And like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the priests who murder in the way those that pass out of Sichem: for they have wrought wickedness.
<br>11 And thou also, O Juda, set thee a harvest, when I shall bring back the captivity of my peo- ple.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they have committed falsehood, and the thief is come in to steal, the robber is without.
<br>2	And lest they may say in their hearts, that I remember all their wickedness: their own devices now have beset them about, they have been done before my face.
<br>3	They have made the king glad with their wickedness: and the princes with their lies.
<br>4	They are all adulterers, like an oven heated
<br> 
<br>by the baker: the city rested a little from the mingling of the leaven, till the whole was leav- ened.
<br>5	The day of our king, the princes began to be mad with wine: he stretched out his hand with scorners.
<br>6	Because they have applied their heart like an oven, when he laid snares for them: he slept all the night baking them, in the morning he himself was heated as a flaming fire.
<br>7	They were all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings have fallen: there is none amongst them that calleth unto me.
<br>8	Ephraim himself is mixed among the na- tions: Ephraim is become as bread baked under the ashes, that is not turned.
<br>9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knew it not: yea, grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is ignorant of it.
<br>10	And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face: and they have not returned to the Lord their God, nor have they sought him in all these.
<br>11	And Ephraim is become as a dove that is decoyed, not having a heart: they called upon Egypt, they went to the Assyrians.
<br>12	And when they shall go, I will spread my net upon them: I will bring them down as the fowl of the air, I will strike them as their congre- gation hath heard.
<br>13	Woe to them, for they have departed from me: they shall be wasted because they have transgressed against me: and I redeemed them: and they have spoken lies against me.
<br>14	And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howled in their beds: they have thought upon wheat and wine, they are departed from me.
<br>15	And I have chastised them, and strength- ened their arms: and they have imagined evil
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>against me.
<br>16	They returned, that they might be without yoke: they became like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue. This is their derision in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law.
<br>2	They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee.
<br>3	lsrael hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him.
<br>4	They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish.
<br>5	Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed?
<br>6	For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders’ webs.
<br>7	For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirl- wind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; and if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.
<br>8	Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.
<br>9	For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.
<br>10	But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the
<br> 
<br>king, and the princes.
<br>11	Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.
<br>12	I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.
<br>13	They shall offer victims, they shall sacri- fice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniq- uity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.
<br>14	And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Rejoice not, O Israel: rejoice not as the nations do: for thou hast committed fornication against thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
<br>2	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the wine shall deceive them.
<br>3	They shall not dwell in the Lord’s land: Ephraim is returned to Egypt, and hath eaten unclean things among the Assyrians.
<br>4	They shall not offer wine to the Lord, neither shall they please him: their sacrifices shall be like the bread of mourners: all that shall eat it shall be defiled: for their bread is life for their soul, it shall not enter into the house of the Lord.
<br>5	What will you do in the solemn day, in the day of the feast of the Lord?
<br>6	For behold they are gone because of destruc- tion: Egypt shall gather them together, Mem- phis shall bury them: nettles shall inherit their beloved silver, the bur shall be in their taberna- cles.
<br>7	The days of visitation are come, the days
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of repaying are come: know ye, O Israel, that the prophet was foolish, the spiritual man was mad, for the multitude of thy iniquity, and the multitude of thy madness.
<br>8	The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: the prophet is become a snare of ruin upon all his ways, madness is in the house of his God. 9 They have sinned deeply, as in the days of Gabaa: he will remember their iniquity, and wilI
<br>visit their sin.
<br>11	As for Ephraim, their glory hath flown away like bird from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
<br>12	And though they should bring up their chil- dren, I will make them without children among men: yea, and woe to them, when I shall depart from them.
<br>13	Ephraim, as I saw, was a Tyre, founded in beauty: and Ephraim shall bring out his children to the murderer.
<br>14	Give them, O Lord. What wilt thou give them? Give them a womb without children, and dry breasts.
<br>15	All their wickedness is in Galgal, for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their devices I will cast them forth out of my house: I will love them no more, all their princes are revolters.
<br>16	Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they shall yield no fruit. And if they should have issue, I will slay the best beloved fruit of their womb.
<br>17	My God will cast them away, because they hearkened not to him: and they shall be wan- derers among the nations.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Israel a vine full of branches, the fruit is agree- able to it: according to the multitude of his fruit,
<br> 
<br>he hath multiplied altars, according to the plenty of his land he hath abounded with idols.
<br>2	Their heart is divided: now they shall perish: he shall break down their idols, he shall destroy their altars.
<br>3	For now they shall say: We have no king: because we fear not the Lord: and what shall a king do to us?
<br>4	You speak words of an unprofitable vision, and you shall make a covenant: and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of the field.
<br>5	The inhabitants of Samaria have worshipped the kine of Bethaven: for the people thereof have mourned over it, and the wardens of its temple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from it.
<br>6	For itself also is carried into Assyria, a present to the avenging king: shame shall fall upon Ephraim, and Israel shall be confounded in his own will.
<br>7	Samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the water.
<br>8	And the high places of the idol, the sin of Israel shall be destroyed: the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars: and they shall say to the mountains Cover us; and to the hills: Fall upon us.
<br>9	From the days of Gabaa, Israel hath sinned, there they stood: the battle in Gabaa against the children of iniquity shall not overtake them.
<br>10	According to my desire, I will chastise them: and the nations shall be gathered together against them, when they shall be chastised for their two iniquities.
<br>11	Ephraim is a heifer taught to love to tread out corn, but I passed over upon the beauty of her neck: I will ride upon Ephraim, Juda shall plough, Jacob shall break the furrows for himself.
<br>12	Sow for yourselves in justice, and reap
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>in the mouth of mercy, break up your fallow ground: but the time to seek the Lord is, when he shall come that shall teach you justice.
<br>13	You have ploughed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lying: because thou hast trusted in thy ways, in the multitude of thy strong ones.
<br>14	A tumult shall arise among thy people: and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed as Salmana was destroyed, by the house of him that judged Baal in the day of battle, the mother being dashed in pieces upon her children.
<br>15	So hath Bethel done to you, because of the evil of your iniquities.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>As the morning passeth, so hath the king of Is- rael passed away. Because Israel was a child, and I loved him:  and I called my son out of Egypt.
<br>2	As they called them, they went away from before their face: they offered victims to Baalim, and sacrificed to idols.
<br>3	And I was like a foster father to Ephraim, I carried them in my arms: and they knew not that I healed them.
<br>4	I will draw them with the cords of Adam, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as one that taketh off the yoke on their jaws: and I put his meat to him that he might eat.
<br>5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king: because they would not be converted.
<br>6	The sword hath begun in his cities, and it shall consume his chosen men, and shall devour their heads.
<br>7	And my people shall long for my return: but a yoke shall be put upon them together, which shall not be taken off.
<br> 
<br>8	How shall I deal with thee, O Ephraim, shall I protect thee, O Israel? how shall I make thee as Adama, shall I set thee as Seboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentance is stirred up. 9 I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath:
<br>I will not return to destroy Ephraim: because I am God, and not man: the holy one in the midst of thee, and I will not enter into the city.
<br>10	They shall walk after the Lord, he shall roar as a lion: because he shall roar, and the children of the sea shall fear.
<br>11	And they shall fly away like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will place them in their own houses, saith the Lord.
<br>12	Ephraim hath compassed me about with denials, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Juda went down as a witness with God, and is faithful with the saints.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>
<br>Ephraim feedeth on the wind, and followeth the burning heat: all the day long he multiplied lies and desolation: and he hath made a covenant with the Assyrians, and carried oil into Egypt.
<br>2	Therefore there is a judgment of the Lord with Juda, and a visitation for Jacob: he will render to him according to his ways, and accord- ing to his devices.
<br>3	In the womb he supplanted his brother: and by his strength he had success with an angel.
<br>4	And he prevailed over the angel, and was strengthened: he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us.
<br>5	Even the Lord God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and hope in thy God always.
<br>7	He is like Chanaan, there is a deceitful bal- ance in his hand, he hath loved oppression.
<br>8	And Ephraim said: But yet I am become rich, I have found me an idol: all my labours shall not find me the iniquity that I have committed. 9 And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, will yet cause thee to dwell in
<br>tabernacles, as in the days of the feast.
<br>10	And I have spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and I have used simili- tudes by the ministry of the prophets.
<br>11	If Galaad be an idol, then in vain were they in Galgal offering sacrifices with bullocks: for their altars also are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
<br>12	Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and was a keeper for a wife.
<br>13	But the Lord by a prophet brought Israel out of Egypt: and he was preserved by a prophet. 14 Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath with his bitterness, and his blood shall come upon him, and his Lord will render his reproach unto
<br>him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>When Ephraim spoke, a horror seized Israel: and he sinned in Baal, and died.
<br>2	And now they have sinned more and more: and they have made to themselves a molten thing of their silver as the likeness of idols: the whole is the work of craftsmen: to these that say: Sac- rifice men, ye that adore calves.
<br>3	Therefore they shall be as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the dust that is driven with a whirlwind out of the
<br> 
<br>floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
<br>4	But I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt know no God but me, and there is no saviour beside me.
<br>5	I knew thee in the desert, in the land of the wilderness.
<br>6	According to their pastures they were filled, and were made full: and they lifted up their heart, and have forgotten me.
<br>7	And I will be to them as a lioness, as a leop- ard in the way of the Assyrians.
<br>8	I will meet them as a bear that is robbed of her whelps,  and I will rend the inner parts of their liver: and I will devour them there as a lion, the beast of the field shall tear them.
<br>9	Destruction is thy own, O Israel: thy help is only in me.
<br>10	Where is thy king? now especially let him save thee in all thy cities: and thy judges, of whom thou saidst: Give me kings and princes.
<br>11	I will give thee a king in my wrath, and will take him away iu my indignation.
<br>12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, his sin is hidden.
<br>13	The sorrows of a woman in labour shall come upon him, he is an unwise son: for now he shall not stand in the breach of the children.
<br>14	I will deliver them out of the hand of death. I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy death; O hell, I will be thy bite: comfort is hidden from my eyes.
<br>15	Because he shall make a separation be- tween brothers: the Lord will bring a burning wind that shall rise from the desert, and it shall dry up his springs, and shall make his fountain desolate, and he shall carry off the treasure of every desirable vessel.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Let Samaria perish, becsuse she hath stirred up her God to bitterness: let them perish by the sword, let their little ones be dashed, and let the women with child be ripped up.
<br>2	Return, O Israel, to the Lord thy God: for thou hast fallen down by thy iniquity.
<br>3	Take with you words, and return to the Lord, and say to him: Take away all iniquity, and receive the good: and we will render the calves of our lips.
<br>4	Assyria shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more: The works of our hands are our gods: for thou wilt have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee.
<br>5	I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely: for my wrath is turned away from them. 6 I will be as the dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall shoot forth as that of
<br>Libanus.
<br>7	His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree: and his smell as that of Libanus.
<br>8	They shall be converted that sit under his shadow: they shall live upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine: his memorial shall be as the wine of Libanus.
<br>9	Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree: from me is thy fruit found.
<br>10	Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know these things? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall in them.

<br>
<br>Prophecy of Joel
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The word of the Lord, that came to Joel, the son of Phatuel.
<br>2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land: did this ever happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
<br>3	Tell ye of this to your children, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.
<br>4	That which the palmerworm hath left, the locust hath eaten: and that which the locust hath left, the bruchus hath eaten: and that which tbe bruchus hath left, the mildew hath destroyed.
<br>5	Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take delight; in drinking sweet wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.
<br>6	For a nation come up upon my land, strong, and without number: his teeth are like the teeth of a lion: and his cheek teeth as of a lion’s whelp. 7 He hath laid my vineyard waste, and hath pilled off the bark of my fig tree: he hath stripped it bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are
<br>made white.
<br>8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
<br>9	Sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the Lord: the priests, the Lord’s minis- ters, have mourned:
<br>10	The country is destroyed, the ground hath
<br> 
<br>mourned: for the corn is wasted, the wine is con- founded, the oil hath languished.
<br>11	The husbandmen are ashamed, the vine- dressers have howled for the wheat, and for the barley, because the harvest of the field is per- ished.
<br>12	The vineyard is confounded, and the fig tree hath languished: the pomegranate tree, and the palm tree, and the apple tree, and all the trees of the field are withered: because joy is withdrawn from the children of men.
<br>13	Gird yourselves, and lament, O ye priests, howl, ye ministers of the altars: go in, lie in sack- cloth, ye ministers of my God: because sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your God.
<br>14	Sanctify ye a fast, call an assembly, gather together the ancients, all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God: and cry ye to the Lord:
<br>15	Ah, ah, ah, for the day: because the day of the Lord is at hand, and it shall come like destruction from the mighty.
<br>17	The beasts have rotted in their dung, the barns are destroyed, the storehouses are broken down: because the corn is confounded.
<br>18	Why did the beasts groan, why did the herds of cattle low? because there is no pasture for them: yea, and the flocks of sheep are per- ished.
<br>19	To thee, O Lord, will I cry: because fire
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilder- ness: and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the country.
<br>20	Yea, and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a garden bed that thirsteth af- ter rain, for the springs of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because the day of the Lord cometh, because it is nigh at hand.
<br>2	A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the moun- tains: the like to it hath not been from the be- ginning, nor shall be after it, even to the years of generation and generation.
<br>3	Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a gar- den of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can es- cape it.
<br>4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen.
<br>5	They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle.
<br>6	At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a ket- tle.
<br>7	They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks.
<br> 
<br>8	No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm.
<br>9	They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows, as a thief.
<br>10	At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.
<br>11	And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceed- ingly great, for they are strong, and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it?
<br>12	Now, therefore, saith the Lord. Be con- verted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and mourning.
<br>13	And rend your hearts, and not your gar- ments and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil.
<br>14	Who knoweth but he will return, and for- give, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God?
<br>15	Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,
<br>16	Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bridal chamber.
<br>17	Between the porch and the altar the priests, the Lord’s ministers, shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritane to reproach, that the hea- thens should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God?
<br>18	The Lord hath been zealons for his land,
<br> 
<br>
<br>1140	Prophecy of  Joel
<br>
<br> 
<br>and hath spared his people.
<br>20 And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rotten- ness shall go up, because he hath done proudly. 21 Fear not, O land, be g1ad, and rejoice: for
<br>the Lord hath done great things.
<br>22	Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength.
<br>23	And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning.
<br>24	And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overfiow with wine, and oil. 25 And I will restore to you the years which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm hath eaten; my great host which
<br>I sent upon you.
<br>26	And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God; who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.
<br>27	And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord yonr God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be con- founded forever.
<br>28	And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
<br>29	Moreover, upon my servants and hand- maids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.
<br> 
<br>30	And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.
<br>31	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dread- ful day of the Lord doth come.
<br>32	And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved: for in Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>For behold in those days, and in that time when I shall bring back the captivity of Juda, and Jerusalem:
<br>2	I will gather together all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: and I will plead with them there for my people, and for my inheritance, Israel, whom they have scat- tered among the nations, and have parted my land.
<br>3	And they have cast lots upon my people: and the boy they have put in the stews, and the girl they have sold for wine, that they might drink.
<br>4	But what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coast of the Philistines? will you revenge yourselves on me? and if you revenge yourselves on me, I will very soon return you a recompense upon your own head.
<br>5	For you have taken away my silver, and my gold: and my desirable, and most beantiful things you have carried into your temples.
<br>6	And the children of Juda, and the children of Jerusalem, you have sold to the children of the Greeks, that you might remove them far off from their own country.
<br>7	Behold, I will raise them up out of the place
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>wherein you have sold them: and I will return your recompense upon your own heads.
<br>8	And I will sell yonr sons, and your daughters, by the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far off, for the Lord hath spoken it.
<br>9	Proclaim ye this among the nations: Prepare war, raise up the strong: let them come, let all the men of war come up.
<br>10	Cut your ploughshares into swords, and your spades into spears. Let the weak say: I am strong.
<br>11	Break forth, and come, all ye nations from round about, and gather yourselves together: there will the Lord cause all thy strong ones to fall down.
<br>12	Let them arise, and let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I will sit to judge all nations round about.
<br>13	Put ye in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe: come and go down, for the press is full, the fats run over: for their wickedness is multiplied.
<br>14	Nations, nations in the valley of destruc- tion: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of destruction.
<br>15	The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.
<br>16	And the Lord shall roar out of Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the heavens and the earth shall be moved, and the Lord shall be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.
<br>17	And you shall know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Sion, my holy monntain: and Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall pass through it no more.
<br>18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweetness, aud the hills shall flow with milk: and waters shall flow through all the rivers of Juda: and a foun-
<br> 
<br>tain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the torrent of thorns.
<br>19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a wilderness destroyed: because they have done unjustly against the children of Juda, and have shed innocent blood in their land.
<br>20	And Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.
<br>21	And I will cleanse their blood, which I had not cleansed: and the Lord will dwell in Sion.

<br>
<br>
<br>Prophecy of Amos
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The words of Amos, who was among the herds- men of Thecua: which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two years before the earthquake.
<br>2	And he said: The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned, and the top of Carmel is withered.
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four I will not convert it: because they have thrashed Galaad with iron wains.
<br>4	And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the houses of Benadad.
<br>5	And I will break the bar of Damascus: and I will cut off the inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria shall be carried away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.
<br>6	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four I will not convert it: because they have carried away a perfect captivity to shut them up in Edom.
<br>7	And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the houses thereof.
<br>8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azo- tus, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon:  and I will turn my hand  against Ac-
<br> 
<br>caron, and the rest of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.
<br>9	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four I will not convert it: be- cause they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom, and have not remembered the covenant of brethren.
<br>10	And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the houses thereof.
<br>11	Thus saith the Lord:   For three crimes of Edom, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath pursued his brother with the sword, and hath carried on his fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.
<br>12	I will send a fire into Theman: and it shall devour the houses of Bosra.
<br>13	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath ripped up the women with child of Galaad to enlarge his bor- der.
<br>14	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it shall devour the houses thereof with shout- ing in the day of battle, and with a whirlwind in the day of trouble.
<br>15	And Melchom shall go into captivity, both he, and his princes together, saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Moab, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath burnt the bones of the king of Edom even to ashes.
<br>2	And I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the houses of Carioth: and Moab shall die with a noise, with the sound of the trumpet:
<br>3	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all his princes with him, saith the Lord.
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Juda, and for four I will not convert him: be- cause he hath cast away the law of the Lord, and hath not kept his commandments: for their idols have caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked.
<br>5	And I will send a fire into Juda, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem.
<br>6	Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Is- rael, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath sold the just man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of shoes.
<br>7	They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the humble: and the son and his father have gone to the same young woman, to profane my holy name.
<br>8	And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar: and drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.
<br>9	Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face: whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was strong as an oak: and I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots beneath.
<br>10	It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years through the wilderness, that you might possess the land of the Amorrhite.
<br> 
<br>11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?
<br>12	And you will present wine to the Nazarites: and command the prophets, saying: Prophesy not.
<br>13	Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden with hay.
<br>14	And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant shall not possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his life.
<br>15	And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, nei- ther shall the rider of the horse save his life.
<br>16	And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in that day, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken con- cerning you, O ye children of Israel: concerning the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:
<br>2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.
<br>3	Shall two walk together except they be agreed?
<br>4	Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey? will the lion’s whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
<br>5	Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if there be no fowler? Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat?
<br>6	Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	For the Lord God doth nothing without re- vealing his secret to his servants the prophets.
<br>8	The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy? 9 Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms
<br>thereof.
<br>10	And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.
<br>11	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in tribulation, and shall be com- passed about: and thy strength shall be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.
<br>12	Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of the lion’s mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a place of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.
<br>13	Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God of hosts:
<br>14	That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.
<br>15	And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the houses of ivory shall per- ish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Hear this word, ye fat kine that are in the moun- tains of Samaria: you that oppress the needy, and crush the poor: that say to your masters:
<br> 
<br>Bring, and we will drink.
<br>2	The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and what shall remain of you in boiling pots.
<br>3	And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other, and you shall be cast forth into Armon, saith the Lord.
<br>4	Come ye to Bethel, and do wickedly: to Gal- gal, and multiply transgressions: and bring in the morning your victims, your tithes in three days.
<br>5	And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven: and call free offerings, and proclaim it: for so you would do, O children of Israel, saith the Lord God.
<br>6	Whereupon I also have given you dulness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet you have not returned to me, saith the Lord.
<br>7	I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon on city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon: and the piece whereupon I rained not, withered.
<br>8	And two and three cities went to one city to drink water, and were not filled: yet you re- turned not to me, saith the Lord.
<br>9	I struck you with a burning wind, and with mildew, the palmerworm hath eaten up your many gardens, and your vineyards: your olive groves, and fig groves: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.
<br>10	I sent death upon you in the way of Egypt, I slew your young men with the sword, even to the captivity of your horses: and I made the stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.
<br>11	I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Sodom and Gomorrha, and you were as a fire- brand plucked out of the burning: yet you re- turned not to me, saith the Lord.
<br>12	Therefore I will do these things to thee, O Israel: and after I shall have done these things to thee, be prepared to meet thy God, O Israel. 13 For behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind, and declareth his word to man, he that maketh the morning mist, and walketh upon the high places of the earth: the
<br>Lord the God of hosts is his name.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.
<br>2	The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.
<br>3	For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.
<br>4	For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live.
<br>5	But seek not Bethel, and go not into Gal- gal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.
<br>6	Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.
<br>7	You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land,
<br>8	Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon
<br> 
<br>the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.
<br>9	He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty.
<br>10	They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh per- fectly.
<br>11	Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them. 12 Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sins: enemies of the just, taking
<br>bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.
<br>13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time.
<br>14	Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.
<br>15	Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.
<br>16	Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are with- out, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament.
<br>17	And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
<br>18	Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.
<br>19	As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.
<br>20	Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it?
<br>21	I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assem- blies.
<br>22	And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.
<br>23	Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp.
<br>24	But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent.
<br>25	Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel?
<br>26	But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.
<br>27	And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion, and to you that have confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the people, that go in with state into the house of Israel.
<br>2	Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into Emath the great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border.
<br>3	You that are separated unto the evil day: and that approach to the throne of iniquity;
<br>4	You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your couches: that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the herd;
<br>5	You that sing to the sound of the psaltery:
<br> 
<br>they have thought themselves to have instru- ments of music like David;
<br>6	That drink wine in bowls, and anoint them- selves with the best ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph.
<br>7	Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken away.
<br>8	The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul, saith the Lord the God of hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his houses, and I will deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof.
<br>9	And if there remain ten men in one house, they also shall die.
<br>10	And a man’s kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn him, that he may carry the bones out of the house; and he shall say to him that is in the inner rooms of the house: Is there yet any with thee?
<br>11	And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall say to him: Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the Lord.
<br>12	For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.
<br>13	Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood.
<br>14	You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have we not taken unto us horns by our own strength?
<br>15	But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 7
<br>These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the locust was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king’s mowing.
<br>2	And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee: who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little?
<br>3	The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the Lord.
<br>4	These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a part at the same time.
<br>5	And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little one?
<br>6	The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God.
<br>7	These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason’s trowel.
<br>8	And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A mason’s trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more.
<br>9	And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
<br>10	And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: Amos hath re- belled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 11 For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be carried away
<br>captive out of their own land.
<br> 
<br>12	And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there.
<br>13	But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.
<br>14	And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.
<br>15	And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.
<br>16	And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Is- rael, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the house of the idol.
<br>17	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold a hook to draw down the fruit.
<br>2	And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.
<br>3	And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.
<br>4	Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail,
<br>5	Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,
<br>6	That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?
<br>7	The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I will never forget all their works.
<br>8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?
<br>9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:
<br>10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.
<br>11	Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.
<br>12	And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.
<br>13	In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for thirst.
<br>14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God, O Dan, liveth:  and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall, and shall rise no more.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said: Strike the hinges, and let the lintels be shook: for there is covetousness in the head of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall be no flight for them: they shall flee, and he that shall flee of them shall not be delivered.
<br>2	Though they go down even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them out: and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
<br>3	And though they be hid in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them away from thence: and though they hide themselves from my eyes in the depth of the sea, there will I com- mand the serpent and he shall bite them.
<br>4	And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall kill them. And I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
<br>5	And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth, and it shall melt: and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up as a river, and shall run down as the river of Egypt.
<br>6	He that buildeth his ascension in heaven, and hath founded his bundle upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name.
<br>7	Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord? did not I bring up Israel, out of the land of Egypt: and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of Cyrene?
<br>8	Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet I will not utterly
<br> 
<br>
<br>destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.
<br>9	For behold I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sleve: and there shall not a little stone fall to the ground.
<br>10	All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: who say: The evils shall not approach, and shall not come upon us.
<br>11	In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen: and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof, and repair what was fallen: and I will rebuild it as in the days of old.
<br>12	That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all nations, because my name is in- voked upon them: saith the Lord that doth these things.
<br>13	Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed: and the mountains shall drop sweetness, and ev- ery hill shall be tilled.
<br>14	And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel: and they shall build the aban- doned cities, and inhabit them: and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall make gardens, and eat the fruits of them. And I will plant them upon their own land: and I will no more pluck them out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God.

<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The vision of Abdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Edom: We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and he hath sent an ambassador to the na- tions: Arise, and let us rise up to battle against him.
<br>2	Behold I have made thee small among the nations: thou art exceeding contemptible.
<br>3	The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, who dwellest in the clefts of the rocks, and settest up thy throne on high: who sayest in thy heart: Who shall bring me down to the ground?
<br>4	Though thou be exalted as an eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars: thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
<br>5	If thieves had gone in to thee, if robbers by night, how wouldst thou have held thy peace? would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers had come in to thee, would they not have left thee at the least a cluster?
<br>6	How have they searched Esau, how have they sought out his hidden things?
<br>7	They have sent thee out even to the bor- der: all the men of thy confederacy have deceived thee: the men of thy peace have prevailed against thee: they that eat with thee shall lay snares un- der thee: there is no wisdom in him.
<br>8	Shall not I in that day, saith the Lord, de- stroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
<br> 
<br>9	And thy valiant men of the south shall be afraid, that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.
<br>10	For the slaughter, and for the iniquity against thy brother Jacob, confusion shall cover thee, and thou shalt perish for ever.
<br>11	In the day when thou stoodest against him, when strangers carried away his army captive, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem: thou also wast as one of them.
<br>12	But thou shalt not look on in the day of thy brother, in the day of his leaving his coun- try: and thou shalt not rejoice over the children of Juda, in the day of their destruction: and thou shalt not magnify thy mouth in the day of dis- tress.
<br>13	Neither shalt thou enter into the gate of my people in the day of their ruin: neither shalt thou also look on in his evils in the day of his calamity: and thou shalt not be sent out against his army in the day of his desolation.
<br>14	Neither shalt thou stand in the crossways to kill them that flee: and thou shalt not shut up them that remain of him in the day of tribu- lation.
<br>15	For the day of the Lord is at hand upon all nations: as thou hast done, so shall it be done to thee: he will turn thy reward upon thy own head.
<br>16	For as you have drunk upon my holy moun-
<br> 
<br>
<br>Prophecy of Abdias	1151
<br>
<br>tain, so all nations shall drink continually: and they shall drink, and sup up, and they shall be as though they were not.
<br>17	And in mount Sion shall be salvation, and it shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess those that possessed them.
<br>18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble: and they shall be kindled in them, and shall devour them: and there shall be no remains of the house of Esau, for the Lord hath spoken it.
<br>19	And they that are toward the south, shall inherit the mount of Esau, and they that are in the plains, the Philistines: and they shall pos- sess the country of Ephraim, and the country of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Galaad.
<br>20	And the captivity of this host of the chil- dren of Israel, all the places of the Chanaanites even to Sarepta: and the captivity of Jerusalem that is in Bosphorus, shall possess the cities of the south.
<br>21	And saviours shall come up into mount Sion to judge the mount of Esau: and the king- dom shall be for the Lord.

<br>Prophecy of Jonas
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas, the son of Amathi, saying:
<br>2	Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it: For the wickedness thereof is come up before me.
<br>3	And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord, 4 But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and
<br>the ship was in danger to be broken.
<br>5	And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.
<br>6	And the ship master came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us that we may not perish.
<br>7	And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.
<br>8	And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou?
<br> 
<br>or of what people art thou?
<br>9	And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.
<br>10	And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)
<br>11	And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.
<br>12	And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
<br>13	And the men rowed hard to return the land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.
<br>14	And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, oh Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.
<br>15	And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.
<br>16	And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to the Lord, and made vows.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Prophecy of Jonas	1153
<br> 
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.
<br>2	And Jonas prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the fish.
<br>3	And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.
<br>4	And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.
<br>5	And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see the holy temple again.
<br>6	The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.
<br>7	I went down to the lowest parts of the moun- tains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from cor- ruption, O Lord, my God.
<br>8	When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.
<br>9	They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.
<br>10	But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.
<br>11	And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonas upon the dry land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br>2	Arise, and go to Ninive, the great city: and preach in it the preaching that I bid thee.
<br>3	And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, ac- cording to the word of the Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three days’ journey.
<br>4	And Jonas began to enter into the city one day’s journey: and he cried and said: Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed.
<br>5	And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.
<br>6	And the word came to the king of Ninive: and he rose up out of his throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
<br>7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and pub- lished in Ninive, from the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen, nor sheep taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water.
<br>8	And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the Lord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands.
<br>9	Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive: and will turn away from his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?
<br>10	And God saw their works, that they were turned from their evil way: and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that he would do to them, and he did it not.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:
<br>2 And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I be- seech thee, O Lord, is not this what I said, when
<br> 
<br>
<br>1154	Prophecy of  Jonas
<br>
<br>I was yet in my own country? therefore I went before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.
<br>3	And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.
<br>4	And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?
<br>5	Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of the city: and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would befall the city.
<br>6	And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was fa- tigued): and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy. 7 But God prepared a worm, when the morn- ing arose on the following day: and it struck the
<br>ivy and it withered.
<br>8	And when the sun was risen, the Lord com- manded a hot and burning wind: and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the heat: and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is better for me to die than to live.
<br>9	And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death. 10 And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up,
<br>and in one night perished.
<br>11 And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know how to distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?

<br>
<br>Prophecy of Micheas
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The word of the Lord, that came to Micheas, the Morasthite, in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda: which he saw concern- ing Samaria and Jerusalem.
<br>2	Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple.
<br>3	For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.
<br>4	And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place.
<br>5	For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?
<br>6	And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.
<br>7	And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall
<br> 
<br>return.
<br>8	Therefore will I lament, and howl: I will go stript and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.
<br>9	Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
<br>10	Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ye not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.
<br>11	And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the house adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.
<br>12	For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.
<br>13	A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.
<br>14	Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to de- ceive the kings of Israel.
<br>15	Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.
<br>16	Make thee bald, and be polled for thy deli- cate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Woe to you that devise that which is unprof- itable, and work evil in your beds: in the morn- ing light they execute it, because their hand is against God.
<br>2	And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.
<br>3	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I de- vise an evil against this family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.
<br>4	In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: how shall he depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?
<br>5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the Lord. 6 Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon
<br>these, confusion shall not take them.
<br>7	The house of Jacob saith: Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened or are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him that walketh up- rightly?
<br>8	But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.
<br>9	You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise forever from their chil- dren.
<br>10	Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption. 11 Would God I were not a man that hath
<br> 
<br>the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkeness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.
<br>12	I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.
<br>13	For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And I said: Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of the house of Israel: Is it not your part to know judgment,
<br>2	You that hate good, and love evil: that vio- lently pluck off their skins from them and their flesh from their bones?
<br>3	Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin off them: and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of the pot.
<br>4	Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them: and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved wickedly in their devices.
<br>5	Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.
<br>6	Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to you instead of divination: and the sun shall go down upon the prophets,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and the day shall be darkened over them.
<br>7	And they shall be confounded that see vi- sions, and the diviners shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces, because there is no answer of God.
<br>8	But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord, with judgment and power: to declare unto Jacob his wickedness and to Israel his sin.
<br>9	Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel: you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right.
<br>10	You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<br>11	Her princes have judged for bribes: and her priests have taught for hire, and her prophets divined for money: and they leaned upon the Lord, saying: Is not the Lord in the midst of us? no evil shall come among us.
<br>12	Therefore because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain of the tem- ple as the high places of the forests.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountains, and high above the hills: and people shall flow to it.
<br>2	And many nations shall come in haste, and say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth out of Sion, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
<br>3	And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their
<br> 
<br>spears into spades: nation shall not take sword against nation: neither shall they learn war any- more.
<br>4	And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig tree, and there shall be none to make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken.
<br>5	For all people will walk every one in the name of his god: but we will walk in the name of the Lord, our God, for ever and ever.
<br>6	In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather up her that halteth: and her that I had cast out, I will gather up: and her whom I had afflicted.
<br>7	And I will make her that halted, a remnant: and her that had been afflicted, a mighty nation: and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Sion, from this time now and forever.
<br>8	And thou, O cloudy tower of the flock, of the daughter of Sion, unto thee shall it come: yea the first power shall come, the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.
<br>9	Now, why art thou drawn together with grief? Hast thou no king in thee, or is thy coun- selor perished, because sorrow hath taken thee as a woman in labour.
<br>10	Be in pain and labour, O daughter of Sion, as a woman that bringeth forth: for now shalt thou go out of the city, and shalt dwell in the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there thou shalt be delivered: there the Lord will re- deem thee out of the hand of thy enemies.
<br>11	And now many nations are gathered to- gether against thee, and they say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon Sion.
<br>12	But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord, and have not understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them together as the hay of the floor.
<br>13	Arise, and tread, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thy horn iron, and thy hoofs I will
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>make brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples, and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of the whole earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now shalt thou be laid waste, O daughter of the robber: they have laid siege against us, with a rod shall they strike the cheek of the judge of Israel.
<br>2	And thou Bethlehem Ephrata, art a little one among the thousands of Juda, out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel: and his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity.
<br>3	Therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth: and the remnant of his brethren shall be converted to the children of Israel.
<br>4	And he shall stand, and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the height of the name of the Lord, his God: and they shall be converted, for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth.
<br>5	And this man shall be our peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall set his foot in our houses: and we shall raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
<br>6	And they shall feed the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nemrod with the spears thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian when he shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our borders.
<br>7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, as a dew from the Lord, and as drops upon the grass, which waiteth not for man, nor tarrieth for the children of men.
<br> 
<br>8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forests, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, when he shall go through, and tread down, and take there is none to deliver.
<br>9	Thy hand shall be lifted up over thy enemies, and all thy enemies shall be cut off.
<br>10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will take away thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots. 11 And I will destroy the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strong holds, and I will take away sorceries out of thy hand, and
<br>there shall be no divinations in thee.
<br>12	And I will destroy thy graven things, and thy statues, out of the midst of thee: and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands.
<br>13	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: and will crush thy cities.
<br>14	And I will execute vengeance in wrath, and in indignation, among all the nations that have not given ear.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Hear ye what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou in judgment against the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
<br>2	Let the mountains hear the judgment of the Lord, and the strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord will enter into judgment with his people, and he will plead against Israel.
<br>3	O my people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I molested thee? answer thou me. 4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and delivered thee out of the house of slaves: and I sent before thy face  Moses, and
<br>Aaron, and Mary.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	O my people, remember, I pray thee, what Balach, the king of Moab, purposed: and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him, from Setim to Galgal, that thou mightest know the justice of the Lord.
<br>6	What shall I offer to the Lord that is worthy? wherewith shall I kneel before the high God? shall I offer holocausts unto him, and calves of a year old?
<br>7 May the Lord be appeased with thousands of rams, or with many thousands of fat he goats? shall I give my firstborn for my wickedness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
<br>8	I will shew thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee: Verily to do judgment, and to love mercy, and to walk solici- tous with thy God.
<br>9	The voice of the Lord crieth to the city, and salvation shall be to them that fear thy name: hear O ye tribes, and who shall approve it?
<br>10	As yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked, the treasures of iniquity, and a scant measure full of wrath.
<br>11	Shall I justify wicked balances, and the de- ceitful weights of the bag?
<br>12	By which her rich men were filled with iniquity, and the inhabitants thereof have spo- ken lies, and their tongue was deceitful in their mouth.
<br>13	And I therefore began to strike thee with desolation for thy sins.
<br>14	Thou shalt eat, but shalt not be filled: and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not save: and those whom thou shalt save, I will give up to the sword.
<br>15	Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not be anointed with oil: and the new wine, but shalt not drink the wine.
<br> 
<br>16	For thou hast kept the statutes of Amri, and all the works of the house of Achab: and thou hast walked according their wills, that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhab- itants thereof a hissing, and you shall bear the reproach of my people.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Woe is me, for I am become as one that gleaneth in autumn the grapes of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat, my soul desired the first ripe figs. 2 The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, every one hunteth his brother
<br>to death.
<br>3	The evil of their hands they call good: the prince requireth, and the judge is for giving: and the great man hath uttered the desire of his soul, and they have troubled it.
<br>4	He that is best among them, is as a brier, and he that is righteous, as the thorn of the hedge. The day of thy inspection, thy visitation cometh: now shall be their destruction.
<br>5	Believe not a friend, and trust not in a prince: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.
<br>6	For the son dishonoureth the father, and the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a man’s enemies are they of his own household. 7 But I will look towards the Lord, I will wait
<br>for God, my saviour: my God will hear me.
<br>8	Rejoice not, thou my enemy, over me, be- cause I am fallen: I shall arise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.
<br>9	I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him: until he judge my cause, and execute judgement for me: he will
<br> 
<br>
<br>bring me forth into the light, I shall behold his justice.
<br>10	And my enemy shall behold, and she shall be covered with shame, who saith to me: Where is the Lord thy God? my eyes shall look down upon her: now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the streets.
<br>11	The day shall come, that thy walls may be built up: in that day shall the law be far removed.
<br>12	In that day they shall come even from As- syria to thee, and to the fortified cities: and from the fortified cities even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
<br>13	And the land shall be made desolate be- cause of the inhabitants thereof, and for the fruit of their devices.
<br>14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy inheritance, them that dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed in Basan and Galaad, according to the days of old. 15 According to the days of thy coming out of
<br>the land of Egypt, I will shew him wonders.
<br>16	The nations shall see, and shall be con- founded at all their strength: they shall put the hand upon the mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
<br>17	They shall lick the dust like serpents, as the creeping things of the earth, they shall be disturbed in their houses: they shall dread the Lord, our God, and shall fear thee.
<br>18	Who is a God like to thee, who takest away iniquity, and passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance? he will send his fury in no more, because he delighteth in mercy.
<br>19	He will turn again, and have mercy on us: he will put away our iniquities: and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea.
<br>20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, the mercy to Abraham: which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

<br>Prophecy of Nahum
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elcesite.
<br>2	The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.
<br>3	The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord’s ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.
<br>4	He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan lan- guisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus fadeth away.
<br>5	The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.
<br>6	Who can stand before the face of his indig- nation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.
<br>7	The Lord is good, and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.
<br>8	But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place thereof: and dark- ness shall pursue his enemies.
<br>9	What do ye devise against the Lord? he will
<br> 
<br>make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.
<br>10	For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.
<br>11	Out of thee shall come forth one that imag- ineth evil against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.
<br>12	Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more.
<br>13	And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.
<br>14	And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.
<br>15	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep the siege: watch the way, fortify
<br> 
<br>
<br>1162	Prophecy of  Nahum
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy loins, strengthen thy power exceedingly.
<br>2	For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Ja- cob, as the pride of Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their vine branches.
<br>3	The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his prepa- ration, and the drivers are stupified.
<br>4	They are in confusion in the ways, the chari- ots jostle one against another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning running to and fro.
<br>5	He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering shall be prepared.
<br>6	The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down to the ground.
<br>7	And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts.
<br>8	And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool: but the men flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.
<br>9	Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.
<br>10	She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.
<br>11	Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them afraid?
<br>12	The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.
<br>13	Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord
<br> 
<br>of hosts, and I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Woe to thee, 0 city of blood, all full of lies and violence: rapine shall not depart from thee.
<br>2	The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the neighing horse; and of the running chariot, and of the horsemen coming up,
<br>3	And of the shining sword, and of thc glit- tering spear, and of a multitude slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there is no end of car- casses, and they shall fall down on their dead bodies.
<br>4	Because of the multitude of the fornica- tions of the harlot that was beautiful and agree- able, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold nations through her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts.
<br>5	Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will discover thy shame to thy face, and will shew thy nakedness to the nations, and thy shame to kingdoms.
<br>6	And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace thee, and will make an example of thee.
<br>7	And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee, shall flee from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste: who shall bemoan thee? whence shall I seek a comforter for thee?
<br>8	Art thou better than the populous Alexan- dria, that dwelleth among the rivers? waters are round about it: the sea is its riches: the waters are its walls.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Prophecy of Nahum	1163
<br> 
<br>
<br>9	Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof, and there is no end: Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers.
<br>10	Yet she also was removed and carried into cap- tivity: her young children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street, and they cast lots upon her nobles, and all her great men were bound in fetters.
<br>11	Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be despised: and thou shalt seek help from the enemies.
<br>12	All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green figs: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.
<br>13	Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire shall devour thy bars.
<br>14	Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go into the clay, and tread, work it and make brick.
<br>15	There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by the sword, it shall devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together like the bruchus, make thyself many like the locust.
<br>16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven: the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away.
<br>17	Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy lit- tle ones like the locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold: the sun arose, and they flew away, and their place was not known where they were.
<br>18	Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria, thy princes shall be buried: thy people are hid in the mountains, and there is none to gather them.
<br>19	Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all that have heard the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over thee: for upon
<br> 
<br>
<br>whom hath not thy wickedness passed continu- ally?

<br>Prophecy of Habacuc
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The burden that Habacuc the prophet saw.
<br>2	How long, O Lord, shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? shall I cry out to thee suffering vio- lence, and thou wilt not save?
<br>3	Why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance, to see rapine and injustice before me? and there is a judgment, but opposition is more powerful.
<br>4	Therefore the law is torn in pieces, and judg- ment cometh not to the end: because the wicked prevaileth against the just, therefore wrong judg- ment goeth forth.
<br>5	Behold ye among the nations, and see: won- der, and be astonished: for a work is done in your days, which no man will believe when it shall be told.
<br>6	For behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation, marching upon the breadth of the earth, to possess the dwelling places that are not their own.
<br>7	They are dreadful, and terrible: from them- selves shall their judgment, and their burden proceed.
<br>8	Their horses are lighter than leopards, and swifter than evening wolves; and their horsemen shall be spread abroad: for their horsemen shall come from afar, they shall fly as an eagle that maketh haste to eat.
<br>9	They shall all come to the prey, their face
<br> 
<br>is like a burning wind: and they shall gather together captives as the sand.
